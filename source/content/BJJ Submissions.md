# BJJ Submissions: Complete Finishing Techniques Guide

Submissions are the ultimate objective in Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu - techniques that force an opponent to "tap out" (submit) due to pain, injury risk, or loss of consciousness. This comprehensive guide organizes all BJJ submissions by attack type, helping you understand submission mechanics, chains, and strategic applications.

## Quick Navigation

- [Chokes & Strangles](#chokes--strangles) - Blood and air chokes
- [Arm Locks](#arm-locks) - Elbow and shoulder attacks
- [Leg Locks](#leg-locks) - Knee, ankle, and heel attacks
- [Shoulder Attacks](#shoulder-attacks) - Rotational joint locks
- [Compression & Specialty](#compression--specialty) - Pressure submissions
- [Submission Systems](#submission-systems) - Strategic frameworks
- [Learning Path](#learning-path-by-skill-level) - Skill progression

---

## Understanding Submissions

Every submission in BJJ targets one of these mechanisms:

### Attack Mechanisms

1. **Blood Chokes (Strangles)**
   - Target: Carotid arteries
   - Time to unconsciousness: 5-10 seconds
   - Safety: Relatively safe when applied correctly
   - Examples: Rear naked choke, triangle, guillotine

2. **Air Chokes**
   - Target: Trachea/airway
   - Time to tap: 10-30 seconds
   - Safety: Higher risk of injury
   - Examples: Ezekiel, baseball bat choke

3. **Joint Locks**
   - Target: Joints (elbow, shoulder, knee, ankle)
   - Mechanism: Hyperextension or rotation beyond normal range
   - Safety: High injury risk if applied too fast
   - Examples: Armbar, kimura, kneebar

4. **Compression Attacks**
   - Target: Muscles, ligaments, nerves
   - Mechanism: Crushing pressure or stretching
   - Safety: Painful but lower injury risk
   - Examples: Calf slicer, bicep slicer

### Submission Timing

Submissions succeed through:
- **Position Control** → Dominant position first
- **Isolation** → Control the target limb/neck
- **Pressure** → Apply technique gradually
- **Commitment** → Follow through completely

---

## Safety & Training Principles

### Tap Early, Tap Often

- Joint locks can cause permanent damage
- Chokes can cause unconsciousness in seconds
- Ego has no place in training
- Protect yourself and training partners

### Submission Application Rules

1. **Control First** - Secure position before finishing
2. **Apply Gradually** - Slow, steady pressure
3. **Respect the Tap** - Release immediately when partner taps
4. **Verbal Tap Counts** - "Tap" said verbally is a tap
5. **Going Limp = Tap** - If partner goes limp in choke, release immediately

### High-Risk Submissions (Train Carefully)

- **Heel hooks** - Can tear multiple ligaments instantly
- **Kneebars** - Hyperextension damage to knee
- **Neck cranks** - Spinal injury risk
- **Twister** - Requires very controlled application
- **Calf slicers** - Painful but lower injury risk

---

## Defensive Priorities

When caught in submissions, defend in this order:

1. **Prevent the finish** - Stop the immediate threat
2. **Escape the control** - Get out of the submission position
3. **Recover position** - Return to safe position
4. **Counter-attack** - Turn defense into offense

### Common Defense Principles

- **Stack** - Use weight to relieve pressure (chokes, armbars)
- **Hitchhiker** - Rotate thumb up and pull out (arm locks)
- **Posture** - Break control before they finish (triangles, guillotines)
- **Straighten** - Extend leg to relieve pressure (leg locks)
- **Hand fighting** - Prevent grips from completing (all submissions)

## The Submission Mindset

"Position before submission" is the foundational principle, but advanced practitioners develop a submission-focused game where:

- Every position threatens multiple submissions
- Opponent's defensive reaction creates the next attack
- Position advancement and submission attempts are simultaneous
- Constant pressure forces mistakes

The goal is not to force a single submission, but to create an environment where the opponent has no good defensive options - every defense opens another attack.
