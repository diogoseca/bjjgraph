# BJJ State Machine Canvas
#bjj #system #visualization #canvas

This file serves as documentation for the BJJ State Machine Canvas visualization. To view the canvas, click on the filename in Obsidian's file explorer and select "Open as canvas" or create a new canvas and manually add the nodes described below.

## Canvas Overview

The BJJ State Machine Canvas provides a complete visual representation of the Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu positional hierarchy as a directed graph, with:

- **Nodes (States)**: Represented as rounded rectangles, color-coded by position type
- **Edges (Transitions)**: Represented as arrows connecting states, labeled with technique names
- **Weights**: Indicated by line thickness representing success probability

## Canvas Structure

The canvas is organized in a hierarchical layout with the following sections:

### 1. Standing Position (Top)
- Starting point of all exchanges
- Branches to takedowns and guard pulls

### 2. Guard Positions (Left Section)
- Closed Guard
- Half Guard variations
- Open Guard family
- Leg entanglement system

### 3. Dominant Positions (Right Section)
- Side Control
- Mount
- Back Control
- Submission control positions

### 4. Terminal State (Bottom)
- Won by Submission (victory condition)

## Color Coding

States are color-coded for quick visual identification:

- **Green**: Neutral positions (Standing, Closed Guard)
- **Blue**: Bottom positions (Open Guard, Half Guard, etc.)
- **Orange**: Top positions (Side Control, Mount)
- **Red**: Dominant control positions (Back Control, Inside Sankaku)
- **Purple**: Submission control positions (Triangle Control, Armbar Control)
- **Black**: Terminal state (Won by Submission)

## Optimal Paths Highlighted

The canvas highlights four optimal paths to submission with thicker, colored arrows:

### Path 1: Positional Dominance (Blue)
Standing → Double Leg Takedown → Side Control → Mount → Arm Triangle → Won by Submission

### Path 2: Bottom Game (Green)
Standing → Pull Guard → Closed Guard Bottom → Triangle Control → Triangle Finish → Won by Submission

## Implementing the Canvas in Obsidian

To create this canvas in Obsidian:

1. Create a new canvas (click the canvas icon in the left sidebar)
2. Add nodes for each state listed above
3. Connect nodes with arrows representing transitions
4. Color-code nodes according to the scheme above
5. Adjust node size based on positional importance
6. Highlight optimal paths with thicker, colored arrows
7. Add labels to both nodes and edges
8. Save the canvas as "BJJ State Machine Canvas"

## Using the Canvas for Learning

The canvas offers several learning applications:

1. **Path Analysis**: Identify multiple paths from your current position to submission
2. **Gap Identification**: Find areas of your game with limited connections
3. **Sequence Planning**: Create training sequences by following specific paths
4. **Technique Contextualization**: Understand where individual techniques fit in the larger system
5. **Decision Point Recognition**: Identify key branching positions that offer multiple strategic options

## Alternative Views

The canvas can be reorganized to highlight different aspects of the BJJ system:

- **Point-Based View**: Arrange by positional hierarchy (0-4 points)
- **Expert-Based View**: Group by prominent practitioner systems (Danaher, Ryan, Bravo)
- **Tournament-Legal View**: Filter by competition legality (IBJJF rules)
- **Energy Efficiency View**: Organize by physical exertion required

## Canvas Updates

As you add more states and transitions to your knowledge base, update the canvas to include these new elements, maintaining the visual coherence of the system while expanding its complexity and comprehensiveness.
