## State Machine Content Elements

### Visual Execution Sequence
Detailed step-by-step description for clear movement sequence visualization:

From a dominant top position such as Side Control, North-South, or Knee on Belly, you start by isolating the opponent's far arm, which is the arm furthest from your body, using your near arm to control their wrist or elbow while pinning their torso with your chest or knee. Secure their far arm by trapping it against your body, often by hugging it to your chest or using an underhook to prevent their defensive movement. Transition your hips by stepping over their head with your near leg, positioning your body perpendicular to theirs, ensuring their arm is extended with the elbow aligned with your hip for maximum leverage. Drop your weight onto their chest or torso to pin them while simultaneously pulling their arm straight and lifting your hips to apply pressure on the elbow joint. Maintain control of their wrist and keep their thumb pointing upwards to ensure the correct angle of attack, applying steady pressure until the opponent submits due to the hyperextension of the elbow.

**Template**: "From Side Control or similar, isolate far arm with near arm control. Trap arm against body, step over head with near leg. Position perpendicular, align elbow with hip. Drop weight to pin, pull arm straight, lift hips for elbow pressure until submission."

### Execution Steps (Numbered Sequence)
1. **Setup Requirements**: Establish dominant position ([[Side Control]], [[North-South]], [[Knee on Belly]])
2. **Initial Movement**: Isolate opponent's far arm using near arm to control wrist or elbow
3. **Opponent Response**: Opponent may attempt to pull arm back or turn to defend
4. **Adaptation**: Secure far arm by trapping against body with hug or underhook
5. **Positioning**: Step over opponent's head with near leg, align body perpendicular
6. **Pressure Application**: Drop weight to pin torso, pull arm straight, lift hips for elbow pressure
7. **Completion**: Maintain wrist control, ensure thumb up, apply steady pressure until submission

### Key Technical Details
Critical elements that determine success:
- **Grip Requirements**: Strong control of opponent's wrist to prevent pull-back
- **Base/Foundation**: Weight distribution to pin opponent's torso effectively
- **Timing Windows**: Execute when opponent's far arm is exposed or overextended
- **Leverage Points**: Hip alignment with elbow for maximum joint pressure
- **Common Adjustments**: Adjust hip position and arm pull based on defensive reactions

### Success Modifiers
Factors that increase/decrease probability:
- **Setup Quality**: Security of far arm isolation and control (+/-20%)
- **Timing Precision**: Executing when arm is exposed or overextended (+/-15%)
- **Opponent Fatigue**: Reduced defensive strength over time (+/-5%)
- **Knowledge Test Performance**: Understanding armbar mechanics (+/-10%)
- **Positional Control**: Effectiveness of torso pinning and hip alignment (+/-10%)

## Counter-Attack Analysis

### Common Counters
Opponent responses with success rates:
- **Arm Pull-Back**: Retracting arm to prevent isolation → [[Arm Defense]] (Success Rate: 30%, Conditions: early reaction)
- **Turn to Knees**: Turning to turtle to escape pin → [[Turtle Position]] (Success Rate: 20%, Conditions: quick movement)
- **Hitchhiker Escape**: Rotating thumb down to relieve pressure → [[Pressure Reduction]] (Success Rate: 15%, Conditions: correct angle)
- **Stack Defense**: Stacking to disrupt hip alignment → [[Stacking Defense]] (Success Rate: 10%, Conditions: strong base)
- **Bridge Escape**: Bridging to create space → [[Position Disruption]] (Success Rate: 10%, Conditions: explosive movement)

Format: `[[Counter Technique]] → [[Result State]] (Success Rate: X%, Conditions: [when applicable])`

### Decision Logic for Opponent Behavior
```
If [far side armbar setup] is not fully secured:
- Execute [[Arm Pull-Back]] (Probability: 30%)

Else if [turn to knees] can escape pin:
- Execute [[Turn to Knees]] (Probability: 20%)

Else if [hitchhiker escape] relieves pressure:
- Execute [[Hitchhiker Escape]] (Probability: 15%)

Else if [stack defense] disrupts alignment:
- Execute [[Stack Defense]] (Probability: 10%)

Else [optimal submission execution]:
- Accept submission (Probability: Success Rate - Modifiers)
```

## Defensive Considerations

### Common Threats During Attempt
Primary risks while attempting this submission:
- **Arm Retraction**: Opponent pulls arm back to prevent isolation → [[Arm Defense]] (Threat Level: Medium)
- **Positional Escape**: Opponent turns to knees or other position → [[Turtle Position]] (Threat Level: Medium)
- **Pressure Relief**: Opponent uses hitchhiker escape → [[Pressure Reduction]] (Threat Level: Low)
- **Alignment Disruption**: Opponent stacks or bridges → [[Stacking Defense]] (Threat Level: Low)

Format: `[[Threat Type]] → [[Resulting Position]] (Threat Level: X)`

### Defensive Strategies
Methods to mitigate threats:
- **Wrist Control**: Maintain tight grip on wrist to prevent arm retraction
- **Torso Pinning**: Use weight effectively to block turning or bridging
- **Hip Alignment**: Keep hips aligned with elbow to counter pressure relief
- **Leg Positioning**: Secure leg over head to limit stacking or escape movement
- **Adaptation Readiness**: Be prepared to switch to other submissions or controls if armbar fails
