## State Machine Content Elements

### Visual Execution Sequence
Detailed step-by-step description for clear movement sequence visualization:

From the Truck Position, you start with a tight figure-four leg entanglement on one of the opponent's legs, ensuring complete control as you prepare to target their free leg. Your outside arm secures a grip on their free leg, typically at the ankle or shin, while your other arm controls their upper body by gripping their collar, arm, or head to prevent defensive rotation. You adjust your body to a perpendicular angle relative to the opponent, elevating your hips and driving them forward to create the foundation for the stretching force. Then, you pull their free leg toward their head while pushing their upper body in the opposite direction, generating a powerful split that applies intense pressure to their groin and inner thigh muscles until they submit or tap out due to the discomfort or potential muscle strain.

**Template**: "From Truck Position, secure figure-four on one leg and grip their free leg at ankle or shin. Control their upper body with your other arm to block rotation. Adjust to a perpendicular angle, elevate hips, and drive forward. Pull free leg toward head and push upper body opposite for a groin stretch until submission."

### Execution Steps (Numbered Sequence)
1. **Setup Requirements**: Establish complete Truck Position with figure-four leg entanglement
2. **Initial Movement**: Secure grip on opponent's free leg at ankle or shin
3. **Opponent Response**: Opponent may attempt to extend leg or turn upper body
4. **Adaptation**: Use outside arm to control their upper body (collar, arm, or head)
5. **Positioning**: Adjust to perpendicular angle, elevate and drive hips forward
6. **Pressure Application**: Pull free leg toward head while pushing upper body opposite
7. **Completion**: Maintain control and increase stretching pressure for submission

### Key Technical Details
Critical elements that determine success:
- **Grip Requirements**: Strong hold on free leg at ankle or shin for leverage
- **Base/Foundation**: Tight figure-four control in Truck Position for stability
- **Timing Windows**: Execute after full Truck control is established
- **Leverage Points**: Hip drive and opposing force vectors for stretching pressure
- **Common Adjustments**: Fine-tune angle and grip based on defensive reactions

### Success Modifiers
Factors that increase/decrease probability:
- **Setup Quality**: Strong figure-four and Truck Position control (+/-20%)
- **Timing Precision**: Executing before opponent counters Truck control (+/-15%)
- **Opponent Fatigue**: Reduced defensive mobility over time (+/-5%)
- **Knowledge Test Performance**: Understanding stretching mechanics (+/-10%)
- **Hip Drive Effectiveness**: Power and angle of hip elevation (+/-10%)

## Counter-Attack Analysis

### Common Counters
Opponent responses with success rates:
- **Hip Escape**: Shrimping to reduce angle of stretch → [[Angle Reduction]] (Success Rate: 40%, Conditions: early reaction)
- **Leg Extension**: Straightening free leg to relieve pressure → [[Pressure Relief]] (Success Rate: 35%, Conditions: strong leg control)
- **Upper Body Turn**: Rotating torso to change alignment → [[Alignment Change]] (Success Rate: 30%, Conditions: upper body mobility)
- **Forward Roll**: Rolling forward to escape position → [[Escape Attempt]] (Success Rate: 25%, Conditions: significant momentum)
- **Grip Fighting**: Breaking grip on free leg or upper body → [[Control Break]] (Success Rate: 20%, Conditions: quick grip defense)

Format: `[[Counter Technique]] → [[Result State]] (Success Rate: X%, Conditions: [when applicable])`

### Decision Logic for Opponent Behavior
```
If [banana split setup] is not fully secured:
- Execute [[Hip Escape]] (Probability: 40%)

Else if [leg control] allows straightening:
- Execute [[Leg Extension]] (Probability: 35%)

Else if [upper body] has mobility:
- Execute [[Upper Body Turn]] (Probability: 30%)

Else if [momentum] can be created:
- Execute [[Forward Roll]] (Probability: 25%)

Else [optimal submission execution]:
- Accept submission (Probability: Success Rate - Modifiers)
```

## Defensive Considerations

### Common Threats During Attempt
Primary risks while attempting this submission:
- **Position Loss**: Opponent escapes Truck Position → [[Escape Attempt]] (Threat Level: Medium)
- **Counter Submission**: Opponent attacks with leg locks if control slips → [[Leg Lock Control]] (Threat Level: Low)
- **Escape**: Opponent breaks grip and reduces angle → [[Angle Reduction]] (Threat Level: Medium)
- **Stalemate**: Opponent stalls with strong defensive posture → [[Pressure Relief]] (Threat Level: Low)

Format: `[[Threat Type]] → [[Resulting Position]] (Threat Level: X)`

### Defensive Strategies
Methods to mitigate threats:
- **Figure-Four Maintenance**: Keep tight control on entangled leg to prevent escape
- **Grip Security**: Maintain strong holds on free leg and upper body
- **Hip Drive**: Use continuous forward pressure to limit opponent's mobility
- **Angle Adjustment**: Optimize perpendicular positioning to maximize stretch
- **Defensive Awareness**: Anticipate and counter hip escapes or rolls early

## Educational Content

### Expert Insights
Commentary as if from recognized authorities:
- **John Danaher**: "While not a primary focus in my system, the Banana Split showcases the power of multidirectional pressure. Its effectiveness lies in targeting multiple anatomical structures simultaneously, making defense challenging. This submission illustrates how unique angles can create devastating mechanical advantages."
- **Gordon Ryan**: "The Banana Split is a specialized tool that shines when Truck Position control is absolute. I focus on precise angle creation and progressive pressure to avoid giving the opponent defensive windows. It demonstrates how unconventional submissions can catch even skilled grapplers off-guard."
- **Eddie Bravo**: "As a signature move in the 10th Planet system, the Banana Split is a game-changer from the Truck Position. The key is coordinating upper and lower body control with powerful hip drive to maximize the stretch. This technique embodies our approach to innovative submissions that exploit unique body mechanics."

Each insight should focus on one key technical or strategic element.

### Common Errors
For knowledge test generation:
- **Error**: Insufficient figure-four control in Truck Position
- **Why It Fails**: Allows opponent to escape or reduce stretching pressure
- **Correction**: Maintain tight entanglement to secure base for submission
- **Recognition**: Opponent easily pulls entangled leg free during attempt

- **Error**: Poor grip on free leg or upper body
- **Why It Fails**: Reduces ability to create opposing force vectors for stretch
- **Correction**: Secure strong holds at ankle/shin and collar/arm/head
- **Recognition**: Opponent moves free leg or torso without resistance

- **Error**: Inadequate hip drive or improper angle
- **Why It Fails**: Limits stretching pressure on groin and inner thigh
- **Correction**: Elevate hips and drive forward at perpendicular angle
- **Recognition**: Submission feels weak despite leg and body control

### Timing Considerations
When to attempt this submission:
- **Optimal Conditions**: After complete Truck Position control is established
