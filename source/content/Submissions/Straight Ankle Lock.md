## ⚠️ SAFETY NOTICE

**This submission can cause ACHILLES TENDON RUPTURE if applied improperly.**

- **Injury Risks**: Achilles rupture (4-6 months recovery), ankle ligament damage, joint hyperextension
- **Application Speed**: SLOW and controlled. 3-5 seconds minimum.
- **Tap Signals**: Verbal "tap", physical tap with hands/feet
- **Release Protocol**: Release immediately, lower foot gently, check ankle
- **Never**: Apply explosive "breaking" motion

**Remember**: Your partner needs their ankles to walk and train. Apply slowly, release immediately.

## Overview

The straight ankle lock is the most fundamental leg lock in BJJ, targeting the ankle joint through hyperextension while applying pressure to the Achilles tendon. Legal at all belt levels in IBJJF, it's the entry point for leg lock study.

From [[Ashi Garami]], secure the opponent's foot across your body, trap the heel in your armpit, and extend the ankle by pulling with arms while driving hips forward. Success rates: Beginner 35%, Intermediate 55%, Advanced 70%.

## Expert Insights

### John Danaher
> "The straight ankle lock is the foundation of all leg lock study. It teaches control, isolation, and progressive pressure. Hip drive creates extension - arms alone are insufficient. The progressive feedback allows safer learning than heel hooks."

### Gordon Ryan
> "Straight ankle locks are fundamental. I've finished world-class opponents with them. Apply slowly in training (5-7 seconds), fast in competition. Your ankles need to last your whole career - be smart."

### Eddie Bravo
> "Ankle locks are allowed everywhere. We drill them constantly because they're fundamental, but always slow and controlled. Fast ankle locks are for competition. In the gym, everybody goes home healthy."

## Knowledge Assessment

1. **Setup Requirements**: Ashi garami established, foot secured, heel in armpit, arms wrapped, hip angle perpendicular
2. **Mechanics**: Arms pull + hips drive forward = hyperextension of ankle joint
3. **Safety**: 3-5 seconds minimum, release immediately on tap, Achilles rupture is primary risk
4. **Defense**: Early leg extraction (55% success), forward roll (30%), tap before severe pain
5. **Anatomy**: Targets ankle joint and Achilles tendon - rupture requires surgery and 4-6 months recovery
6. **Release Protocol**: Stop arm pull, stop hip drive, lower foot gently, release entanglement, check mobility
