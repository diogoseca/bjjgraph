## State Machine Content Elements

### Visual Execution Sequence
Detailed step-by-step description for clear movement sequence visualization:

From the North-South position, you start by sliding your non-choking arm under the opponent's head to establish a base for control and leverage. Position your choking arm across their neck, ensuring your bicep and forearm form a V-shape to target the carotid arteries effectively. Connect your hands in a gable grip or clasp your choking hand around your opposite wrist or forearm to secure the hold, while dropping your shoulder and chest toward the mat to create downward pressure. Keep your head low and tight to the opponent's body to prevent defensive space, maintain hip pressure to block turning or bridging attempts, and squeeze by expanding your chest and pinching your elbows together rather than pulling with your arms, adjusting the angle as needed to maximize compression on the carotid arteries until they submit due to the intense strangle.

**Template**: "From North-South, slide non-choking arm under head. Position choking arm in V-shape across neck. Connect hands in gable grip, drop shoulder for pressure. Keep head low, maintain hip control, squeeze with chest until submission."

### Execution Steps (Numbered Sequence)
1. **Setup Requirements**: Establish position (North-South)
2. **Initial Movement**: Slide non-choking arm under opponent's head for base
3. **Opponent Response**: Opponent may attempt to frame or turn to escape
4. **Adaptation**: Position choking arm across neck with bicep and forearm in V-shape
5. **Positioning**: Connect hands in gable grip or wrist clasp, drop shoulder and chest
6. **Pressure Application**: Keep head low, maintain hip pressure, squeeze with chest expansion
7. **Completion**: Adjust angle for carotid compression, maintain control until submission

### Key Technical Details
Critical elements that determine success:
- **Grip Requirements**: Gable grip or wrist clasp for secure control
- **Base/Foundation**: Non-choking arm under head for leverage and stability
- **Timing Windows**: Execute when opponent's arms are occupied or extended
- **Leverage Points**: Chest and shoulder pressure for carotid compression
- **Common Adjustments**: Adjust arm angle and head position based on resistance

### Success Modifiers
Factors that increase/decrease probability:
- **Setup Quality**: Security of arm positioning and grip control (+/-20%)
- **Timing Precision**: Executing before opponent frames or escapes (+/-15%)
- **Opponent Fatigue**: Reduced defensive mobility over time (+/-5%)
- **Knowledge Test Performance**: Understanding V-shape mechanics and pressure (+/-10%)
- **Positional Control**: Effectiveness of hip pressure and head alignment (+/-10%)

## Counter-Attack Analysis

### Common Counters
Opponent responses with success rates:
- **Frame and Create Space**: Framing to prevent pressure → [[North-South Escape]] (Success Rate: 25%, Conditions: early reaction)
- **Roll to Side**: Rolling to disrupt control → [[Side Control Escape]] (Success Rate: 20%, Conditions: strong hip movement)
- **Shoulder Walk**: Walking shoulders to create angle → [[Guard Recovery]] (Success Rate: 15%, Conditions: quick adjustment)
- **Hand Fighting**: Fighting arms to break grip → [[Defensive Position]] (Success Rate: 10%, Conditions: significant grip strength)
- **Bridge and Shrimp**: Bridging to create space → [[Half Guard Recovery]] (Success Rate: 10%, Conditions: quick anticipation)

Format: `[[Counter Technique]] → [[Result State]] (Success Rate: X%, Conditions: [when applicable])`

### Decision Logic for Opponent Behavior
```
If [north-south choke setup] is not fully secured:
- Execute [[Frame and Create Space]] (Probability: 25%)

Else if [rolling] can disrupt control:
- Execute [[Roll to Side]] (Probability: 20%)

Else if [shoulder walk] allows angle creation:
- Execute [[Shoulder Walk]] (Probability: 15%)

Else if [grip strength] permits breaking control:
- Execute [[Hand Fighting]] (Probability: 10%)

Else [optimal submission execution]:
- Accept submission (Probability: Success Rate - Modifiers)
```

## Defensive Considerations

### Common Threats During Attempt
Primary risks while attempting this submission:
- **Frame Creation**: Opponent frames to prevent pressure → [[North-South Escape]] (Threat Level: Medium)
- **Position Loss**: Opponent rolls or escapes control → [[Side Control Escape]] (Threat Level: Medium)
- **Counter Attack**: Opponent walks shoulders for angle → [[Guard Recovery]] (Threat Level: Low)
- **Stalemate**: Opponent breaks grip to stall submission → [[Defensive Position]] (Threat Level: Medium)

Format: `[[Threat Type]] → [[Resulting Position]] (Threat Level: X)`

### Defensive Strategies
Methods to mitigate threats:
- **Grip Maintenance**: Secure tight gable grip or wrist clasp to prevent breaks
- **Head Control**: Keep head low and tight to avoid framing space
- **Hip Pressure**: Maintain strong hip connection to block rolling or bridging
- **Angle Adjustment**: Adjust shoulder and chest pressure to counter shoulder walks
- **Adaptation Readiness**: Be prepared to switch to other submissions if defended

## Educational Content

### Expert Insights
Commentary as if from recognized authorities:
- **John Danaher**: "The North-South Choke's precision in mechanical alignment is key. The V-shape of the arm targets carotid arteries efficiently. It’s a systematic finish from a dominant position."
- **Gordon Ryan**: "I use the North-South Choke to counter defensive reactions. Heavy chest pressure prevents escapes before the choke sets. It’s a high-percentage upper body attack."
- **Eddie Bravo**: "In 10th Planet, modified North-South Chokes connect with unorthodox controls like the Truck. It forces positional advancement even if unfinished. The threat opens other attacks."

Each insight should focus on one key technical or strategic element.

### Common Errors
For knowledge test generation:
- **Error**: Squeezing with arms only instead of chest expansion
- **Why It Fails**: Reduces effective pressure on carotid arteries
- **Correction**: Expand chest and pinch elbows for compression, not arm pull
- **Recognition**: Pressure feels weak despite arm positioning

- **Error**: Poor bicep and forearm alignment on neck
- **Why It Fails**: Applies pressure to wrong areas, missing carotid targets
- **Correction**: Ensure V-shape alignment with bicep and forearm on neck
- **Recognition**: Opponent resists without significant discomfort

- **Error**: Head positioned too high or away from body
- **Why It Fails**: Allows opponent to create defensive space or frame
- **Correction**: Keep head low and tight to opponent's body for control
- **Recognition**: Opponent easily frames or turns to escape

### Timing Considerations
When to attempt this submission:
- **Optimal Conditions**: When opponent's arms are occupied or extended after control
- **Avoid When**: Opponent maintains strong frames or defensive posture
- **Setup Sequences**: As a primary attack from North-South after establishing control
- **Follow-up Windows**: Must complete within 5-10 seconds to prevent defense or counter

### Prerequisites
Requirements before attempting:
- **Technical Skills**: Understanding of choke mechanics and carotid compression
- **Physical Preparation**: Chest and shoulder strength for pressure application
