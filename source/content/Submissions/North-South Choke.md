## Transition Properties
- **Transition ID**: T901
- **Starting State**: [[North-South]]
- **Ending State**: [[Won by Submission]]
- **Success Probability**: Beginner (40%), Intermediate (65%), Advanced (85%)
- **Execution Complexity**: Medium to High
- **Physical Attributes**: Grip strength (Medium), Chest/shoulder pressure (High)

## Transition Description
The North-South Choke is a powerful head and arm choke executed from the north-south position, where the top player uses their arm and shoulder to compress the opponent's neck, creating a blood choke. This submission is particularly effective because it can be applied with mechanical precision rather than relying on raw strength, making it accessible across weight classes. The North-South Choke combines positional control with a high-percentage submission option, representing one of the most efficient pathways from dominant position to victory.

## Execution Steps
1. From north-south position, slide your non-choking arm under opponent's head
2. Position your choking arm across opponent's neck with your bicep and forearm creating a V-shape
3. Connect your hands in a gable grip or clasp your choking hand around your opposite wrist/forearm
4. Drop your shoulder and chest toward the mat to create downward pressure
5. Keep your head low and tight to opponent's body to prevent defensive space
6. Maintain hip pressure to prevent opponent from turning or bridging
7. Squeeze by expanding your chest and pinching elbows rather than pulling with arms
8. Adjust angle as needed to increase pressure on carotid arteries
9. Maintain control until submission or tap

## Key Grips/Controls
- Bicep/forearm placement against carotid arteries
- Supporting arm under opponent's head
- Gable grip or wrist clasp
- Shoulder/chest pressure
- Hip connection
- Head positioning close to opponent's body
- Elbow alignment for maximum compression

## Common Counters
- [[Frame and Create Space]] → [[North-South Escape]]
- [[Roll to Side]] → [[Side Control Escape]]
- [[Shoulder Walk]] → [[Guard Recovery]]
- [[Hand Fighting]] → [[Defensive Position]]
- [[Bridge and Shrimp]] → [[Half Guard Recovery]]

## Variants
- Traditional North-South Choke (arm under head)
- Modified grip variations (gable, wrist, RNC-style)
- One-arm North-South Choke (Marcelo Garcia style)
- Inverted North-South Choke (from bottom)
- Japanese Necktie (related mechanic with leg involvement)

## Expert Insights
- **Danaher System**: Emphasizes precise mechanical alignment over strength application, focusing on the exact placement of the bicep and forearm to create a perfect V-shape around the neck. Creates systematic approach to breaking down each defensive barrier before applying the finish, with particular attention to head positioning and hip control.
- **Gordon Ryan**: Utilizes the North-South Choke as part of his systematic approach to upper body attacks, often setting it up as a counter to defensive reactions from other threats. Emphasizes maintaining heavy chest pressure throughout the setup to prevent defensive movement before the choke is fully established.
- **Eddie Bravo**: Often employs modified versions of the North-South Choke within the 10th Planet system, particularly connecting it with transitions from the "Truck" position and other unorthodox control positions. Emphasizes using the choke threat to force positional advancement even when the submission isn't completed.

## Timing Considerations
- Apply when opponent's arms are occupied or extended
- Execute after opponent attempts to create frames
- Time with opponent's breathing pattern
- Implement after established solid north-south control
- Use when opponent's defensive focus is elsewhere

## Follow-up Options
- If choke fails, transition to [[Kimura from North-South]]
- If opponent turns, switch to [[Armbar from North-South]]
- If opponent defends strongly, transition to [[Transition to Side Control]]
- If opponent creates space with bridge, switch to [[Transition to Mount]]
- If control is maintained but choke isn't effective, transition to [[Reverse Kimura]]

## Common Errors
- Trying to squeeze with arms only → Ineffective pressure
- Poor bicep/forearm alignment → Pressure on wrong areas
- Head positioned too high → Allowing defensive space
- Rushing the squeeze → Telegraphing the attack
- Failing to maintain hip control → Opponent can create space

## Computer Science Analogy
The North-South Choke represents a high-probability terminal edge in the BJJ state graph, connecting the North-South node directly to the submission victory state. Its application can be modeled as a "constraint satisfaction problem" where multiple control variables (arm position, pressure angle, head placement) must be simultaneously optimized to reach the solution state. The technique creates a decision problem for the defender with a shrinking solution space as controls are properly established.
