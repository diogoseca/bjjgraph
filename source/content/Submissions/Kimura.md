## Transition Description
The Kimura is a powerful shoulder lock that controls the opponent's arm in a figure-four grip, creating rotational pressure on the shoulder joint. Named after Masahiko Kimura, this submission is one of the most versatile in BJJ, available from multiple positions and serving both as a primary submission and as a control mechanism for sweeps, transitions, and other attacks. The Kimura creates a dual-threat system of positional advancement and submission.

## Execution Steps
1. Control opponent's wrist/forearm with same-side grip
2. Thread your other arm under opponent's upper arm near the tricep
3. Connect to a figure-four grip by grabbing your own wrist
4. Establish proper angle relative to opponent's body
5. Create leverage by bringing opponent's hand toward their lower back
6. Keep opponent's elbow tight to their body during control
7. Maintain perpendicular angle to maximize leverage
8. Apply rotational pressure to the shoulder joint
9. Control opponent's body to prevent defensive movement

## Key Grips/Controls
- Figure-four grip on opponent's arm
- Wrist control (primary control point)
- Elbow positioning and control
- Body positioning relative to opponent
- Hip connection to prevent escape
- Head positioning to limit defensive movement

## Common Counters
- [[Roll Through Defense]] → [[Defensive Position]]
- [[Grip Breaking]] → [[Neutral Position]]
- [[Hitchhiker Escape]] → [[Guard Recovery]]
- [[Bridge and Roll]] → [[Top Position]]
- [[Counter Grip]] → [[Kimura Counter]]

## Variants
- Traditional Kimura (from side control)
- Closed guard Kimura
- North-south Kimura
- Reverse Kimura
- Kimura trap system variations
- Standing Kimura

## Expert Insights
- **Danaher System**: Emphasizes the Kimura as a position of control first and submission second. Creates a systematic approach to using the Kimura grip as a control mechanism that forces predictable defensive responses, each countered by a prepared follow-up submission or positional advancement.
- **Gordon Ryan**: Primarily utilizes the Kimura as a control position that leads to back takes and other dominant positions rather than focusing on the submission itself. Emphasizes subtle details in grip configuration that maximize control while minimizing defensive options.
- **Eddie Bravo**: Incorporates the Kimura into the 10th Planet system with unique setups from rubber guard and the "Truck" position. Often uses the threat of the Kimura to force openings for other techniques like the twister or back takes.

## Timing Considerations
- Apply when opponent posts with their arm
- Execute after opponent attempts to frame
- Time with opponent's attempt to escape inferior positions
- Implement as counter to certain guard passes
- Use when opponent is defending other submissions (creating opening)

## Follow-up Options
- If submission fails, transition to [[Back Control]]
- If opponent defends by rolling, follow to [[Mount]]
- If control is strong but submission isn't available, transition to [[Armbar]]
- If opponent creates space, switch to [[Straight Armbar]]
- If opponent turns away, use to sweep to [[Top Position]]

## The Kimura Trap System
The Kimura can be used as the foundation for an entire positional control system:
1. Establish Kimura grip as primary control
2. Use the grip to:
   - Submit directly
   - Control and sweep opponents
   - Force defensive reactions that expose other submissions
   - Create transitions to more dominant positions
3. Maintain the grip through transitions to prevent defensive counters

## Computer Science Analogy
The Kimura represents a versatile edge in the BJJ state graph with connections to multiple states. It functions similar to a "wildcard" in programming - a flexible control mechanism that can adapt to changing conditions. The Kimura grip creates a decision tree for the opponent with branches that all lead to disadvantageous positions, making it a high-value control position beyond its submission potential.
