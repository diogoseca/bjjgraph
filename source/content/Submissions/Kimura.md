## State Machine Content Elements

### Visual Execution Sequence
Detailed step-by-step description for clear movement sequence visualization:

From a dominant position like Side Control or Half Guard Top, or even a defensive position like Closed Guard Bottom, you begin by controlling the opponent's wrist or forearm with your same-side hand, ensuring a firm grip to isolate their arm. Thread your other arm under their upper arm near the tricep, reaching through to connect with a figure-four grip by grabbing your own wrist, locking their arm in a bent position. Establish a perpendicular angle relative to their body to maximize leverage, keeping their elbow tight to their torso to prevent escape, and bring their hand toward their lower back to create initial pressure on the shoulder joint. Apply rotational pressure by lifting their arm or rotating your body, maintaining control of their body to limit defensive movement, and increase the torque on their shoulder through their reactions until they submit due to the intense strain on the joint.

**Template**: "From Side Control or Guard Bottom, control opponent's wrist with same-side grip. Thread other arm under their tricep, connect figure-four grip. Establish perpendicular angle, keep elbow tight, bring hand to lower back. Apply rotational pressure until submission."

### Execution Steps (Numbered Sequence)
1. **Setup Requirements**: Establish position (Side Control, Half Guard Top, or Guard Bottom)
2. **Initial Movement**: Control opponent's wrist/forearm with same-side grip
3. **Opponent Response**: Opponent may attempt to pull arm back or posture
4. **Adaptation**: Thread other arm under opponent's upper arm near tricep
5. **Positioning**: Connect to figure-four grip by grabbing own wrist, establish perpendicular angle
6. **Pressure Application**: Bring opponent's hand toward lower back, keep elbow tight to body
7. **Completion**: Apply rotational pressure to shoulder, control body until submission

### Key Technical Details
Critical elements that determine success:
- **Grip Requirements**: Figure-four grip on opponent's arm for control
- **Base/Foundation**: Stable position for leverage, varies by starting state
- **Timing Windows**: Execute when opponent's arm is posted or exposed
- **Leverage Points**: Rotational pressure on shoulder via arm control
- **Common Adjustments**: Adjust angle and body position based on resistance

### Success Modifiers
Factors that increase/decrease probability:
- **Setup Quality**: Security of wrist control and figure-four grip (+/-20%)
- **Timing Precision**: Executing before opponent retracts arm or defends (+/-15%)
- **Opponent Fatigue**: Reduced defensive mobility over time (+/-5%)
- **Knowledge Test Performance**: Understanding shoulder torque mechanics (+/-10%)
- **Positional Control**: Effectiveness of maintaining perpendicular angle (+/-10%)

## Counter-Attack Analysis

### Common Counters
Opponent responses with success rates:
- **Roll Through Defense**: Rolling through to relieve pressure → [[Defensive Position]] (Success Rate: 25%, Conditions: early reaction)
- **Grip Breaking**: Breaking figure-four grip to escape → [[Neutral Position]] (Success Rate: 20%, Conditions: strong grip defense)
- **Hitchhiker Escape**: Turning thumb down to rotate out → [[Guard Recovery]] (Success Rate: 15%, Conditions: quick adjustment)
- **Bridge and Roll**: Bridging to disrupt position → [[Top Position]] (Success Rate: 10%, Conditions: significant leverage)
- **Counter Grip**: Gripping to counter with own submission → [[Kimura Counter]] (Success Rate: 10%, Conditions: quick anticipation)

Format: `[[Counter Technique]] → [[Result State]] (Success Rate: X%, Conditions: [when applicable])`

### Decision Logic for Opponent Behavior
```
If [kimura setup] is not fully secured:
- Execute [[Roll Through Defense]] (Probability: 25%)

Else if [grip strength] allows breaking control:
- Execute [[Grip Breaking]] (Probability: 20%)

Else if [arm rotation] can be neutralized:
- Execute [[Hitchhiker Escape]] (Probability: 15%)

Else if [body leverage] permits disruption:
- Execute [[Bridge and Roll]] (Probability: 10%)

Else [optimal submission execution]:
- Accept submission (Probability: Success Rate - Modifiers)
```

## Defensive Considerations

### Common Threats During Attempt
Primary risks while attempting this submission:
- **Grip Break**: Opponent breaks figure-four grip → [[Neutral Position]] (Threat Level: Medium)
- **Position Loss**: Opponent escapes arm control during setup → [[Defensive Position]] (Threat Level: Low)
- **Counter Attack**: Opponent counters with roll or own submission → [[Kimura Counter]] (Threat Level: Low)
- **Stalemate**: Opponent retracts arm to stall submission → [[Guard Recovery]] (Threat Level: Medium)

Format: `[[Threat Type]] → [[Resulting Position]] (Threat Level: X)`

### Defensive Strategies
Methods to mitigate threats:
- **Grip Maintenance**: Secure tight figure-four grip quickly to prevent breaks
- **Arm Control**: Maintain wrist and elbow control to avoid escapes
- **Angle Adjustment**: Adjust perpendicular angle to counter arm retraction
- **Body Positioning**: Use body weight to limit rolling or bridging opportunities
- **Adaptation Readiness**: Be prepared to switch to other submissions if defended

## Educational Content

### Expert Insights
Commentary as if from recognized authorities:
- **John Danaher**: "The Kimura is a position of control first and submission second. It forces predictable defensive responses, each countered by a prepared follow-up. It's a systematic approach to dominating through grip."
- **Gordon Ryan**: "I use the Kimura primarily as a control position leading to back takes. Subtle grip details maximize control while minimizing defensive options. It's about strategic positioning over brute force."
- **Eddie Bravo**: "In 10th Planet, the Kimura has unique setups from rubber guard and the Truck. It’s a threat that forces openings for techniques like the twister. Versatility is key in its application."

Each insight should focus on one key technical or strategic element.

### Common Errors
For knowledge test generation:
- **Error**: Insufficient figure-four grip or wrist control
- **Why It Fails**: Allows opponent to pull arm free or break grip
- **Correction**: Ensure tight figure-four grip by grabbing own wrist securely
- **Recognition**: Arm feels loose despite initial control

- **Error**: Poor perpendicular angle during setup
- **Why It Fails**: Reduces leverage for effective shoulder torque
- **Correction**: Position body perpendicular to opponent for optimal angle
- **Recognition**: Pressure feels weak despite proper grip

- **Error**: Inadequate elbow control or body positioning
- **Why It Fails**: Allows opponent to escape or roll out of position
- **Correction**: Keep opponent's elbow tight to body, control their movement
- **Recognition**: Opponent easily moves or rotates out of submission

### Timing Considerations
When to attempt this submission:
- **Optimal Conditions**: When opponent's arm is posted or exposed
- **Avoid When**: Opponent maintains strong arm retraction or grip defense
- **Setup Sequences**: As a counter when opponent frames or escapes

- **Tournament Impact**: Often used as a control mechanism and submission threat

## Safety Considerations
- **Pressure Control**: Apply torque gradually to avoid sudden shoulder damage
- **Partner Awareness**: Monitor opponent's response during application
- **Mat Space**: Ensure adequate space for safe positioning
- **Release Timing**: Release immediately upon tap to prevent injury
- **Shoulder Safety**: Avoid excessive force beyond reasonable torque point

## Submission Integration
**Common Kimura combinations:**
- [[Side Control]] → [[Kimura]] → [[Won by Submission]]
- [[Closed Guard Bottom]] → [[Kimura]] → [[Won by Submission]]
- [[Failed Kimura]] → [[Transition to Armbar]] → [[Armbar]]
