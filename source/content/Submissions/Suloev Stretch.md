## ⚠️ CRITICAL SAFETY NOTICE

**This submission can cause PERMANENT KNEE INJURY including ACL tears requiring surgery.**

- **Injury Risks**: ACL tear (immediate, surgery + 6-12 months recovery), MCL damage, meniscus tears
- **Application Speed**: EXTREMELY SLOW - 5+ seconds minimum. NO sudden pressure EVER.
- **Tap Signals**: Verbal tap is PRIMARY. Physical tap with free hand. ANY discomfort = TAP IMMEDIATELY.
- **Release Protocol**: Release hip pressure immediately, let go of leg gently, move away from knee, check partner's mobility
- **Training Requirement**: ADVANCED ONLY. Not for beginners or intermediates.
- **Never**: Apply with speed, practice on inexperienced partners, ignore tap, continue past mild pressure

**CRITICAL**: Suloev Stretch attacks the knee at a vulnerable angle. Knee ligament tears happen in fractions of a second. TAP EARLY. There is NO toughness test here - only permanent injury or intelligence. Your training partner is trusting you with their ability to walk normally.

## Overview

The Suloev Stretch is an extremely dangerous inverted leg lock that attacks the knee from the [[Turtle Position]]. Named after Russian fighter Amar Suloev, this submission creates severe torque on the knee joint, particularly targeting the ACL and MCL.

This technique is included for completeness but should be practiced with EXTREME caution or not at all in most training environments. Many high-level grapplers consider this technique too dangerous for regular training.

**Success Rates**: Beginner N/A (forbidden), Intermediate 40% (supervised only), Advanced 60%

**WARNING**: This is one of the most dangerous submissions in BJJ. Practice only under expert supervision with experienced partners who understand knee injury risks.
