## ⚠️ SAFETY NOTICE
**Blood choke variations. Apply SLOWLY over 3-5 seconds. RELEASE upon tap.**

## Overview
Darce Variations include multiple setups and finishing positions for the D'arce choke system: standard D'arce, no-gi D'arce, rolling D'arce, mounted D'arce, and standing D'arce.

**Success Rates**: Beginner 20%, Intermediate 40%, Advanced 65%

## Common Variations

### Standard D'arce
- From front headlock or turtle
- Thread arm under near arm
- Hand to bicep grip
- Squeeze with shoulder pressure

### Rolling D'arce  
- Dynamic roll to finish
- Maintains tight grip through rotation
- Finishes on side or back

### Mounted D'arce
- Applied from mount position
- Requires deep threading
- High finishing percentage

### No-Gi D'arce
- Modified grip (gable or RNC grip)
- Relies more on shoulder seal
- Popular in submission grappling

## Execution Steps
1. Identify D'arce opportunity (arm exposed)
2. Thread arm under near arm toward far armpit
3. Secure grip (bicep, wrist, or gable)
4. Create shoulder seal on carotid side
5. Progressive squeeze 3-5 seconds
6. RELEASE immediately upon tap

*Position before pressure. Safety above all.*
