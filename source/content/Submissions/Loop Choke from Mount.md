# Loop Choke from Mount

## ⚠️ SAFETY NOTICE
Blood choke from dominant position. Apply slowly. Release immediately upon tap.

## Overview
Loop choke variation applied from mount position, using deep collar grip and rolling motion to finish the choke while transitioning position.

## Execution Steps
1. Establish mount control
2. Feed hand deep into collar (same side)
3. Opponent turns head (defensive reaction)
4. Dismount to side of choke
5. Roll opponent while maintaining grip
6. Their shoulder + your grip = choke
7. Release upon tap

## Key Details
- **Setup**: When opponent turns head away from collar grip
- **Dismount**: Critical to create rolling angle
- **Finish**: Can finish in various positions (side, technical mount, back)
- **Pressure**: Combination of collar grip and their shoulder

## Expert Insights
