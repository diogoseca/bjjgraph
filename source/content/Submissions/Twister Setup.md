## Technique Description
The Twister Setup is a specialized submission pathway that creates the conditions necessary to establish the powerful spinal lock known as the Twister. Developed and popularized by Eddie Bravo within his 10th Planet Jiu-Jitsu system, this setup involves a precise sequence of limb entanglements and control points that transition from more common positions to the unique configuration required for the Twister submission. Unlike direct submissions that attack immediately available limbs, the Twister Setup requires methodical positional advancement, strategically restricting the opponent's mobility while creating the specific body alignment necessary for the submission. The setup phase is characterized by controlling the opponent's lower body with a leg triangle while simultaneously working to thread an arm under their neck, establishing perpendicular control of their upper body relative to their hips. The Twister Setup represents one of the most technically sophisticated transition sequences in BJJ, requiring precise understanding of body mechanics and control principles rather than pure strength or athleticism.

## Execution Steps
1. Begin from [[Truck Position]] (most common), [[Back Control]], or occasionally from [[Side Control]]
2. If starting from Truck Position, secure your legs in triangle configuration around the opponent's trapped leg
3. Establish hip-to-hip connection with the opponent, aligning your body perpendicular to theirs
4. Use your inside arm (arm closest to opponent's head) to reach under their neck
5. Secure the opponent's far arm by grabbing their wrist or establishing an underhooking grip
6. Lock your legs tightly around the opponent's trapped leg, preventing hip mobility
7. Drive your hips toward the opponent's head while pulling their upper body toward their trapped leg
8. Create the "twisting" alignment by ensuring the opponent's shoulders are perpendicular to their hips
9. Establish the full [[Twister Control]] position with proper neck and leg control

## Key Details
- **Leg Triangle Configuration**: Must create complete control of opponent's trapped leg
- **Hip Positioning**: Maintain perpendicular alignment to opponent's body
- **Far Arm Control**: Essential to prevent defensive framing and mobility
- **Head Positioning**: Keep your head tight to opponent's upper back/shoulder
- **Neck Threading**: Arm must fully thread under neck with proper depth
- **Hip Drive**: Continuous hip pressure creates the spinal pressure mechanism
- **Body Alignment**: Opponent's shoulders must be perpendicular to their hips
- **Grip Sequence**: Establish neck control before finalizing leg position

## Common Defenses
- [[Spinal Alignment]] → [[Twister Prevention]]
- [[Hip Escape]] → [[Truck Defense]]
- [[Wrist Control]] → [[Grip Fighting]]
- [[Roll to Knees]] → [[Turtle Position]]
- [[Leg Extension]] → [[Leg Entanglement Escape]]

## Counter Techniques
- [[Hip Drive Escape]] - Opponent bridges strongly to create space
- [[Preventative Framing]] - Opponent establishes defensive frames early
- [[Roll Through Counter]] - Opponent rolls in the direction of the twist
- [[Far Side Control]] - Opponent fights for control of their trapped side
- [[Leg Triangle Disruption]] - Opponent attacks your leg triangle control
- [[Spinal Alignment Maintenance]] - Opponent keeps spine neutrally aligned

## Variations
- Back Control Twister Setup - Entering from standard back control
- Side Control Twister Entry - Rare variation from side control
- Honey Hole to Twister - Transitioning from leg entanglement to Twister
- Rolling Twister Setup - Dynamic variation with rolling entry
- Modified Truck Twister - Setup with modified leg configuration
- Twister Side Control - Alternative control configuration during setup

## Setup Opportunities
- [[Truck Position]] → [[Twister Setup]]
- [[Back Control]] → [[Twister Setup]]
- [[Failed Calf Slicer]] → [[Twister Setup]]
- [[Defended Banana Split]] → [[Twister Setup]]
- [[Side Control Far Arm Control]] → [[Twister Setup]]
- [[Rolling Back Attack]] → [[Twister Setup]]

## Follow-up Options
- [[Twister Control]] → [[Twister Finish]] (primary objective)
- [[Transition to Calf Slicer]] (if opponent defends twister)
- [[Return to Truck]] (if position is compromised)
- [[Banana Split Switch]] (alternative submission)
- [[Back Control Recovery]] (if upper body control is lost)
- [[Armbar from Twister]] (attacking extended arm)

## Expert Insights
- **Danaher System**: While not a primary focus in the Danaher submission system due to its illegality in certain competition rulesets, Danaher acknowledges the mechanical efficiency of the position. When discussing the Twister, he emphasizes understanding the precise control mechanics that make the submission effective, particularly the relationship between controlling the shoulders perpendicular to the hips while preventing defensive mobility. He views proper setup as more critical than the finishing mechanics.
- **Gordon Ryan**: Recognizes the Twister as a specialized submission that requires specific setups and typically employs it selectively within his competition strategy. Ryan emphasizes establishing complete control of the opponent's defensive options before initiating the setup sequence, focusing on eliminating escape routes methodically rather than rushing to the submission position.
- **Eddie Bravo**: As the primary developer and proponent of the Twister in BJJ (adapted from wrestling's guillotine), Bravo has created a comprehensive system for entering the position from various scenarios. He particularly emphasizes the Truck Position as the optimal entry pathway, creating a systematic approach that links multiple 10th Planet-specific positions into an integrated attacking sequence. Bravo's approach focuses on controlling the opponent's hip mobility throughout the setup phase.

## Common Errors
- Insufficient leg control → Opponent can escape trapped leg
- Poor perpendicular alignment → Ineffective twisting mechanics
- Rushed neck threading → Defensive space creation
- Inadequate far arm control → Defensive framing opportunity
- Improper hip positioning → Reduced leverage
- Telegraphing submission intention → Early defensive reaction
- Excessive strength application → Energy depletion

## Strategic Application
- Creating submission threat from specialized control positions
- Exploiting opponent's defensive focus on more common submissions
- Generating powerful submissions in no-gi and MMA contexts
- Establishing control against explosive or flexible opponents
- Creating decision points that force defensive errors
- Connecting 10th Planet-specific positions in tactical sequence
- Setting up alternative submissions through positional advancement

## Training Approaches
- Isolated drilling of specific control transitions
- Slow-motion progression through setup stages
- Position-specific sparring from Truck Position
- Defensive recognition against common counters
- Control maintenance under increasing resistance
- Connected drilling linking Truck, Twister, and alternative submissions

## Competition Effectiveness
The Twister Setup has proven to be highly effective in submission-only competitions, particularly in no-gi and MMA formats where the submission is legal. While less common than more traditional submissions, the Twister has been successfully applied at the highest levels of competition, most notably by Chan Sung Jung (Korean Zombie) in the UFC. Analysis of competition data indicates the setup is most successful when initiated from the Truck Position, with approximately 70% of competitive Twister submissions coming from this entry pathway. The setup's effectiveness comes partly from its relative unfamiliarity to many practitioners, creating defensive hesitation during the critical transition phases. In grappling competitions where the technique is legal, practitioners specifically trained in the 10th Planet system demonstrate significantly higher success rates with the setup due to their systematic approach to the position.

## Historical Development
The Twister submission and its setup methodology were adapted from wrestling (where it's known as a guillotine) by Eddie Bravo and incorporated into his 10th Planet Jiu-Jitsu system in the early 2000s. While initially viewed as an exotic or novelty technique, it gained mainstream recognition after appearing in high-profile MMA competitions. The setup methodology has evolved significantly since its introduction to BJJ, with Bravo and his students developing increasingly refined entry systems, particularly focusing on the Truck Position as the primary gateway to the submission. The most significant evolution has been the development of branching submission threats that complement the Twister, creating decision trees that force opponents to choose between multiple high-percentage submission risks. Modern application of the Twister Setup represents a sophisticated positional approach rather than the isolated technique it was initially perceived to be, demonstrating how BJJ continuously refines and systematizes even its most specialized techniques.

## Conceptual Relationship to Computer Science
The Twister Setup functions similar to a "forced directed graph traversal" in computer science, where the initiator systematically eliminates potential escape paths while directing the opponent toward a predetermined end state. This represents a form of "constrained optimization problem" where the setup systematically reduces degrees of freedom until only the desired outcome remains possible. The setup also demonstrates principles of "deadlock detection and resolution" from concurrent programming, where control points are established in a specific sequence to prevent the defensive system from reaching safe states. Just as certain algorithms can force a system into a particular configuration by progressively eliminating alternative pathways, the Twister Setup methodically restricts defensive options until the opponent's body is forced into the precise alignment required for the submission to be applied effectively.
