## State Machine Content Elements

### Visual Execution Sequence
Detailed step-by-step description for clear movement sequence visualization:

Begin from a control position such as the Truck Position, Back Control, or occasionally Side Control, with the most common entry being from the Truck Position where your legs are already in a triangle configuration around the opponent's trapped leg. Establish a hip-to-hip connection with the opponent, aligning your body perpendicular to theirs to create the necessary angle for the Twister. Use your inside arm, closest to the opponent's head, to reach under their neck, threading it deeply to prepare for upper body control. Secure the opponent's far arm by grabbing their wrist or establishing an underhooking grip, preventing defensive framing, and lock your legs tightly around their trapped leg to restrict hip mobility. Drive your hips toward the opponent's head while pulling their upper body toward their trapped leg, creating the "twisting" alignment by ensuring their shoulders are perpendicular to their hips, thus establishing the full Twister Control position ready for the finishing submission.

**Template**: "From Truck Position or similar, secure leg triangle. Align perpendicular, hip-to-hip with opponent. Thread arm under neck, control far arm. Lock legs around trapped leg, drive hips to head, pull upper body to leg for twisting alignment into Twister Control."

### Execution Steps (Numbered Sequence)
1. **Setup Requirements**: Begin from [[Truck Position]], [[Back Control]], or [[Side Control]]
2. **Initial Movement**: Secure legs in triangle configuration around opponent's trapped leg if from Truck
3. **Opponent Response**: Opponent may attempt to escape hip control or frame defensively
4. **Adaptation**: Establish hip-to-hip connection, align body perpendicular to opponent
5. **Positioning**: Thread inside arm under opponent's neck, secure far arm with grip or underhook
6. **Pressure Application**: Lock legs tightly around trapped leg, drive hips toward head
7. **Completion**: Pull upper body toward trapped leg, align shoulders perpendicular to hips for [[Twister Control]]

### Key Technical Details
Critical elements that determine success:
- **Grip Requirements**: Control of far arm to prevent defensive framing
- **Base/Foundation**: Leg triangle configuration for trapped leg control
- **Timing Windows**: Execute when opponent's defensive mobility is restricted
- **Leverage Points**: Hip drive and perpendicular alignment for twisting setup
- **Common Adjustments**: Adjust arm threading and leg lock based on defensive reactions

### Success Modifiers
Factors that increase/decrease probability:
- **Setup Quality**: Security of leg triangle and arm threading (+/-20%)
- **Timing Precision**: Executing during opponent's mobility restriction (+/-15%)
- **Opponent Fatigue**: Reduced defensive resistance over time (+/-5%)
- **Knowledge Test Performance**: Understanding Twister mechanics (+/-10%)
- **Positional Control**: Effectiveness of hip-to-hip connection and alignment (+/-10%)

## Counter-Attack Analysis

### Common Counters
Opponent responses with success rates:
- **Spinal Alignment**: Maintaining neutral spine to prevent twisting → [[Twister Prevention]] (Success Rate: 25%, Conditions: early reaction)
- **Hip Escape**: Escaping hip control to regain mobility → [[Truck Defense]] (Success Rate: 20%, Conditions: strong movement)
- **Wrist Control**: Fighting for control of gripped arm → [[Grip Fighting]] (Success Rate: 15%, Conditions: quick adjustment)
- **Roll to Knees**: Rolling to turtle to escape setup → [[Turtle Position]] (Success Rate: 10%, Conditions: significant leverage)
- **Leg Extension**: Extending trapped leg to disrupt control → [[Leg Entanglement Escape]] (Success Rate: 10%, Conditions: immediate action)

Format: `[[Counter Technique]] → [[Result State]] (Success Rate: X%, Conditions: [when applicable])`

### Decision Logic for Opponent Behavior
```
If [twister setup] is not fully secured:
- Execute [[Spinal Alignment]] (Probability: 25%)

Else if [hip escape] can regain mobility:
- Execute [[Hip Escape]] (Probability: 20%)

Else if [wrist control] disrupts grip:
- Execute [[Wrist Control]] (Probability: 15%)

Else if [roll to knees] escapes setup:
- Execute [[Roll to Knees]] (Probability: 10%)

Else [optimal setup execution]:
- Accept transition to [[Twister Control]] (Probability: Success Rate - Modifiers)
```

## Defensive Considerations

### Common Threats During Attempt
Primary risks while attempting this setup:
- **Spinal Defense**: Opponent aligns spine to prevent twisting → [[Twister Prevention]] (Threat Level: Medium)
- **Hip Mobility**: Opponent escapes hip control → [[Truck Defense]] (Threat Level: Medium)
- **Grip Fighting**: Opponent fights for wrist control → [[Grip Fighting]] (Threat Level: Low)
- **Positional Escape**: Opponent rolls to knees or other position → [[Turtle Position]] (Threat Level: Low)

Format: `[[Threat Type]] → [[Resulting Position]] (Threat Level: X)`

### Defensive Strategies
Methods to mitigate threats:
- **Leg Control**: Maintain tight leg triangle to prevent hip escape
- **Arm Threading**: Secure deep arm position under neck to counter spinal alignment
- **Far Arm Grip**: Keep strong control of far arm to block grip fighting
- **Hip Pressure**: Drive hips continuously to limit opponent's mobility
- **Adaptation Readiness**: Be prepared to switch to alternative submissions or controls if setup fails

## Educational Content

### Expert Insights
Commentary as if from recognized authorities:
- **John Danaher**: "While not central to my system due to competition rules, the Twister Setup demonstrates mechanical efficiency. Proper control mechanics, especially shoulder-to-hip alignment, are more critical than the finish itself."
- **Gordon Ryan**: "The Twister Setup is a specialized entry that requires eliminating escape routes methodically. I focus on complete control of defensive options before advancing to the submission position."
- **Eddie Bravo**: "The Twister Setup is a cornerstone of the 10th Planet system, with the Truck Position as the optimal entry. It’s about linking control positions systematically to force the opponent into the Twister alignment."

Each insight should focus on one key technical or strategic element.

### Common Errors
For knowledge test generation:
- **Error**: Insufficient leg control in triangle configuration
- **Why It Fails**: Allows opponent to escape trapped leg and regain mobility
- **Correction**: Ensure legs are locked tightly around opponent's trapped leg
- **Recognition**: Opponent easily extends leg or escapes hip control

- **Error**: Poor perpendicular alignment with opponent
- **Why It Fails**: Reduces effectiveness of twisting mechanics for Twister Control
- **Correction**: Maintain hip-to-hip connection and perpendicular body alignment
- **Recognition**: Difficulty establishing shoulder-to-hip twisting alignment

- **Error**: Rushed or shallow neck threading
- **Why It Fails**: Creates
