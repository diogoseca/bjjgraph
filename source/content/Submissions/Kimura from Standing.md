## ⚠️ SAFETY NOTICE
**Standing shoulder lock with takedown coordination required. EXTREMELY HIGH injury risk if applied while both standing. Apply slowly and coordinate safe landing.**

## Overview
Kimura from Standing is advanced technique combining standup control, shoulder lock, and controlled takedown. Typically used to force opponent to ground where finish is safer and more controlled. Can finish standing in competition but training requires extreme caution.

## Execution Steps
1. **Grip Establishment**: Isolate arm in standing position
2. **Figure-Four**: Secure kimura grip while standing
3. **Takedown Coordination**: Use grip to control descent to ground
4. **Ground Transition**: Complete takedown safely
5. **Finish or Control**: Complete submission on ground or use for control

## Critical Safety
- **NEVER finish while both standing** (extremely high dislocation risk)
- **Coordinate takedown** with shoulder lock
- **Verbal tap PRIMARY** (partner may be unable to tap physically)
- **Controlled descent** essential to prevent injury
- **Training**: Take to ground first, then finish

## Expert Note
**This technique should typically be used as a takedown/control method rather than a standing finish. Finishing while standing carries VERY HIGH injury risk and should only be attempted in competition by advanced practitioners with excellent control.**
