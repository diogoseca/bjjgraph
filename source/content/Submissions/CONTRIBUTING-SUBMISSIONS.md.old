- **Opponent Vulnerability**: Conditions that make submission viable
- **Technical Skill Level**: Minimum experience recommended for safety

## State Machine Content Elements

### Visual Finishing Sequence
Detailed description for technical completion:
- Final positioning and body mechanics
- Pressure application and target anatomy
- Opponent's physical response and submission signals
- Moment of technical completion and position consolidation

**Template**: "With [specific grip/position], you apply [pressure type] to [target area]. Your opponent [physical response], [submission signal], and [completion moment]."

### Setup Requirements (Pre-Submission Checklist)
Conditions that must be satisfied before attempting:
1. **Position Establishment**: Dominant position must be secured
2. **Control Points**: Specific body parts under control
3. **Angle Creation**: Proper leverage positioning
4. **Grip Acquisition**: Required hand/arm positioning
5. **Space Elimination**: Removing opponent's defensive options
6. **Timing Recognition**: Optimal moment for execution

### Execution Steps (Finishing Sequence)
1. **Initial Grip**: First control point establishment
2. **Position Adjustment**: Fine-tuning angle and leverage
3. **Pressure Application**: Beginning of submission mechanics
4. **Progressive Tightening**: Incremental increase in pressure
5. **Final Adjustment**: Last technical detail for completion
6. **Submission Recognition**: Identifying opponent's tap or completion

### Anatomical Targeting
Precise technical details for educational accuracy:
- **Primary Target**: Main anatomical structure affected
- **Secondary Effects**: Additional pressure points involved
- **Pressure Direction**: Vector and angle of force application
- **Safety Considerations**: Risk factors and injury prevention
- **Physiological Response**: Body's reaction to the technique

## Opponent Defense Patterns

### Common Escape Attempts
Defensive responses with success rates:
- **Early Defense**: Prevention before submission is locked (+60% escape rate)
- **Hand Fighting**: Grip breaking and frame creation (+40% escape rate)
- **Position Scramble**: Explosive movement to change position (+30% escape rate)
- **Technical Escape**: Specific counter-technique (+25% escape rate)
- **Tap Decision**: Recognition of inevitable submission (0% escape rate)

Format: `[[Defense Technique]] â†’ [[Outcome]] (Success Rate: X%, Window: [time available])`

### Defensive Decision Logic
```
If [submission setup] < 70% complete:
- Execute [[Early Defense]] (Success Rate: 60%)

Else if [grip established] but [pressure not applied]:
- Execute [[Hand Fighting]] (Success Rate: 40%)

Else if [submission locked] but [escape window exists]:
- Execute [[Technical Escape]] (Success Rate: 25%)

Else [submission inevitable]:
- Execute [[Tap Out]] (Immediate end to prevent injury)
```

### Resistance Patterns
How opponent fights the submission:
- **Strength-Based**: Using power to resist pressure
- **Technical**: Specific counters and escapes
- **Positional**: Changing angles to reduce effectiveness
- **Time-Based**: Stalling to create opportunities
