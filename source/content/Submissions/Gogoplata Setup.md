## State Machine Content Elements

### Visual Execution Sequence
Detailed step-by-step description for clear movement sequence visualization:

Begin from an established Rubber Guard control position such as New York Control or Williams Guard, where your hips are elevated and your opponent's posture is broken down with one of their arms trapped and controlled by your grip. Your legs are actively working to maintain the high guard position, with one leg potentially controlling their shoulder or arm while creating sufficient space near their neck. Slowly slide your shin across the front of the opponent's throat, positioning it perpendicular to their neck with the blade of your shin making contact, ensuring you're targeting the trachea area rather than sliding too high onto the jaw or too low onto the chest. Your foot begins to thread behind the opponent's head, your toes pointing down as you guide your heel toward the back of their skull, establishing the characteristic "shin across throat" position. As the shin settles into position, you pull down on their head or arm with your grips while simultaneously applying pressure through your shin, your other leg often hooking or pushing against their body to maintain control and prevent their escape. The opponent feels increasing pressure across their windpipe as you tighten your configuration, their defensive space closing as the choke locks in and forces the submission.

**Template**: "From Rubber Guard control, elevate hips and break posture with arm trapped. Slide shin across throat perpendicular to neck. Thread foot behind head, toes down toward back of skull. Pull head/arm down, apply shin pressure while controlling with other leg. Opponent feels windpipe pressure closing defensive space until submission."

## ⚠️ Safety Considerations

### Injury Risks
Gogoplata setups and submissions can cause serious injuries if applied incorrectly:
- **Trachea Crush/Windpipe Damage** (Severity: Critical, Recovery: weeks to months; shin pressure on throat)
- **Loss of Consciousness** (Severity: High, Recovery: immediate to hours; rare but possible from air choke)
- **Cervical Spine Injury** (Severity: High, Recovery: weeks to months; from neck hyperextension during setup)
- **Jaw/TMJ Injury** (Severity: Medium, Recovery: 2-4 weeks; from improper shin placement on jaw)

### Application Speed
- Apply submissions SLOWLY and progressively over 5-7 seconds minimum (slower than other chokes)
- Never drive shin forcefully or suddenly across throat area
- Gradually position shin to allow partner awareness of airway restriction
- Maintain constant awareness of partner's tap signals, especially verbal taps

### Tap Signals
Partners must establish clear tap signals before training:
- **Verbal Tap**: Saying "tap" loudly (CRITICAL - arms often trapped in rubber guard variations)
- **Physical Tap**: Tapping partner's body, mat, or own body with any free limb (minimum 2 taps)
- **Emergency Signal**: Any vocalization or body movement indicating distress if fully trapped

### Release Protocol
When partner taps:
1. Immediately remove shin pressure from throat/neck area
2. Release rubber guard or wrist control to free partner's arms
3. Carefully extract shin from partner's neck without scraping
4. Check partner's breathing and throat comfort: "Can you breathe okay? Throat alright?"
5. Observe for coughing, difficulty swallowing, or voice changes
6. Monitor for 20-30 seconds to ensure airway is unobstructed

### Training Progression
- **Weeks 1-4**: Rubber guard positions only (New York, Williams Guard), no shin placement
- **Weeks 5-8**: Slow shin positioning drills with cooperative partner (5% speed, tap to position only)
- **Weeks 9-12**: Very light throat contact with zero pressure (20% speed, immediate tap to contact)
- **Weeks 13-16**: Minimal pressure application with experienced partner (40% speed, tap at 20% pressure)
- **Ongoing**: Advanced practitioners only, never full pressure in training, extreme caution always

### Partner Communication
- Establish multiple tap signals before drilling, emphasize verbal tap as primary
- Communicate throat comfort continuously: "pressure okay?" "can you breathe?"
- Discuss partner's trachea sensitivity or previous neck/throat injuries
- Agree on absolute maximum pressure for drilling (typically 20-40% maximum, never full)
- Watch for any signs of breathing difficulty - release immediately at first sign of distress
- Consider this an advanced technique requiring mutual trust and experience

Begin from an established control position such as New York Control or Williams Guard within the Rubber Guard system, where you have already secured a strong wrist or arm control with one hand to prevent the opponent's defensive framing. Adjust your hip position slightly to create the necessary space for shin insertion, maintaining a tight connection to avoid losing control. Start sliding your shin across the opponent's neck or throat region, ensuring it is positioned directly against the throat rather than the jawline or collarbone for maximum effectiveness. Guide your foot behind the opponent's head or neck, applying light pressure to secure it in place, and adjust your grip to optimize leverage on the opponent's wrist or arm. Finalize the shin position directly across the throat, eliminating any defensive space by stabilizing your position, thus transitioning into the active Gogoplata Control ready for the finishing submission.

**Template**: "From New York Control or Williams Guard, secure wrist control. Adjust hips for space, slide shin across throat. Guide foot behind head, secure with pressure. Optimize grip, finalize shin position across throat for Gogoplata Control."

## Execution Steps

**EXTREME SAFETY WARNING**: Gogoplata targets the trachea/windpipe - VERY HIGH injury risk. Apply pressure SLOWLY over 5-7 seconds minimum. This is an ADVANCED technique requiring extensive flexibility and extreme caution.

### Step-by-Step Execution

### Step 1: Rubber Guard Control Establishment (Setup Phase)
Begin from New York Control or Williams Guard with your hips elevated and opponent's posture broken, securing strong wrist or arm control.
- Your guard is high on their back/shoulders
- One hand controls their wrist to prevent defensive framing
- Their posture should be broken forward
- Safety check: Establish tap signals (VERBAL tap is critical - arms often trapped)

### Step 2: Hip Adjustment for Shin Entry (Preparation Phase)
Adjust your hip position slightly to create the necessary angle and space for shin insertion while maintaining tight connection.
- Subtle hip shift creates space without losing control
- Keep opponent's weight forward and down
- Maintain wrist control throughout adjustment
- Partner check: Confirm they understand this is a controlled drill

### Step 3: Shin Sliding Initiation (Entry Phase - SLOW MOTION)
Begin sliding your shin across the opponent's neck/throat region VERY SLOWLY, targeting the throat rather than jawline or collarbone.
- Move shin deliberately, not suddenly
- Blade of shin should contact throat area
- Ensure shin is perpendicular to their neck
- Speed: EXTREMELY SLOW - give partner time to tap to position
- Watch for: Any discomfort, coughing, or distress signals

### Step 4: Foot Threading Behind Head (Positioning Phase)
Guide your foot behind the opponent's head or neck, threading it carefully while applying only minimal pressure to secure position.
- Toes point downward toward back of their skull
- Heel moves toward the back of their head
- NO PRESSURE yet - positioning only
- Monitor: Partner's breathing and any signs of airway restriction

### Step 5: Grip Optimization and Shin Finalization (Lock Phase)
Adjust your wrist/arm control grip to optimize leverage while finalizing shin position directly across the throat.
- Shin should be centered on their trachea (throat)
- Your grip prevents any defensive framing
- Position is locked but pressure minimal
- Critical: Constant verbal check-ins: "Okay?" "Can you breathe?"

### Step 6: Stabilization for Gogoplata Control (Completion Phase - MINIMAL PRESSURE ONLY)
Eliminate defensive space by stabilizing your position, transitioning into Gogoplata Control ready for the finishing submission.
- Your body position is locked and stable
- Opponent has limited escape options
- **IN TRAINING**: Apply ZERO to minimal pressure (10-20% max)
- **FEEL FOR TAP**: Verbal "tap", hand tapping, ANY distress signal
- **RELEASE IMMEDIATELY**:
  - Remove shin from throat instantly
  - Open rubber guard to free their arms
  - Carefully extract shin without scraping
  - Check partner: "Throat okay? Can you breathe normally? Any pain?"
- Post-setup: Monitor for coughing, voice changes, difficulty swallowing
- Watch for: Delayed reactions - throat injuries can manifest minutes later

**Total Execution Time in Training**: 5-7 seconds MINIMUM for each phase. In drilling, stop at position achievement with ZERO pressure. This technique should only be practiced by advanced students with extensive flexibility training and under expert supervision.

### Key Technical Details
Critical elements that determine success:
- **Grip Requirements**: Constant control of opponent's arm to prevent defensive frames
- **Base/Foundation**: Hip mobility and angle for effective shin placement
- **Timing Windows**: Execute when opponent's attention is divided or posture is broken
- **Leverage Points**: Shin directly across throat for choking setup
- **Common Adjustments**: Adjust hip angle and shin insertion based on defensive reactions

### Success Modifiers
Factors that increase/decrease probability:
- **Setup Quality**: Security of wrist control and shin placement (+/-20%)
- **Timing Precision**: Executing during opponent's divided attention (+/-15%)
- **Opponent Fatigue**: Reduced defensive resistance over time (+/-5%)
- **Knowledge Test Performance**: Understanding Gogoplata mechanics (+/-10%)
- **Positional Control**: Effectiveness of hip adjustment and space management (+/-10%)

## Counter-Attack Analysis

### Common Counters
Opponent responses with success rates:
- **Posture Defense**: Posturing up to prevent shin placement → [[Control Escape]] (Success Rate: 25%, Conditions: early reaction)
- **Arm Frame**: Framing with arms to create space → [[Space Creation]] (Success Rate: 20%, Conditions: strong defense)
- **Head Pull Back**: Pulling head back to avoid shin → [[Setup Prevention]] (Success Rate: 15%, Conditions: quick adjustment)
- **Forward Pressure**: Driving forward to flatten guard → [[Guard Flattening]] (Success Rate: 10%, Conditions: significant leverage)
- **Hand Fighting**: Fighting grips to break control → [[Grip Breaking]] (Success Rate: 10%, Conditions: immediate action)

Format: `[[Counter Technique]] → [[Result State]] (Success Rate: X%, Conditions: [when applicable])`

### Decision Logic for Opponent Behavior
```
If [gogoplata setup] is not fully secured:
- Execute [[Posture Defense]] (Probability: 25%)

Else if [arm frame] can create space:
- Execute [[Arm Frame]] (Probability: 20%)

Else if [head pull back] avoids shin:
- Execute [[Head Pull Back]] (Probability: 15%)

Else if [forward pressure] flattens guard:
- Execute [[Forward Pressure]] (Probability: 10%)

Else [optimal setup execution]:
- Accept transition to [[Gogoplata Control]] (Probability: Success Rate - Modifiers)
```

## Defensive Considerations

### Common Threats During Attempt
Primary risks while attempting this setup:
- **Posture Defense**: Opponent postures up to prevent shin placement → [[Control Escape]] (Threat Level: Medium)
- **Space Creation**: Opponent frames to create defensive space → [[Space Creation]] (Threat Level: Medium)
- **Setup Prevention**: Opponent pulls head back to avoid shin → [[Setup Prevention]] (Threat Level: Low)
- **Guard Flattening**: Opponent drives forward to flatten guard → [[Guard Flattening]] (Threat Level: Low)

Format: `[[Threat Type]] → [[Resulting Position]] (Threat Level: X)`

### Defensive Strategies
Methods to mitigate threats:
- **Wrist Control**: Maintain tight grip on wrist to prevent framing
- **Hip Mobility**: Adjust hips to counter posture defense and maintain angle
- **Shin Insertion**: Slide shin quickly and precisely to avoid head pull-back
- **Space Management**: Minimize space to block forward pressure
- **Adaptation Readiness**: Be prepared to switch to other submissions or controls if setup fails

## Educational Content

### Expert Insights
Commentary as if from recognized authorities:
- **John Danaher**: "While not a primary focus in my system, the Gogoplata Setup showcases mechanical principles of control. Incremental establishment of control points before committing to the final position is key."
- **Gordon Ryan**: "The Gogoplata Setup is a specialized attack with critical vulnerability during transition. Defensive awareness at this stage can nullify the attack before it’s established."
- **Eddie Bravo**: "The Gogoplata Setup is central to the 10th Planet system, with subtle details like the 'shin fade' technique to disguise the attack. It’s the most technically demanding part of the sequence."

Each insight should focus on one key technical or strategic element.

### Common Errors
For knowledge test generation:
- **Error**: Insufficient flexibility for shin placement
- **Why It Fails**: Prevents proper positioning of shin across throat
- **Correction**: Develop hip flexibility specific to Gogoplata mechanics
- **Recognition**: Difficulty sliding shin into position without losing control

- **Error**: Premature loss of wrist control
- **Why It Fails**: Allows opponent to frame defensively and escape setup
- **Correction**: Maintain constant grip on opponent's wrist or arm
- **Recognition**: Opponent easily creates space or breaks control

- **Error**: Incorrect shin angle or placement
- **Why It Fails**: Reduces effectiveness of choking mechanism
- **Correction**: Position shin directly across throat, not jawline or collarbone
- **Recognition**: Shin slips or fails to apply pressure correctly
