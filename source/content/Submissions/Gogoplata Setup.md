## State Machine Content Elements

### Visual Execution Sequence
Detailed step-by-step description for clear movement sequence visualization:

Begin from an established control position such as New York Control or Williams Guard within the Rubber Guard system, where you have already secured a strong wrist or arm control with one hand to prevent the opponent's defensive framing. Adjust your hip position slightly to create the necessary space for shin insertion, maintaining a tight connection to avoid losing control. Start sliding your shin across the opponent's neck or throat region, ensuring it is positioned directly against the throat rather than the jawline or collarbone for maximum effectiveness. Guide your foot behind the opponent's head or neck, applying light pressure to secure it in place, and adjust your grip to optimize leverage on the opponent's wrist or arm. Finalize the shin position directly across the throat, eliminating any defensive space by stabilizing your position, thus transitioning into the active Gogoplata Control ready for the finishing submission.

**Template**: "From New York Control or Williams Guard, secure wrist control. Adjust hips for space, slide shin across throat. Guide foot behind head, secure with pressure. Optimize grip, finalize shin position across throat for Gogoplata Control."

### Execution Steps (Numbered Sequence)
1. **Setup Requirements**: Begin from [[New York Control]] or [[Williams Guard]]
2. **Initial Movement**: Maintain strong wrist/arm control with one hand
3. **Opponent Response**: Opponent may attempt to posture up or frame defensively
4. **Adaptation**: Create space by adjusting hip position and angle slightly
5. **Positioning**: Slide shin across opponent's neck/throat, guide foot behind head
6. **Pressure Application**: Secure foot with light pressure, adjust grip for leverage
7. **Completion**: Finalize shin position across throat, stabilize for [[Gogoplata Control]]

### Key Technical Details
Critical elements that determine success:
- **Grip Requirements**: Constant control of opponent's arm to prevent defensive frames
- **Base/Foundation**: Hip mobility and angle for effective shin placement
- **Timing Windows**: Execute when opponent's attention is divided or posture is broken
- **Leverage Points**: Shin directly across throat for choking setup
- **Common Adjustments**: Adjust hip angle and shin insertion based on defensive reactions

### Success Modifiers
Factors that increase/decrease probability:
- **Setup Quality**: Security of wrist control and shin placement (+/-20%)
- **Timing Precision**: Executing during opponent's divided attention (+/-15%)
- **Opponent Fatigue**: Reduced defensive resistance over time (+/-5%)
- **Knowledge Test Performance**: Understanding Gogoplata mechanics (+/-10%)
- **Positional Control**: Effectiveness of hip adjustment and space management (+/-10%)

## Counter-Attack Analysis

### Common Counters
Opponent responses with success rates:
- **Posture Defense**: Posturing up to prevent shin placement → [[Control Escape]] (Success Rate: 25%, Conditions: early reaction)
- **Arm Frame**: Framing with arms to create space → [[Space Creation]] (Success Rate: 20%, Conditions: strong defense)
- **Head Pull Back**: Pulling head back to avoid shin → [[Setup Prevention]] (Success Rate: 15%, Conditions: quick adjustment)
- **Forward Pressure**: Driving forward to flatten guard → [[Guard Flattening]] (Success Rate: 10%, Conditions: significant leverage)
- **Hand Fighting**: Fighting grips to break control → [[Grip Breaking]] (Success Rate: 10%, Conditions: immediate action)

Format: `[[Counter Technique]] → [[Result State]] (Success Rate: X%, Conditions: [when applicable])`

### Decision Logic for Opponent Behavior
```
If [gogoplata setup] is not fully secured:
- Execute [[Posture Defense]] (Probability: 25%)

Else if [arm frame] can create space:
- Execute [[Arm Frame]] (Probability: 20%)

Else if [head pull back] avoids shin:
- Execute [[Head Pull Back]] (Probability: 15%)

Else if [forward pressure] flattens guard:
- Execute [[Forward Pressure]] (Probability: 10%)

Else [optimal setup execution]:
- Accept transition to [[Gogoplata Control]] (Probability: Success Rate - Modifiers)
```

## Defensive Considerations

### Common Threats During Attempt
Primary risks while attempting this setup:
- **Posture Defense**: Opponent postures up to prevent shin placement → [[Control Escape]] (Threat Level: Medium)
- **Space Creation**: Opponent frames to create defensive space → [[Space Creation]] (Threat Level: Medium)
- **Setup Prevention**: Opponent pulls head back to avoid shin → [[Setup Prevention]] (Threat Level: Low)
- **Guard Flattening**: Opponent drives forward to flatten guard → [[Guard Flattening]] (Threat Level: Low)

Format: `[[Threat Type]] → [[Resulting Position]] (Threat Level: X)`

### Defensive Strategies
Methods to mitigate threats:
- **Wrist Control**: Maintain tight grip on wrist to prevent framing
- **Hip Mobility**: Adjust hips to counter posture defense and maintain angle
- **Shin Insertion**: Slide shin quickly and precisely to avoid head pull-back
- **Space Management**: Minimize space to block forward pressure
- **Adaptation Readiness**: Be prepared to switch to other submissions or controls if setup fails

## Educational Content

### Expert Insights
Commentary as if from recognized authorities:
- **John Danaher**: "While not a primary focus in my system, the Gogoplata Setup showcases mechanical principles of control. Incremental establishment of control points before committing to the final position is key."
- **Gordon Ryan**: "The Gogoplata Setup is a specialized attack with critical vulnerability during transition. Defensive awareness at this stage can nullify the attack before it’s established."
- **Eddie Bravo**: "The Gogoplata Setup is central to the 10th Planet system, with subtle details like the 'shin fade' technique to disguise the attack. It’s the most technically demanding part of the sequence."

Each insight should focus on one key technical or strategic element.

### Common Errors
For knowledge test generation:
- **Error**: Insufficient flexibility for shin placement
- **Why It Fails**: Prevents proper positioning of shin across throat
- **Correction**: Develop hip flexibility specific to Gogoplata mechanics
- **Recognition**: Difficulty sliding shin into position without losing control

- **Error**: Premature loss of wrist control
- **Why It Fails**: Allows opponent to frame defensively and escape setup
- **Correction**: Maintain constant grip on opponent's wrist or arm
- **Recognition**: Opponent easily creates space or breaks control

- **Error**: Incorrect shin angle or placement
- **Why It Fails**: Reduces effectiveness of choking mechanism
- **Correction**: Position shin directly across throat, not jawline or collarbone
- **Recognition**: Shin slips or fails to apply pressure correctly
