## Description
The Gogoplata Setup represents the critical transitional phase where the practitioner maneuvers from an established Rubber Guard control position (typically New York Control or Williams Guard) into the final Gogoplata Control position. This transition requires exceptional hip mobility and technical precision to successfully position the shin across the opponent's throat while maintaining arm control. Unlike more common submissions, the Gogoplata uses the practitioner's shin as the primary choking mechanism rather than the arms, making it particularly effective against opponents focused on defending conventional upper body submissions. The setup phase is arguably the most technically demanding aspect of the entire Gogoplata sequence, requiring coordinated hip movement, grip adjustments, and precise shin placement to create the conditions for the subsequent submission.

## Execution Steps
1. Begin from established New York Control or Williams Guard
2. Maintain strong wrist/arm control with one hand
3. Create space by slightly adjusting hip position and angle
4. Begin to slide shin across opponent's neck/throat region
5. Guide foot behind opponent's head/neck
6. Secure foot behind head by applying light pressure
7. Adjust grip to control opponent's wrist/arm with optimal leverage
8. Finalize shin position directly across throat
9. Stabilize position by eliminating defensive space
10. Transition to active Gogoplata Control

## Key Details
- **Shin Placement**: Position shin directly across throat, not against jawline or collarbone
- **Wrist Control**: Maintain constant control of opponent's arm to prevent defensive frames
- **Foot Lock**: Secure foot behind opponent's head/neck region for stability
- **Hip Position**: Create optimal angle for shin placement through precise hip adjustment
- **Space Management**: Create just enough space for shin insertion without losing control
- **Angle Control**: Align body at slight diagonal for maximum mechanical efficiency
- **Grip Sequence**: Coordinate grip transitions to maintain constant control
- **Balance Management**: Maintain stable base throughout transition to prevent counters

## Common Counters
- [[Posture Defense]] → [[Control Escape]]
- [[Arm Frame]] → [[Space Creation]]
- [[Head Pull Back]] → [[Setup Prevention]]
- [[Forward Pressure]] → [[Guard Flattening]]
- [[Hand Fighting]] → [[Grip Breaking]]
- [[Stacking Defense]] → [[Position Reversal]]

## Variants
- Standard Gogoplata Setup (from New York Control)
- Williams to Gogoplata (from Williams Guard)
- Invisible Gogoplata Setup (minimizing telegraphing)
- Double-Trouble Gogoplata (with secondary control points)
- Shin Fade Gogoplata (indirect insertion approach)
- High-Angle Gogoplata (extreme angle variation)
- Dead Orchard to Gogoplata (from Dead Orchard Control)
- Meathook to Gogoplata (from Meathook Control)

## Expert Insights
- **Danaher System**: While not emphasizing the Gogoplata within his system, acknowledges the mechanical principles that make the setup effective, particularly the importance of incrementally establishing control points before committing to final position. Emphasizes understanding the fundamental mechanics of space creation and shin insertion that determine success or failure during the critical setup phase.
- **Gordon Ryan**: Rarely uses the Gogoplata but recognizes its value as a specialized attack. When analyzing the position, focuses on the setup phase as the critical vulnerability, emphasizing how proper defensive awareness during this transition can nullify the attack before it becomes established.
- **Eddie Bravo**: As the primary developer of the modern Gogoplata within his 10th Planet system, has refined the setup mechanics to maximize success probability. Emphasizes subtle details like "shin fade" technique to disguise the attack, precise foot positioning behind the head, and incremental pressure application. Considers the setup the most technically demanding aspect of the entire sequence, requiring extensive specialized training.

## Timing Considerations
- Execute after full establishment of prerequisite control position
- Time the setup when opponent's attention is divided
- Accelerate transition if opponent begins recognizing the threat
- Slow down execution when opponent resists to preserve control
- Coordinate setup with opponent's breathing cycle
- Capitalize on opportunities created by opponent's movement
- Deploy when opponent is focused on defending other attacks

## Setup Connections
- [[Rubber Guard]] → [[Mission Control]] → [[New York Control]] → [[Gogoplata Setup]]
- [[Mission Control]] → [[Williams Guard]] → [[Gogoplata Setup]]
- [[Dead Orchard Control]] → [[Arm Isolation]] → [[Gogoplata Setup]]
- [[Triangle Control]] → [[Position Adjustment]] → [[Gogoplata Setup]]
- [[Omoplata Control]] → [[Transitional Movement]] → [[Gogoplata Setup]]
- [[High Guard]] → [[Rubber Guard Entry]] → [[New York Control]] → [[Gogoplata Setup]]

## Follow-up Options
- [[Transition to Omoplata]] (if setup is compromised)
- [[Return to New York Control]] (if resistance is encountered)
- [[Switch to Triangle]] (if shin positioning fails)
- [[Williams Guard Recovery]] (if control is maintained but setup fails)
- [[Sweep to Mount]] (against specific defensive reactions)

## Common Errors
- Insufficient flexibility → Failed shin placement
- Premature loss of wrist control → Defensive escape
- Incorrect shin angle → Ineffective positioning
- Inadequate space creation → Restricted movement
- Failed foot positioning → Unstable control
- Telegraphing the transition → Defensive awareness

## Performance Tips
- Develop progressive flexibility specifically for this technique
- Practice isolated shin-placement drills with increasing resistance
- Focus on maintaining constant control throughout the transition
- Develop sensitivity to opponent's defensive preparations
- Practice fluid transitions between control positions
- Create awareness of common defensive patterns
- Maintain hip mobility and connection throughout the setup

## Training Approaches
- Partner drilling with incremental resistance
- Flexibility development specifically for Gogoplata mechanics
- Flow training between related Rubber Guard positions
- Defensive recognition drills with controlled responses
- Grip fighting sequences focused on transition maintenance
- Position-specific sparring starting from pre-setup positions

## Historical Context
The Gogoplata Setup represents a modern evolution in submission grappling technique, popularized primarily through Eddie Bravo's 10th Planet system. While shin-across-throat choking mechanics have existed in traditional martial arts, the systematic approach to establishing the position from the Rubber Guard framework represents a significant innovation in contemporary BJJ. The technique gained broader recognition when demonstrated effectively in high-profile MMA competitions by practitioners like Shinya Aoki and Nick Diaz. The development of the setup mechanics highlights how traditional submission principles can be applied through innovative pathways, expanding the technical vocabulary of modern jiu-jitsu beyond conventional approaches.

## Conceptual Framework
The Gogoplata Setup exemplifies the principle of "unconventional leverage creation" in BJJ, where submission pressure is generated through unexpected mechanical pathways. By utilizing the shin rather than the arms as the primary choking mechanism, the technique bypasses common defensive expectations and creates submission threats from angles that may not be readily anticipated. The setup represents the application of fundamental mechanical principles—leverage, angle creation, and space management—through a specialized execution pathway that expands the practitioner's attacking options beyond conventional submissions.

## Computer Science Analogy
The Gogoplata Setup functions as an "alternative pathfinding algorithm" in the BJJ state machine, where the system discovers and exploits a non-standard path to reach a terminal submission state. This exemplifies the concept of "heuristic optimization" where the system abandons commonly traversed edges (arm-based submissions) to explore a specialized but potentially more efficient path (shin-based submission) when certain preconditions are met. The transition represents a form of "polymorphic inheritance" where the fundamental methods of the parent class (submission mechanics) are overridden with specialized implementations that achieve the same goal through alternative means, creating a submission variant that inherits core principles while implementing unique execution logic.
