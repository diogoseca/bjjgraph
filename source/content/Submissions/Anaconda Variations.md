## ⚠️ SAFETY NOTICE
**Blood choke variations. Apply SLOWLY over 3-5 seconds. RELEASE upon tap. Be careful during rolling transitions.**

## Overview
Anaconda Variations include multiple setups and finishing positions: standard anaconda with roll, no-roll anaconda, standing anaconda, guard pull anaconda, and counter anaconda setups.

**Success Rates**: Beginner 20%, Intermediate 45%, Advanced 70%

## Common Variations

### Standard Anaconda (Gator Roll)
- From front headlock or turtle
- Trap near arm, thread opposite arm around neck
- Roll over trapped arm side
- Finish on back with squeeze

### No-Roll Anaconda
- Finish without rolling transition
- Maintain top pressure
- Squeeze from standing or kneeling

### Standing Anaconda
- Applied from standing clinch
- Can finish standing or pull guard
- Often used in wrestling contexts

### Guard Pull Anaconda
- Lock anaconda grip
- Pull guard to finish
- Common in gi competition

### Counter Anaconda
- Applied as counter to opponent's attack
- Opportunistic setup
- High surprise factor

## Execution Steps
1. Identify anaconda opportunity
2. Trap opponent's near arm
3. Thread arm around neck (opposite side)
4. Secure figure-four or gable grip
5. Roll to finish (if standard variation)
6. Progressive squeeze 3-5 seconds
7. RELEASE immediately upon tap

## Safety Notes
- Control rolling motion - don't drop partner on head
- Maintain grip awareness during dynamic transitions
- Partner should tap early if uncomfortable with roll

*Position before pressure. Safety above all.*
