# North-South to Kimura
#bjj #transition #north_south #kimura #submission

## Transition Properties
- **Transition ID**: T912
- **Starting State**: [[North-South]]
- **Ending State**: [[Kimura Control]]
- **Success Probability**: Beginner (50%), Intermediate (70%), Advanced (85%)
- **Execution Complexity**: Medium
- **Physical Attributes**: Grip Strength, Core Control, Shoulder Mobility

## Transition Description
The North-South to Kimura transition represents a high-percentage submission pathway that converts a strong controlling position (North-South) into a powerful shoulder lock setup (Kimura Control). This transition exploits the opponent's arm positioning and defensive reactions to isolate and manipulate the shoulder joint while maintaining upper body control. Unlike maintaining North-South purely for positional dominance, this transition creates an immediate submission threat that forces specific defensive reactions, often leading to a cascade of submission opportunities or positional advancements. The technical execution focuses on precise grip establishment, body positioning, and leverage application to secure the figure-four grip on the opponent's arm while maintaining dominant pressure. This transition exemplifies BJJ's principle of exploiting limb isolation from controlling positions, where strategic weight distribution and grip fighting create submission opportunities from seemingly secure defensive postures.

### Visual Execution Sequence
Detailed step-by-step description for clear movement sequence visualization:

From the North-South position, you are positioned perpendicular to your opponent with your chest pressing down on their chest or face, your weight distributed to control their upper body while your legs sprawl back for base. You identify their near-side arm as the primary target, often exposed as they attempt to frame or create defensive space, and you immediately establish wrist control with your hand closest to their arm. Maintaining chest pressure with your upper body, you begin to create space on the targeted side by slightly shifting your weight while keeping them pinned, threading your free arm underneath their upper arm near the shoulder. Your threading arm reaches across to connect with your wrist-controlling hand, establishing the characteristic figure-four grip configuration, with your hands locked together palm-to-palm or wrist-to-wrist depending on your preference. You adjust your body position to optimize leverage, often moving your hips toward their head while keeping their shoulder isolated and their arm bent at approximately 90 degrees. As you settle into the Kimura control position, you maintain constant pressure on their shoulder joint through the figure-four grip, your body weight distributed to prevent their escape while the rotational potential of the locked grip threatens their shoulder, forcing them to react defensively or tap to avoid dislocation.

**Template**: "From North-South perpendicular to opponent, chest pressing on their chest/face. Identify near-side arm, establish wrist control with one hand. Shift weight, create space, thread free arm under their upper arm near shoulder. Connect hands in figure-four grip (palm-to-palm or wrist-to-wrist). Adjust body position, move hips toward head, isolate shoulder with arm at 90 degrees. Maintain pressure through figure-four grip with body weight preventing escape, rotational grip threatening shoulder until defensive reaction or tap."

## ⚠️ Safety Considerations

### Injury Risks
Kimura submissions can cause serious shoulder injuries if applied incorrectly:
- **Shoulder Dislocation** (Severity: Critical, Recovery: 3-6 months) - Excessive rotation can dislocate the glenohumeral joint, requiring medical intervention
- **Rotator Cuff Tear** (Severity: High, Recovery: 4-12 months) - Forceful shoulder rotation can tear the rotator cuff muscles, often requiring surgery
- **AC Joint Separation** (Severity: High, Recovery: 6-12 weeks) - Extreme pressure can separate the acromioclavicular joint
- **Labrum Tear** (Severity: High, Recovery: 4-9 months) - Twisting motion can tear the labrum cartilage in the shoulder socket

### Application Speed
- Apply submissions SLOWLY and progressively over 3-5 seconds minimum
- Never apply sudden twisting or cranking movements to the shoulder
- Maintain constant awareness of partner's tap signals
- Increase rotation incrementally to allow proper tap response time

### Tap Signals
Partners must establish clear tap signals before training:
- **Verbal Tap**: Saying "tap" or "stop" loudly
- **Physical Tap**: Tapping partner's body, mat, or own body with free hand (minimum 2 taps)
- **Emergency Signal**: Verbal "stop" if unable to physically tap due to position

### Release Protocol
When partner taps:
1. Immediately stop all rotational pressure on the shoulder
2. Release the figure-four grip on their arm
3. Allow their arm to return to neutral position gradually
4. Release body pressure and check on partner's shoulder mobility

### Training Progression
- **Weeks 1-2**: Positional control only, practice grip acquisition without applying pressure
- **Weeks 3-4**: Slow-motion kimura with zero resistance (10% speed), partner taps at 20% rotation
- **Weeks 5-8**: Medium speed with light resistance (50% speed), partner taps at 40% rotation
- **Ongoing**: Full speed only with experienced partners, always respecting early taps

### Partner Communication
- Establish tap awareness before drilling kimura techniques
- Discuss shoulder mobility limitations before training (previous injuries, flexibility)
- Verbal check-ins during drilling: "Pressure okay?" to ensure partner safety

## Execution Steps
1. Establish secure North-South position with proper weight distribution
2. Identify and target opponent's exposed arm (typically the near-side arm)
3. Secure initial wrist control of the targeted arm
4. Create space on the target side while maintaining chest pressure
5. Thread non-control arm under opponent's upper arm to establish figure-four grip
6. Secure figure-four grip by connecting hands (typically palm-to-palm or wrist grip)
7. Adjust body position to maximize leverage on isolated shoulder
8. Stabilize final Kimura control with proper weight distribution and connection points

## Key Details
- **Arm Isolation**: Create and maintain separation of target arm from opponent's body
- **Grip Sequence**: Progress from initial wrist control to secure figure-four lock
- **Weight Distribution**: Shift from centered pressure to targeted side pressure
- **Space Creation**: Strategic space management to enable grip transitions
- **Body Positioning**: Alignment relative to opponent's shoulder for optimal leverage
- **Pressure Maintenance**: Continuous control throughout transitional movement
- **Defensive Awareness**: Anticipate and counter common defensive reactions
- **Shoulder Alignment**: Critical positioning to maximize mechanical advantage

## Common Counters
- [[Arm Tuck]] → [[Grip Prevention]]
- [[Bridge and Roll]] → [[Position Escape]]
- [[Grip Fighting]] → [[Defensive Hand Fighting]]
- [[Turn Away]] → [[Turtle Position]]
- [[Connect Hands]] → [[Defensive Frame]]

## Variants
- Classic North-South Kimura (traditional approach)
- Step-Over Kimura (incorporating leg positioning)
- Short Grip Kimura (variation with modified grip)
- Running Kimura (transitional flow variation)
- Reverse Kimura (attacking opposite side arm)
- Near-Side Kimura (targeting arm closest to head)
- Far-Side Kimura (targeting arm furthest from head)
- Kimura/Armbar Combination (dual-threat approach)

## Expert Insights
- **Danaher System**: Emphasizes the importance of establishing complete control of the opponent's upper arm before attempting to secure the figure-four grip. Focuses on creating mechanical disadvantages through precise positioning that make defensive reactions ineffective. Particularly emphasizes creating a "wedge position" with the knee to prevent the opponent from turning away during the grip establishment phase.
- **Gordon Ryan**: Approaches the North-South Kimura as part of an integrated upper body submission system, often using the threat to create defensive reactions that expose other submissions. Utilizes subtle weight shifts and misdirection to create openings for the Kimura entry. Places significant emphasis on controlling the opponent's hips during the transition to prevent defensive movements.
- **Eddie Bravo**: Has developed specialized setups that integrate with his 10th Planet system. Particularly focuses on creating submission chains where the Kimura threat forces predictable defensive patterns. Emphasizes the importance of the "zombie control" concept where pressure is maintained throughout transition phases.

## Timing Considerations
- Execute when opponent's arm is naturally exposed in defensive posture
- Time with opponent's attempt to frame or create space
- Capitalize on opponent's bridge recovery (post-bridge moment)
- Transition when opponent commits weight to elbow escape
- Implement during opponent's attempt to recover guard
- Execute following hand-fighting sequence that creates arm isolation

## Setup Connections
- [[North-South Control]] → [[North-South to Kimura]]
- [[Failed North-South Choke]] → [[North-South to Kimura]]
- [[Side Control to North-South]] → [[North-South to Kimura]]
- [[Sprawl Position]] → [[North-South to Kimura]]
- [[Front Headlock Transition]] → [[North-South to Kimura]]
- [[Cross-Face Control]] → [[North-South to Kimura]]

## Follow-up Options
- [[Kimura Finish]] → [[Won by Submission]]
- [[Kimura to Armbar]] → [[Armbar Control]]
- [[Kimura to Back Take]] → [[Back Control]]
- [[Kimura to Tarikoplata]] → [[Shoulder Lock]]
- [[Step-Over Sequence]] → [[Modified Control]]
- [[Near-Side Armbar]] → [[Armbar Control]]

## Common Errors
- Insufficient isolation of target arm → Defensive connection
- Poor figure-four grip alignment → Reduced mechanical advantage
- Telegraphing submission intent → Early defensive reaction
- Loss of chest pressure during transition → Control compromise
- Improper angle relative to shoulder → Ineffective leverage
- Focusing solely on arm without controlling body → Defensive escape opportunity
- Rushing the submission → Grip establishment failure

## Performance Tips

## Conceptual Framework
The North-South to Kimura transition exemplifies fundamental BJJ principles of positional control leading to submission opportunity. This technique transforms a secure controlling position into a direct submission threat, demonstrating how dominant positions serve not only as defensive checkpoints but as launching platforms for offensive sequences. The execution represents BJJ's emphasis on mechanical leverage and precise grip establishment, creating situations where technical application overcomes raw strength. This transition highlights how systematic grip fighting and body positioning create submission opportunities even against defensive awareness, forming the foundation of advanced submission chains.

## Computer Science Analogy
The North-South to Kimura transition functions as a "state optimization function" within the BJJ state machine, where a stable control state (North-South) evolves into a terminal submission state (Kimura Control) through a sequence of precise input manipulations. This process mirrors how computing systems implement optimization algorithms that transform data structures into more advantageous configurations through sequential transformations.

The transition represents a form of "resource allocation strategy," where control resources initially distributed for positional security are strategically redistributed to create a submission opportunity. This pattern demonstrates the concept of "just-in-time compilation" in computing, where general control structures are transformed into specialized configurations when specific execution conditions are detected.

The figure-four grip functions as a "mutual exclusion lock" in computing terms, restricting access to a critical resource (the opponent's shoulder mobility) while maintaining privileged access for the controlling player. In essence, the North-South to Kimura transition exemplifies how BJJ's positional control framework systematically transforms general dominance into specific mechanical advantage, similar to how computing systems refine general data structures into optimized configurations when advantageous patterns are recognized.
