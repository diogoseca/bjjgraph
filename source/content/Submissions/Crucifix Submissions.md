## ⚠️ SAFETY NOTICE

**Crucifix submissions trap both of opponent's arms, limiting their ability to tap physically.**

- **Injury Risks**: Loss of consciousness from chokes, shoulder dislocation, arm damage
- **Application Speed**: SLOW and progressive. 3-5 seconds minimum.
- **Tap Signals**: VERBAL TAP is PRIMARY since arms are trapped. Establish before position.
- **Release Protocol**: Release attack immediately, free trapped arms, monitor partner
- **Training Requirement**: Intermediate level with back control experience
- **Never**: Apply multiple attacks simultaneously, ignore verbal taps, trap arms without agreement

**CRITICAL**: Always establish verbal tap signals BEFORE entering crucifix. Your partner cannot tap physically if both arms are trapped. Listen for "TAP" and release immediately.

## Overview

The [[Crucifix Position]] is one of the most dominant positions in BJJ, trapping both of the opponent's arms and leaving them defenseless. From this position, multiple submissions become available including chokes, arm locks, and neck cranks.

The position's greatest strength - trapping both arms - is also its greatest safety concern: the opponent cannot tap physically. Verbal communication must be established before attempting crucifix submissions.

**Success Rates**: Beginner 30%, Intermediate 50%, Advanced 70%

**PRIMARY SAFETY CONCERN**: Verbal taps must be respected immediately.
