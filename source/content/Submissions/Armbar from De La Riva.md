##   SAFETY NOTICE

**This submission can cause SERIOUS ELBOW INJURY if applied improperly.**

- **Injury Risks**: Elbow hyperextension, ligament damage (UCL/MCL tears), elbow dislocation
- **Application Speed**: SLOW and progressive. 3-5 seconds minimum from lock to tap.
- **Tap Signals**: Verbal "tap", physical tap with free hand/feet
- **Release Protocol**: Stop hip extension ’ Release arm grip ’ Open legs ’ Check partner's elbow
- **Training Requirement**: Intermediate level - requires DLR guard knowledge
- **Never**: Apply explosively - elbow injuries can be permanent

## Overview

The Armbar from De La Riva Guard is an advanced submission that capitalizes on the opponent's arm positioning while they defend the DLR hook. This technique requires strong DLR guard fundamentals and good timing to isolate the arm properly.

The setup typically occurs when the opponent posts or reaches while defending the DLR position, creating an opportunity to transition to the armbar configuration.

### Submission Properties

From [[De La Riva Guard Bottom]] (S025):

**Success Rates**:
- Beginner: 30%
- Intermediate: 50%
- Advanced: 70%

**Technical Characteristics**:
- **Setup Complexity**: High - requires DLR control and timing
- **Execution Speed**: Medium - 3-5 seconds in training
- **Escape Difficulty**: Medium - escapes available if caught early
- **Damage Potential**: High - serious elbow injury possible
- **Target Area**: Elbow joint (hyperextension)

## Execution Steps

**SAFETY REMINDER**: Apply pressure SLOWLY. Watch for tap signals continuously.

1. **DLR Setup** (Position Phase)
   - Establish DLR hook on opponent's leg
   - Control arm with grip
   - Create off-balance

2. **Arm Isolation** (Setup Phase)
   - Capture extended arm
   - Control wrist with both hands
   - Begin transition from DLR

3. **Position Transition** (Movement Phase)
   - Swing leg over for armbar
   - Release DLR hook
   - Position hips under elbow

4. **Lock Configuration** (Entry Phase)
   - Legs frame head and shoulder
   - Arm pulled tight to chest
   - Hip angle created

5. **Progressive Pressure** (Execution Phase)
   - Extend hips slowly (3-5 seconds)
   - Pull arm toward chest
   - Monitor tap signals continuously

6. **Release** (Safety Phase)
   - Stop upon tap
   - Release arm grip immediately
   - Check partner's elbow

## Expert Insights

### John Danaher
"The armbar from De La Riva requires excellent timing and coordination. The DLR position creates natural arm exposure as opponents defend. The key is smoothly transitioning from the hook to the armbar configuration while maintaining control. Apply pressure progressively."

### Gordon Ryan
"I use DLR armbars in competition when opponents overcommit to passing. In training, I take extra time to ensure the setup is clean. DLR transitions can be scramble-heavy, so make sure you have full control before applying pressure."

### Eddie Bravo
"DLR is a great armbar platform because opponents are already off-balanced. We drill lots of DLR to armbar transitions in 10th Planet. Remember - creative setups, safe finishes. Always."

## Common Errors

**Error 1: Losing DLR Control Too Early**
- Releasing hook before arm is secured
- Correction: Maintain DLR until arm is controlled

**Error 2: Poor Hip Position**
- Hips not under elbow properly
- Correction: Pivot to create proper angle

**DANGER: Explosive Application**
- Applying pressure too quickly from DLR transition
- Correction: 3-5 second minimum application
- **This can cause immediate elbow injury**
