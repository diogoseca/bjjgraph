## Transition Description
The Switch to Triangle is a tactical transition that redirects an existing attack or control position into the powerful triangle choke position. This transition capitalizes on the opponent's defensive reactions to other threats, creating an opportunity to secure their head and one arm between the practitioner's legs. Unlike direct triangle attacks, the switch relies on the opponent's defensive movement and positioning that can be exploited when they focus on defending a different submission or control position. This technique exemplifies the concept of chain attacks, where the threat of one submission creates the opening for another, making it particularly effective against skilled opponents who successfully defend initial attacks.

## Execution Steps
1. From initial position, recognize opponent's defensive structure and arm positioning
2. Control opponent's wrist or sleeve on one side
3. Create angle by shifting hips perpendicular to opponent
4. Insert leg over opponent's shoulder on the controlled arm side
5. Secure opponent's arm across their centerline
6. Lock legs in figure-four configuration with one leg over opponent's shoulder and the other under their arm
7. Pull down on opponent's head to close space
8. Adjust angle and leg positioning to maximize pressure on carotid arteries

## Key Details
- **Angle Creation**: Position at perpendicular angle to opponent for optimal leverage
- **Arm Control**: Manipulate opponent's arm across centerline before securing triangle
- **Head Control**: Pull head down to eliminate defensive space
- **Leg Positioning**: Lock in figure-four with precise placement across neck and arm
- **Hip Mobility**: Create and maintain proper angle through active hip movement
- **Grip Sequence**: Maintain sleeve/collar control during transition for positional control
- **Entry Timing**: Execute during opponent's defensive adjustment to initial threat
- **Space Management**: Close all defensive gaps as triangle position is secured

## Common Counters
- [[Posture Up]] → [[Triangle Escape Position]]
- [[Stack Defense]] → [[Triangle Escape Position]]
- [[Hand Fight]] → [[Grip Breaking]]
- [[Shoulder Walk]] → [[Defensive Posture]]
- [[Arm Positioning Defense]] → [[Combat Base]]

## Variants
- Armbar to triangle transition
- Omoplata to triangle switch
- Overhook closed guard to triangle

## Tactical Applications
- Capitalize on opponent's focus on defending other submissions

- Force defensive postures that make the triangle more accessible
- Establish control position with multiple follow-up threats
- Counter specific guard passing attempts
- Convert failed submission attempts into successful ones
- Exploit opponent's arm positioning when posted for base

## Expert Insights
- **Danaher System**: Emphasizes the switch to triangle as part of a systematic attack chain where submissions are connected through positional control rather than treated as isolated techniques. Focuses on maintaining constant threat and pressure throughout the transition, ensuring the opponent is always defending something rather than establishing their own offense. Particularly emphasizes the mechanical details of proper angle and leg positioning to maximize effectiveness.
- **Gordon Ryan**: Uses the triangle switch primarily as a response to specific defensive reactions to his primary attacks. Places significant emphasis on recognizing the precise moment when an opponent's defense to one submission creates the opening for the triangle, viewing the technique as an opportunistic counter rather than a forced attack. Focuses on maintaining control of defensive structures throughout the transition.
- **Eddie Bravo**: Has developed specialized setups for the triangle switch within his 10th Planet system, particularly from rubber guard variations. Emphasizes unorthodox entries and setups that opponents may be less familiar with, focusing on creating confusion through rapid transitions between different submission threats. Specifically developed the "Vaporizer" and "Crackhead Control" as unique entries to the triangle.

## Common Errors
- Insufficient angle creation → Reduced choking pressure
- Poor arm control → Easy defensive frame
- Failing to pull head down → Opponent can posture up
- Crossing ankles incorrectly → Ineffective lock
- Neglecting to cut angle → Square alignment reduces effectiveness
- Telegraphing transition → Premature defense
- Rushing the transition → Position compromise

## Performance Tips
- Focus on controlling opponent's posture throughout the transition
- Create proper angle before attempting to lock the triangle
- Maintain continuous control of opponent's arm during the switch
- Recognize ideal timing when opponent is focused on defending other threats
- Practice fluid transitions between related submissions
- Develop awareness of opponent's defensive tendencies
- Adjust triangle configuration based on your body proportions and opponent's neck size

## Training Approaches
- Submission chain drills (Armbar-Triangle-Omoplata)
- Positional sparring focusing on triangle entries
- Partner drills isolating the defensive reactions that create openings
- Solo mobility exercises for hip dexterity
- Video study of submission specialists known for triangle expertise
- Progressive resistance drills for transition timing

## Timing Considerations
- Execute during opponent's defense to initial submission threat
- Implement when opponent posts an arm for base
- Time with opponent's posture adjustment
- Apply when opponent's arm crosses centerline
- Synchronize with opponent's weight shift or base adjustment
- Initiate when opponent commits to defending a different submission

## Strategic Contexts
- As secondary attack in submission chains
- Against opponents with strong submission defense
- In competition scenarios requiring submission victory
- When opponent establishes predictable defensive patterns
- Against opponents who post arms to maintain base
- As counter to specific guard passing approaches

## Conceptual Relationship to Computer Science
The Switch to Triangle implements a "fallback mechanism" similar to exception handling in programming, where the system detects that the primary process (initial submission attempt) cannot complete successfully and seamlessly transfers to an alternative execution path (triangle). This creates an "if-else" control structure within the BJJ state machine: IF (initial submission succeeds) THEN execute submission sequence ELSE switch to triangle pathway. The concept demonstrates "graceful degradation" where even failed attempts contribute to the overall attack strategy by forcing defensive reactions that create openings for alternative attacks. This implements principles of "fault-tolerant design" where the system can adapt to unexpected resistance and still achieve its objective through alternative pathways.
