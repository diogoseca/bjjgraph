##   SAFETY NOTICE

**This submission can cause SERIOUS ELBOW INJURY if applied improperly.**

Elbow injuries from armbars can be permanent. Apply SLOW progressive pressure over 3-5 seconds minimum. Release immediately upon tap. Respect your training partner's joint health.

## Overview

The Armbar from Half Guard is an opportunistic submission when the opponent extends their arm while attempting to pass or defend. It requires good hip mobility and timing to transition from the half guard position to the armbar configuration.

### Submission Properties

From [[Half Guard Bottom]] (S030):

**Success Rates**: Beginner 25%, Intermediate 45%, Advanced 65%

**Characteristics**: High setup complexity, medium execution speed, high damage potential. Target: Elbow joint hyperextension.

## Execution Steps

1. **Half Guard Control**: Establish half guard with underhook or frame
2. **Arm Isolation**: Capture extended arm when opponent reaches
3. **Hip Escape**: Create space and angle for transition
4. **Leg Configuration**: Swing leg over for armbar, maintain half guard leg temporarily
5. **Position Refinement**: Release half guard, position hips under elbow
6. **Progressive Pressure**: Apply slow hip extension over 3-5 seconds
7. **Release Upon Tap**: Stop immediately, check partner's elbow

## Expert Insights

### John Danaher
"Half guard armbars require excellent timing because you're transitioning from a defensive position. The key is recognizing when the opponent extends their arm to complete the pass. Clean transitions preserve safety."

### Gordon Ryan
"I catch half guard armbars when opponents get impatient passing. They reach, I capitalize. In training, I make sure the position is locked before applying pressure. Half guard transitions can be chaotic."

### Eddie Bravo
"We have multiple half guard armbar setups in 10th Planet - lockdown to armbar, electric chair to armbar, lots of entries. Every finish requires the same safety: slow, controlled pressure."

## Common Errors

**Error: Forcing from Poor Position**
- Attempting armbar without proper angle
- Correction: Ensure clean transition and hip position

**DANGER: Explosive Finish from Scramble**
- Rushing the finish during transition
- **This can cause immediate elbow injury**
- Correction: Pause, establish control, then apply slowly
