## LLM Context: Submission Data Structure

**Purpose**: Fundamental shoulder lock from mount. Terminal state. Moderate-high injury risk requires controlled application.

**Setup Checklist**:
- [ ] Mount (S001) with secure base
- [ ] Opponent's arm bent (defensive frame typical)
- [ ] Figure-four grip locked (wrist to wrist)
- [ ] Elbow controlled close to body
- [ ] Rotation angle perpendicular to spine
- [ ] Partner can tap clearly

**Safety Q&A**:
Q: "Speed?" A: "3-5 seconds progressive rotation in training"
Q: "Tap signals?" A: "Verbal, hand tap, foot tap all valid"
Q: "Stop when?" A: "Tap, shoulder resistance, discomfort, uncertainty"

## ⚠️ SAFETY NOTICE

**This submission can cause ROTATOR CUFF INJURY and SHOULDER DAMAGE if applied improperly.**

- **Injuries**: Rotator cuff strain/tear (2-8 weeks), shoulder capsule damage (4-12 weeks), possible dislocation
- **Speed**: 3-5 seconds minimum progressive rotation
- **Tap Signals**: Verbal tap, physical tap with free hand/feet
- **Release**: Stop rotation immediately, release figure-four, check shoulder
- **Training**: Beginners need supervision, intermediate+ can practice safely
- **Never**: Explosive rotation or forcing past resistance point

**Remember**: Shoulder locks have potential for serious injury. Apply progressively and release immediately upon tap.

## Overview

The Kimura from Mount is a high-percentage shoulder lock executed from the dominant mount position. By isolating the opponent's bent arm and applying a figure-four grip, you create leverage to rotate their shoulder beyond its natural range of motion. The mount position provides weight advantage and control, making this one of the most reliable kimura variations.

From [[Mount]] (S001), the kimura is typically available when the opponent frames defensively with bent arms, attempts to push you away, or reaches to defend other attacks. The technique can be finished as a submission or used as a powerful control position to force reactions and create other opportunities.

This is a fundamental technique taught to beginners with proper safety emphasis, progressing to advanced applications including sweeps, back takes, and transitional control.

## Visual Finishing Sequence

From mount, your opponent frames with their right arm bent, attempting to create space. You control their right wrist with your right hand, threading your left arm under their arm and grabbing your own right wrist, creating a figure-four configuration. You maintain mount base while rotating their arm upward and toward their head, keeping the elbow close to their body.

The opponent feels increasing pressure on their shoulder as you rotate. The shoulder joint reaches its limit of internal rotation. Recognizing the submission is locked, they tap with their left hand on the mat or your leg. You immediately stop rotation and release the figure-four grip, checking that their shoulder is okay.

**Body Positioning**:
- **Your position**: Mount with stable base, upper body controlling arm, figure-four grip locked, weight distributed
- **Opponent's position**: On back under mount, right arm trapped in figure-four, left arm free to tap
- **Key pressure points**: Shoulder in internal rotation beyond comfortable range
- **Leverage**: Mount weight + figure-four grip + rotation = shoulder lock

## Execution Steps

**SAFETY REMINDER**: Apply rotation progressively over 3-5 seconds. Stop at resistance point. Watch for tap signals.

1. **Grip Establishment** (Setup Phase)
   - From mount, opponent frames with bent right arm
   - Control their right wrist with your right hand
   - Thread left arm under their arm from outside
   - Grab your own right wrist (figure-four locked)
   - Safety: Ensure partner's left hand free to tap

2. **Elbow Control** (Position Phase)
   - Pull their elbow close to your body
   - Keep elbow near their ribcage (not lifted high)
   - Maintain mount base with knees
   - Partner check: Arm controlled, comfortable starting position

3. **Initial Rotation** (Entry Phase)
   - Begin rotating arm toward their head
   - Keep elbow stationary near ribs
   - Rotate hand/wrist upward
   - Speed: SLOW initial movement (1-2 seconds)
   - Watch for: Partner awareness, early tap

4. **Progressive Tightening** (Execution Phase)
   - Continue rotation incrementally
   - Increase angle toward their head
   - Maintain elbow position
   - Speed: 2-3 seconds progressive increase
   - Monitor: Tap signals, shoulder position, resistance

5. **Completion** (Submission Phase)
   - Reach maximum rotation angle
   - Maintain pressure until tap
   - Do not force past resistance
   - Critical: WATCH for tap signals continuously

6. **Release** (Safety Phase)
   - **IMMEDIATELY upon tap**: Stop rotation
   - Release figure-four grip
   - Return to mount or neutral
   - Ask: "Shoulder okay?"
   - Total release: 2-3 seconds

**Total Time**: 3-5 seconds from initial rotation to tap in training. Drilling: 7-10 seconds.

## Anatomical Targeting

**Target**: Shoulder joint (glenohumeral), rotator cuff (primarily subscapularis and infraspinatus)
**Mechanism**: Internal rotation beyond natural range creates rotator cuff strain
**Injury Risk**: Moderate-High (rotator cuff tears, shoulder capsule damage)

**Prevention**:
- Progressive rotation (3-5 seconds minimum)
- Stop at resistance point
- Keep elbow close to their body (lifting elbow increases injury risk)
- Release immediately upon tap

## Training Progressions

**Phase 1-2** (Weeks 1-4): Grip mechanics, zero pressure, cooperative drilling
**Phase 3-4** (Weeks 5-12): Light pressure (40-60%), progressive resistance
**Phase 5-6** (Week 13+): Live application with control, safety ingrained

## Expert Insights

### John Danaher
> "The kimura from mount is one of the most versatile techniques in jiu-jitsu. From this position, you have submission, sweep, and positional advancement all available. The key is keeping the elbow close to their body - this maximizes control and safety while optimizing mechanical advantage. In training, achieve the position and control before seeking the finish."

### Gordon Ryan
> "This is one of my highest percentage finishes from mount. The weight advantage makes it very hard to escape once locked. In competition, I finish quickly. In training, I use it as control - holding the position and making partner work before releasing or transitioning. Your training partners need healthy shoulders."

### Eddie Bravo
> "The kimura from mount connects to everything - back takes, arm crushing, sweeps if they bridge. It's a fundamental control position that opens up the whole system. Safety-wise, it's more forgiving than some shoulder locks, but you still need control and progressive pressure."

## Common Errors

**Technical**:
1. Elbow lifted too high - reduces control, increases injury risk
2. Figure-four grip too loose - allows arm escape
3. Losing mount base during application - allows escape

**SAFETY ERRORS**:
- **DANGER: Explosive Rotation** - causes immediate rotator cuff tears
- **DANGER: Forcing Past Resistance** - tears shoulder tissues
- **DANGER: Ignoring Tap** - unnecessary injury

## Knowledge Assessment

1. **Primary grip?** Figure-four configuration - your hands gripping each other, forming frame around their wrist/arm
2. **Elbow position?** Close to their body near ribs, NOT lifted high - high elbow loses control and increases injury
3. **Rotation direction?** Toward their head, rotating hand upward while keeping elbow stationary
4. **Speed in training?** 3-5 seconds progressive rotation minimum, slower in drilling
5. **When to release?** Immediately upon any tap signal, at resistance point, if partner shows distress

## Variations

**Gi**: Can grip sleeve for additional control
**No-Gi**: Must rely on wrist/hand control, potentially more difficult grip
**High Mount**: Better angle for finish
**S-Mount**: Transition to arm triangle or back take if defended
