## Visual Execution Sequence

From guard position with opponent's head controlled, you wrap your arm around their neck with your wrist positioned under their throat. You secure your grip by clasping your hands together or grabbing your wrist, then fall to your side while closing your guard. As you extend your hips forward and arch your back, you simultaneously pull up with your choking arm, compressing the carotid arteries or trachea. The combination of hip extension, back arch, and arm pull creates powerful choking pressure that forces submission.

### Execution Steps
1. **Setup**: Control opponent's head from guard or standing
2. **Arm Insertion**: Wrap arm deep around neck
3. **Grip Configuration**: Clasp hands or grab wrist
4. **Guard Closure**: Close guard and fall to side
5. **Hip Extension**: Drive hips forward while arching back
6. **Completion**: Pull up with arm until tap

### Success Modifiers
- **Grip Depth**: Deep arm penetration (+/-20%)
- **Hip Extension**: Full forward drive (+/-15%)
- **Guard Control**: Secured closed guard (+/-10%)
- **Timing**: Optimal setup moment (+/-15%)

- Faster setup, less control
- More scramble situations
- Traditional variation

### Ten-Finger Guillotine

## Expert Insights
- **John Danaher**: "The guillotine choke succeeds through proper arm positioning and hip extension mechanics. The key is achieving deep arm penetration under the throat before opponent can defend. The power comes from hip drive and back arch, not arm strength alone. Different grip configurations create different choking mechanisms."
- **Gordon Ryan**: "I favor the high-elbow guillotine for its precision and reliability. The arm-in variation provides more control but can be defended by skilled opponents. In competition, I use guillotine entries to sweep or take the back if the finish isn't immediately available. It's a versatile attacking system."
- **Eddie Bravo**: "The guillotine is perhaps the most dynamic submission in no-gi grappling. From standing, from guard, from scrambles - it's available everywhere. The key is recognizing windows of opportunity and committing fully. Half-hearted guillotine attempts give up position. Master multiple grips to adapt to defensive reactions."

## Common Errors
- **Shallow arm depth**: Forearm too high on neck
- **Poor hip extension**: Not driving hips forward
- **Weak back arch**: Insufficient spinal extension
- **Wrong grip configuration**: Using ineffective hand position
- **Insufficient guard control**: Opponent escapes hooks

### SAFETY ERRORS
- **Explosive cranking**: Sudden jerking causing neck injury
- **Ignoring tap**: Continuing after submission
- **Excessive neck crank**: Targeting spine instead of throat
- **Dropping weight**: Falling heavily on opponent's neck

## Training Progressions
- **Weeks 1-4**: Grip mechanics and positioning (no pressure)
- **Weeks 5-10**: Controlled application at 40-50% pressure
- **Weeks 11-16**: Building to 70% with various grips
- **Months 5+**: Live integration with safety maintained
- **Focus**: Control before cranking, always
