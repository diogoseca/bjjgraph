##   SAFETY NOTICE

**SERIOUS ELBOW INJURY RISK** - Apply SLOW progressive pressure. Elbow injuries are permanent. 3-5 seconds minimum. Release immediately upon tap.

## Overview

The Armbar from Triangle is a classic submission combination. When the opponent defends the triangle by creating space or posturing, their arm becomes vulnerable. The transition from triangle to armbar is smooth and creates a dangerous dilemma - defend one submission, expose the other.

This technique exemplifies chain submission principles and is fundamental to developing a complete guard attack system.

### Submission Properties

From [[Triangle Control]] (S045):

**Success Rates**: Beginner 30%, Intermediate 50%, Advanced 70%

**Characteristics**: Medium complexity, high damage potential. Excellent combination attack.

## Execution Steps

1. **Triangle Setup**: Establish triangle position (locked or near-locked)
2. **Recognition**: Opponent defends by creating space or posting
3. **Release Triangle**: Open triangle configuration
4. **Capture Arm**: Secure trapped arm with both hands on wrist
5. **Leg Adjustment**: Swing leg that was over head down, other leg over face
6. **Hip Position**: Position hips under elbow, create angle
7. **Progressive Pressure**: Apply slow hip extension (3-5 seconds)
8. **Release**: Stop upon tap, check partner's elbow

## Expert Insights

### John Danaher
"The triangle to armbar is one of the most fundamental combinations in submission grappling. The opponent's defense of one submission creates the perfect setup for the other. The transition must be smooth - maintain arm control throughout. Apply the armbar with the same progressive pressure principles."

### Gordon Ryan
"I catch a lot of armbars from defended triangles. Opponents focus so much on defending the choke that they forget about their arm. In training, I make sure the transition is controlled. These combination attacks are bread and butter for guard players."

### Eddie Bravo
"Triangle to armbar is fundamental. We drill this combination constantly because it teaches the concept of dilemma creation. Whether traditional triangle or rubber guard variations, the armbar option is always there. Slow, controlled finishing."

## Common Errors

**Error: Losing Arm Control During Transition**
- Releasing triangle before securing arm
- Correction: Control wrist first, then transition legs

**Error: Poor Hip Positioning**
- Hips not under elbow after transition
- Correction: Pivot and create proper angle

**DANGER: Rushing the Transition**
- Explosive movement from triangle to armbar
- **Can cause immediate elbow injury**
- Correction: Smooth transition, pause to establish position, then apply pressure slowly
