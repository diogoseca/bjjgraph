## Description
The Ezekiel Choke (also known as Sode Guruma Jime in Judo) is a versatile sleeve choke that can be executed from multiple positions, making it one of the most adaptable submissions in grappling. This technique applies direct pressure to the opponent's trachea and/or carotid arteries through a unique sleeve-assisted grip configuration. The choke utilizes one arm wrapped around the opponent's head combined with the other hand inserted into the first arm's sleeve, creating a powerful cross-cutting pressure against the neck. Unlike many submissions that require specific dominant positions, the Ezekiel can be applied from traditionally disadvantageous positions such as bottom mount or even within an opponent's guard, making it both a primary attack and an excellent defensive counter-submission. The technique's efficiency, adaptability, and high success rate across skill levels have made it a staple in both gi and no-gi grappling (with appropriate modifications).

## Execution Steps
1. Secure head/neck control by wrapping one arm around opponent's head
2. Insert other hand into the sleeve of the wrapping arm (in gi) or create C-grip with thumb (in no-gi)
3. Position choking arm with forearm pressed against one side of opponent's neck
4. Place sleeve-inserted hand (or C-grip hand) against opposite side of neck
5. Create initial compression by bringing both arms together in scissors motion
6. Tighten choke by driving the sleeve-inserted hand forward while pulling back with neck-wrapping arm
7. Adjust angle by controlling opponent's head position if necessary
8. Prevent defensive frames by keeping opponent's head trapped
9. Maintain pressure through potential defensive reactions
10. Apply progressive compression until submission is secured

## Key Details
- **Sleeve Grip**: In gi, insert hand 3-4 inches into opposite sleeve; in no-gi, create tight C-grip
- **Forearm Placement**: Position forearm precisely across one side of neck, targeting carotid artery
- **Hand Position**: Place sleeve-inserted hand or thumb against opposite side of neck
- **Angle Creation**: Align compression to create crossing pressure pattern
- **Head Control**: Maintain control of opponent's head to prevent defensive movement
- **Pressure Vector**: Apply pressure inward and slightly upward for maximum effectiveness
- **Compression Mechanics**: Create scissors action between both arms
- **Defensive Awareness**: Anticipate and counter common escape attempts

## Common Counters
- [[Create Frame]] → [[Space Creation]]
- [[Chin Tuck]] → [[Defensive Posture]]
- [[Hand Fighting]] → [[Grip Prevention]]
- [[Bridge and Roll]] → [[Position Change]]
- [[Arm Trap and Roll]] → [[Position Reversal]]
- [[Forward Pressure]] → [[Defensive Posture]]

## Variants
- Standard Mounted Ezekiel (classic application from mount)
- Side Control Ezekiel (applied from side control)
- Bottom Ezekiel (defensive application from bottom positions)
- No-Gi Ezekiel (using modified grip without sleeve)
- Arm-In Ezekiel (variation with opponent's arm trapped inside)
- Rolling Ezekiel (dynamic application during transitions)
- Standing Ezekiel (rare standing application)
- Reverse Ezekiel (alternative hand positioning)

## Expert Insights
- **Danaher System**: Recognizes the Ezekiel as a highly efficient submission with excellent mechanical properties. Emphasizes precise placement of compression points against the neck structures and the importance of head control to prevent defensive maneuvers. Notes its particular value as a "problem-solving" submission that can be applied from disadvantageous positions.
- **Gordon Ryan**: While primarily known for no-gi expertise, acknowledges the Ezekiel's effectiveness in both gi and no-gi contexts. When employing the technique, focuses on creating inescapable body positioning before applying the choke, preventing common defensive counters through strategic control.
- **Eddie Bravo**: Has adapted the traditional Ezekiel concept for no-gi application within his 10th Planet system. Emphasizes the importance of the modified grip structure without the gi sleeve, focusing on creating the proper compression angle through precise thumb placement and forearm pressure.

## Timing Considerations
- Execute when opponent's defensive awareness is compromised
- Apply as a counter when opponent focuses on other defensive priorities
- Accelerate application if opponent begins recognizing the threat
- Coordinate with opponent's breathing pattern for enhanced effect
- Time application with opponent's movement to enhance effectiveness
- Deploy as surprise attack from disadvantageous positions
- Apply progressive pressure rather than explosive compression

## Setup Connections
- [[Mount]] → [[High Mount Control]] → [[Ezekiel Choke]]
- [[Side Control]] → [[Head Control]] → [[Ezekiel Choke]]
- [[Bottom Mount]] → [[Defensive Frame]] → [[Ezekiel Choke]]
- [[Guard Bottom]] → [[Sleeve Control]] → [[Ezekiel Choke]]
- [[Knee on Belly]] → [[Collar Control]] → [[Ezekiel Choke]]
- [[North-South Position]] → [[Head Wrap]] → [[Ezekiel Choke]]

## Follow-up Options
- [[Transition to Arm Triangle]] (if Ezekiel is defended)
- [[Switch to Baseball Bat Choke]] (if grip configuration changes)
- [[Triangle Opportunity]] (against specific defensive reactions)
- [[Advance to High Mount]] (to increase pressure)
- [[Armbar from Mount]] (if opponent defends by framing)

## Common Errors
- Insufficient sleeve insertion → Loose grip and ineffective compression
- Poor forearm placement → Missed compression points on neck
- Inadequate head control → Defensive mobility
- Relying solely on arm strength → Premature fatigue
- Telegraphing setup → Defensive awareness
- Improper pressure angle → Reduced choking effectiveness

## Performance Tips
- Focus on precise placement of compression points before applying pressure
- Develop forearm strength specifically for choking mechanics
- Practice establishing the choke from multiple positions
- Maintain head control throughout the submission attempt
- Create awareness of common defensive patterns
- Apply with controlled, progressive pressure rather than explosive force
- Train transitions between related choke positions

## Training Approaches
- Isolated technical drilling with progressive resistance
- Positional sparring focused on choke setups from various positions
- Forearm conditioning for choking endurance
- Defensive recognition and response training
- Partner feedback on compression effectiveness
- No-gi grip adaptation training
- Competition-specific training with ruleset considerations

## Historical Context
The Ezekiel Choke originated in Judo, where it's known as Sode Guruma Jime (Sleeve Wheel Constriction). The technique gained its BJJ name from Brazilian judoka Ezequiel Paraguassu, who effectively used this choke against Brazilian jiu-jitsu practitioners in the 1980s. Initially met with surprise by BJJ players who were unfamiliar with this particular judo technique, it has since become fully integrated into the BJJ technical arsenal. The choke's evolution in BJJ has expanded its application beyond the original judo context, with practitioners developing variations that can be executed from virtually any position, including defensive and disadvantageous ones. This adaptive development exemplifies BJJ's technical evolution, taking a traditional technique and expanding its application through innovative positional exploration.

## Conceptual Framework
The Ezekiel Choke exemplifies the principle of "creating submission opportunities from any position" in BJJ, demonstrating how proper technical execution can overcome positional disadvantage. By utilizing sleeve-assisted compression mechanics, the technique creates effective choking pressure even without ideal body positioning, allowing practitioners to threaten submissions from typically defensive positions. The submission demonstrates how creative grip configurations can unlock submission potential in scenarios where conventional attacks would be impossible, expanding the conceptual framework of when and where submissions can be effectively applied.

## Computer Science Analogy
The Ezekiel Choke functions as an "exception handler" in the BJJ state machine, where it provides a submission pathway that operates outside the normal positional hierarchy. This implements a form of "asynchronous execution" where a terminal submission state can be reached regardless of the current positional context, creating unexpected solution paths in otherwise disadvantageous scenarios. The technique exemplifies the concept of "context-independent processing" where specific local conditions (grip configuration and neck access) can override global state disadvantages (inferior position), demonstrating how localized optimization can sometimes produce global results that bypass normal system constraints.
