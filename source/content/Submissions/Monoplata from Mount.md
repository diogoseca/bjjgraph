## LLM Context: Submission Data Structure

**Purpose**: Advanced shoulder lock from mount. HIGH injury risk. Requires advanced skill and exceptional partner trust.

**Setup Requirements Checklist**:
- [ ] Mount (S001) established with secure control
- [ ] Arm trapped under your leg/body
- [ ] Body angle optimized perpendicular
- [ ] Shoulder isolated and rotated
- [ ] Partner can tap verbally clearly
- [ ] Advanced partner with shoulder lock awareness

**Safety Q&A**:
Q: "Application speed?" A: "5-7 seconds minimum, EXTREMELY slow rotation"
Q: "Primary tap signal?" A: "VERBAL - shoulder position may prevent hand tap"
Q: "When to stop?" A: "Immediately at tap, shoulder resistance, or ANY uncertainty"

## ⚠️ SAFETY NOTICE

**EXTREMELY HIGH INJURY RISK - ADVANCED ONLY**

- **Injuries**: Rotator cuff tear (4-12 weeks), labrum tear (surgery, 3-6 months), dislocation (8-16 weeks)
- **Speed**: 5-7 seconds minimum, NEVER rapid rotation
- **Tap**: VERBAL tap is primary signal
- **Release**: Stop all pressure immediately, check shoulder
- **Restriction**: Advanced practitioners only, instructor supervision mandatory

**Remember**: This is one of the most dangerous common techniques. Shoulder careers end with this submission more than any other. Train with extreme caution or don't train it at all.

## Overview

The Monoplata from Mount is an advanced shoulder lock executed from top mount position by trapping the opponent's arm and using body rotation combined with leg pressure to attack the shoulder joint. This variation is particularly dangerous due to your weight advantage from mount making escape difficult for the defending practitioner.

From [[Mount]] (S001), this technique is attempted when the opponent makes defensive framing errors, typically pushing with straight arms or reaching to defend other attacks. The setup requires transitioning from standard mount to a modified position where one arm is isolated.

Success rates are lower than guard-based monoplata due to mount escape opportunities, but injury risk is equally high. This technique should only be practiced by advanced practitioners with extensive shoulder lock experience.

## Execution Steps

**SAFETY REMINDER**: This is ADVANCED ONLY. Apply 5-7 seconds minimum. Verbal tap is PRIMARY signal.

1. **Arm Isolation** (Setup Phase)
   - From mount, opponent frames with right arm
   - Trap arm by sliding your left leg over their shoulder
   - Maintain mount base with right leg
   - Safety: Ensure partner can tap verbally

2. **Position Transition** (Angle Creation)
   - Shift weight to isolate trapped arm
   - Begin rotating body perpendicular
   - Control wrist with your hands
   - Time: 2-3 seconds slow transition

3. **Lock Formation** (Triangle Configuration)
   - Complete body rotation to perpendicular
   - Leg over shoulder controls arm
   - Establish wrist/forearm control
   - Watch for: Partner's awareness, comfort level

4. **Pressure Initiation** (EXTREMELY SLOW)
   - Begin subtle internal rotation of shoulder
   - Apply leg pressure downward on shoulder
   - Pull wrist creating additional rotation
   - Speed: 3-4 seconds progressive increase
   - Monitor: Verbal tap signals, shoulder position

5. **Progressive Application** (Completion Phase)
   - Incrementally increase all pressure points
   - Stop at ANY resistance
   - Listen for verbal tap continuously
   - Time: 2-3 seconds maximum

6. **Release** (Safety Phase)
   - **IMMEDIATE upon tap**: Stop rotation, release arm, dismount
   - Check: "Shoulder okay?"
   - Observe: Range of motion, pain signals
   - Total release time: 3-4 seconds

## Anatomical Targeting & Injury Awareness

**Target**: Shoulder joint (glenohumeral), rotator cuff muscles
**Mechanism**: Internal rotation + extension creates rotator cuff strain
**Injury Timeline**: 1-2 seconds from resistance to damage
**Common Injuries**: Rotator cuff tear (most common), labrum tear (serious), shoulder dislocation (rare, critical)

**Prevention**:
- SLOW application only (5-7 seconds minimum)
- Stop at any resistance point
- Verbal check-ins during drilling
- Advanced partners who understand shoulder locks
- Never in hard rolling

**Warning Signs**: Partner taps (primary), shoulder sound, unusual positioning, extreme distress, ANY uncertainty

## Training Progressions

**Phase 1-2** (Weeks 1-6): Study only, zero pressure, instructor supervised
**Phase 3-4** (Weeks 7-16): Minimal pressure (20-40% max), slow application (10-15 seconds)
**Phase 5-6** (Weeks 17+): Light application (50-60% max), 5-7 seconds minimum, advanced partners only

**CRITICAL**: Many academies ban or restrict this technique. Check with instructor before practicing. Injury risk is VERY HIGH.

## Expert Insights

### John Danaher
> "The monoplata from mount is mechanically sound but practically dangerous. The injury risk-to-benefit ratio makes it a technique I teach only to my most advanced students with explicit safety protocols. Position achievement is the goal, not completion."

### Gordon Ryan
> "I use this in competition rarely. In training, almost never fully applied. The setup is valuable for understanding mount control and transitions, but the finish carries too much injury risk for daily training."

### Eddie Bravo
> "Advanced technique that fits the system but requires maturity and control. Students must earn the right to practice this by demonstrating exceptional safety awareness with other submissions first."

## Common Errors & Safety Violations

**Technical Errors**:
1. Poor arm isolation - arm not fully trapped
2. Incorrect body angle - not perpendicular
3. Losing mount base during transition

**SAFETY ERRORS (CRITICAL)**:
- **DANGER: Rapid Rotation** - causes immediate rotator cuff tears
- **DANGER: Ignoring Verbal Tap** - shoulder position prevents physical tap
- **DANGER: Training in Hard Rolling** - partner cannot defend adequately
- **DANGER: Insufficient Experience** - requires advanced skill and sensitivity

## Knowledge Assessment

1. **Who should practice this technique?** Advanced practitioners only (typically brown/black belt), with instructor supervision, experienced partners, extensive shoulder lock background

2. **Primary tap signal?** VERBAL tap - shoulder position may prevent physical tap. Listen carefully for partner's voice.

3. **Application speed in training?** 5-7 seconds MINIMUM from lock to tap. Drilling should be 10-15 seconds or slower.

4. **What injuries can occur?** Rotator cuff tear (4-12 weeks), labrum tear (surgery, 3-6 months), shoulder dislocation (8-16 weeks), all potentially career-ending.

5. **When should you stop?** Immediately upon: verbal tap, shoulder resistance, any sound from joint, partner distress, ANY uncertainty whatsoever.
