##   CRITICAL SAFETY WARNING

**EXTREMELY HIGH INJURY RISK - ADVANCED PRACTITIONERS ONLY**

This technique involves jumping, falling, and mid-air joint manipulation. Risk of serious injury to BOTH practitioners if executed improperly.

- **Injury Risks**: Elbow dislocation, hyperextension, fall impact injuries, head/neck injuries, partner slam injuries
- **Skill Requirement**: ADVANCED ONLY - requires breakfall training
- **Training Environment**: Heavy mat padding, instructor supervision MANDATORY
- **Application Speed**: In drilling: 10+ seconds, controlled entry. NEVER at full speed in practice.
- **Critical**: Partner must know how to breakfall. Both practitioners at risk.

**IMPORTANT**: This technique is NOT recommended for regular drilling. Competitive/demonstration context only. High risk of career-ending injuries if done incorrectly.

## Overview

The Standing Armbar (Juji Gatame) is a spectacular but extremely high-risk submission involving a jumping or flying entry to armbar configuration from standing. While visually impressive, it carries significant injury risk for both the attacker (landing) and defender (arm injury, slam risk).

This technique is included for completeness but should only be practiced by advanced practitioners with proper supervision, heavy mats, and both partners having excellent breakfall skills.

### Submission Properties

From [[Standing Neutral]] (S001):

**Success Rates**: Beginner 20% (NOT RECOMMENDED), Intermediate 40%, Advanced 60%

**Characteristics**: Very high setup complexity, CRITICAL damage potential, extreme risk for both practitioners.

## Execution Steps (Conceptual - Not for Casual Practice)

1. **Standing Control**: Secure arm control from standing clinch or grip fight
2. **Entry Setup**: Create angle and momentum for jump
3. **Jumping Entry**: Jump and swing legs around arm/head
4. **Mid-Air Position**: Configure body for armbar while airborne
5. **Controlled Landing**: Land on back safely, protect partner's landing
6. **Position Refinement**: Adjust armbar configuration on ground
7. **Progressive Pressure**: Apply SLOW pressure (10+ seconds in drilling)
8. **Safety Release**: Release upon tap, check both practitioners for injury

**CRITICAL NOTE**: Steps 2-5 require extensive practice with crash mats and supervision. Never attempt without proper training.

## Expert Insights

### John Danaher
"The flying armbar is mechanically impressive but carries enormous risk. In competition, if you have the skill and timing, it can be effective. In training, I strongly recommend against it except with elite partners on excellent mats. The risk-reward is poor for regular training. Focus on higher-percentage, safer submissions."

### Gordon Ryan
"I've hit flying armbars in competition, but I practiced them for years with world-class training partners. In regular training, I don't go for them. The injury risk to my partner and myself isn't worth it. There are safer ways to finish matches."

### Eddie Bravo
"Flying submissions look cool, but safety comes first. We drill entries very slowly with crash pads. Most practitioners should focus on ground-based submissions. If you're going to train flying attacks, do it right - proper mats, proper supervision, proper training progression."

## Common Errors & Dangers

**DANGER: Attempting Without Proper Training**
- Jumping for armbar without breakfall skills
- **Extremely high injury risk - head/neck/spine**
- Correction: DON'T ATTEMPT without advanced training

**DANGER: Partner Cannot Breakfall**
- Attempting on partner without ukemi skills
- **Risk of arm injury AND landing injury**
- Correction: Only with advanced partners

**DANGER: Inadequate Mats**
- Attempting on standard mats
- **Impact injury risk**
- Correction: Crash mats or heavy padding required

**DANGER: Explosive Application**
- Applying armbar pressure while landing/falling
- **Immediate dislocation/break possible**
- Correction: Land FIRST, establish control, THEN apply pressure slowly

## Training Progression

**Prerequisite Skills Required**:
- 3+ years BJJ experience minimum
- Breakfall proficiency (both practitioners)
- Standard armbar mastery
- Standing control and entries
- Athletic ability and body awareness

**Progression (Months/Years)**:
1. Master ground-based armbars (6+ months)
2. Practice breakfalls extensively (ongoing)
3. Drill entry mechanics with crash mats (3+ months)
4. Slow controlled entries with supervision (3+ months)
5. Progressive speed increase (6+ months)
6. Live application only in competition if needed

**Strong Recommendation**: Most practitioners should skip this technique entirely. Risk exceeds benefit for training purposes.
