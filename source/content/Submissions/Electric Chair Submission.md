## State Machine Content Elements

### Visual Execution Sequence
Detailed step-by-step description for clear movement sequence visualization:

From the Electric Chair position or Lockdown Guard, you start by securing full control with a lockdown on the opponent's trapped leg, ensuring maximum tension to isolate their lower body. With your outside hand, grip their free ankle or foot tightly to prevent escape, while your inside arm controls their upper body by gripping their collar or shoulder to limit their rotation. Turn your body slightly away from the opponent to create an optimal angle, then initiate the submission by pushing their free leg across their body while simultaneously pulling their upper body in the opposite direction, creating a powerful stretching pressure on their inner thigh and groin. Elevate your hips to intensify the stretch across the adductor muscles and hip joint, maintaining control through their defensive reactions and adjusting angles as needed until the opponent submits due to the overwhelming discomfort and potential for injury.

**Template**: "From Electric Chair, secure lockdown on trapped leg. Grip free ankle with outside hand and control upper body with inside arm. Turn slightly away, push free leg across, pull upper body opposite. Elevate hips to intensify stretch until submission."

### Execution Steps (Numbered Sequence)
1. **Setup Requirements**: Establish control in Electric Chair or Lockdown Guard
2. **Initial Movement**: Secure lockdown on opponent's trapped leg with maximum tension
3. **Opponent Response**: Opponent may attempt to posture or escape grip
4. **Adaptation**: Grip opponent's free ankle/foot with outside hand for control
5. **Positioning**: Control upper body with inside arm (collar or shoulder grip)
6. **Pressure Application**: Turn slightly away, push free leg across, pull upper body opposite
7. **Completion**: Elevate hips to intensify stretch on inner thigh/groin until submission

### Key Technical Details
Critical elements that determine success:
- **Grip Requirements**: Strong grip on opponent's free ankle/foot
- **Base/Foundation**: Stable lockdown position for leverage and control
- **Timing Windows**: Execute after secure Electric Chair establishment
- **Leverage Points**: Hip elevation and opposing force vectors for stretch
- **Common Adjustments**: Adjust body angle and hip height based on resistance

### Success Modifiers
Factors that increase/decrease probability:
- **Setup Quality**: Security of lockdown and grip control (+/-20%)
- **Timing Precision**: Executing before opponent defends posture (+/-15%)
- **Opponent Fatigue**: Reduced defensive mobility over time (+/-5%)
- **Knowledge Test Performance**: Understanding stretch mechanics (+/-10%)
- **Hip Elevation**: Effectiveness of hip lift for pressure (+/-10%)

## Counter-Attack Analysis

### Common Counters
Opponent responses with success rates:
- **Posture and Base**: Maintaining strong posture to resist stretch → [[Submission Defense]] (Success Rate: 30%, Conditions: early reaction)
- **Hip Escape**: Shrimping to reduce pressure angle → [[Pressure Reduction]] (Success Rate: 25%, Conditions: significant space)
- **Whizzer Control**: Overhooking arm to prevent angle → [[Angle Prevention]] (Success Rate: 20%, Conditions: strong grip)
- **Free Trapped Leg**: Breaking lockdown control → [[Control Escape]] (Success Rate: 15%, Conditions: mobility available)
- **Forward Drive**: Driving forward to flatten position → [[Flattening Counter]] (Success Rate: 10%, Conditions: quick anticipation)

Format: `[[Counter Technique]] → [[Result State]] (Success Rate: X%, Conditions: [when applicable])`

### Decision Logic for Opponent Behavior
```
If [electric chair control] is not fully secured:
- Execute [[Posture and Base]] (Probability: 30%)

Else if [space] can be created:
- Execute [[Hip Escape]] (Probability: 25%)

Else if [grip strength] allows overhooking:
- Execute [[Whizzer Control]] (Probability: 20%)

Else if [body mobility] permits leg freedom:
- Execute [[Free Trapped Leg]] (Probability: 15%)

Else [optimal submission execution]:
- Accept submission (Probability: Success Rate - Modifiers)
```

## Defensive Considerations

### Common Threats During Attempt
Primary risks while attempting this submission:
- **Grip Break**: Opponent breaks ankle/foot control → [[Control Escape]] (Threat Level: Medium)
- **Position Loss**: Opponent escapes lockdown during setup → [[Position Change]] (Threat Level: Medium)
- **Counter Attack**: Opponent initiates forward drive to flatten → [[Flattening Counter]] (Threat Level: Low)
- **Stalemate**: Opponent maintains posture to stall stretch → [[Submission Defense]] (Threat Level: Medium)

Format: `[[Threat Type]] → [[Resulting Position]] (Threat Level: X)`

### Defensive Strategies
Methods to mitigate threats:
- **Grip Maintenance**: Secure tight grip on ankle/foot quickly to prevent breaks
- **Position Control**: Maintain stable lockdown to avoid escapes
- **Hip Elevation**: Maximize stretch early to limit defensive options
