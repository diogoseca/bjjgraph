##   SAFETY NOTICE

**HIGH INJURY RISK - ELBOW AND SHOULDER**

This technique involves rolling with arm control. Risk of elbow hyperextension AND shoulder stress. Apply SLOW pressure. Rolling motion must be controlled.

- **Injury Risks**: Elbow hyperextension, ligament damage, shoulder stress during roll
- **Application**: 3-5 seconds minimum, controlled rolling motion
- **Critical**: Partner must be able to roll safely. Watch for shoulder stress during transition.

## Overview

The Armbar from Turtle position (often called rolling armbar) is an advanced submission that capitalizes on the opponent's arm positioning when they're in turtle. The technique typically involves isolating an arm and rolling to armbar position, requiring good timing and spatial awareness.

### Submission Properties

From [[Turtle Position Top]] (S050):

**Success Rates**: Beginner 25%, Intermediate 45%, Advanced 65%

**Characteristics**: High setup complexity, requires rolling mechanics, high damage potential.

## Execution Steps

1. **Turtle Control**: Establish top control of turtle position
2. **Arm Isolation**: Capture extended or posted arm
3. **Grip Control**: Secure wrist with both hands, control elbow
4. **Hip Position**: Position hips and body for roll
5. **Controlled Roll**: Roll to back, bringing opponent's arm with you
6. **Armbar Configuration**: Establish leg position and hip angle during/after roll
7. **Progressive Pressure**: Apply slow hip extension (3-5 seconds)
8. **Release**: Stop upon tap, ensure both practitioners are safe

**CRITICAL**: Rolling motion must be controlled. Explosive rolling can injure both practitioners.

## Expert Insights

### John Danaher
"The rolling armbar from turtle requires excellent technical execution. The roll must be controlled to avoid injuring the opponent's shoulder during the transition. Once the armbar is established, apply pressure progressively. This is an advanced technique requiring significant mat time to master safely."

### Gordon Ryan
"Turtle armbars are high-risk, high-reward. When I get one in competition, it's because the timing was perfect. In training, I'm extra careful with the rolling motion. It's easy to stress their shoulder if you roll too fast or at the wrong angle."

### Eddie Bravo
"We have multiple turtle attacks in 10th Planet. The armbar is one option, back take is another. Whichever attack you choose from turtle, control the motion. Turtle is dynamic - stay controlled, stay safe."

## Common Errors

**Error: Poor Arm Control During Roll**
- Losing grip during rolling transition
- Correction: Secure arm with strong grips before rolling

**Error: Wrong Rolling Direction**
- Rolling away from controlled arm
- Correction: Roll toward the trapped arm side

**DANGER: Explosive Rolling**
- Fast, uncontrolled roll with arm trapped
- **Can cause shoulder and elbow injury**
- Correction: Controlled, smooth rolling motion

**DANGER: Applying Pressure During Roll**
- Extending hips while still rolling
- **Risk of injury during transition**
- Correction: Complete roll, establish position, THEN apply pressure
