#bjj #transition #submission #finish

## Transition Properties
- **Transition ID**: T101
- **Starting State**: [[Triangle Control]]
- **Ending State**: [[Won by Submission]]
- **Success Probability**: Beginner (40%), Intermediate (65%), Advanced (85%)
- **Execution Complexity**: Medium
- **Physical Attributes**: Leg strength (High), Hip mobility (Medium)

## Transition Description
The Triangle Finish is the culmination of the triangle choke setup, where proper positioning and technique application lead to a complete blood choke. When executed correctly, pressure on both carotid arteries disrupts blood flow to the brain, forcing the opponent to submit or risk unconsciousness.

## Execution Steps
1. Ensure perpendicular angle to opponent
2. Secure figure-four lock with legs (one ankle behind knee, other ankle in front of shin)
3. Pull down on opponent's head or arm to close space
4. Squeeze legs together while lifting hips
5. Focus pressure on opponent's carotid arteries, not windpipe
6. Maintain control until submission or referee stoppage

## Key Grips/Controls
- Figure-four leg control
- Head control (pulling down)
- Trapped arm control
- Posture control (preventing opponent from stacking)
- Hip positioning (lifting to increase pressure)

## Common Counters
- [[Posture Defense]] → [[Triangle Escape Position]]
- [[Stack Counter]] → [[Position Reset]]
- [[Defensive Arm Position]] → [[Triangle Stall]]
- [[Roll Through]] → [[Guard Pass]]

## Variants
- Triangle with arm manipulation (S-grip on wrist)
- Triangle with shoulder pressure
- Triangle with opposite arm trapped
- Triangle with wrist control
- Cutting angle triangle (extreme perpendicular position)

## Expert Insights
- **Danaher System**: Emphasizes the mechanical perfection of the triangle, focusing on incremental adjustments to eliminate defensive space. The transition from control to finish should be methodical, not rushed, ensuring all defensive avenues are closed before applying maximum pressure.
- **Gordon Ryan**: Combines the triangle finish with wrist control variations, using subtle manipulations of the opponent's trapped arm to increase choke effectiveness. Often uses small hip adjustments rather than maximum leg squeezing to perfect the choking angle.
- **Eddie Bravo**: Focuses on the "cut the angle" principle, emphasizing extreme perpendicular positioning before squeezing. Incorporates specific shoulder positioning and head control grips unique to the 10th Planet system.

## Timing Considerations
- Apply finish when opponent's defensive frames are neutralized
- Increase pressure gradually, not in a sudden burst
- Adjust timing based on opponent's breathing cycle
- Pause and readjust if initial pressure doesn't produce immediate results

## Follow-up Options
- If submission fails, transition to [[Armbar Control]]
- If submission fails, transition to [[Omoplata Control]]
- If submission fails, transition to [[Triangle to Mount]]
