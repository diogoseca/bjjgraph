# Triangle Finish
#bjj #transition #submission #finish #choke

## Required Properties for State Machine

### Core Identifiers
- **Submission ID**: S101
- **Submission Name**: Triangle Finish
- **Alternative Names**: Triangle Choke Finish, Sankaku Jime Finish

### State Machine Properties
- **Starting State**: [[Triangle Control]]
- **Ending State**: [[Won by Submission]]
- **Submission Type**: Choke - Targets carotid arteries

## ⚠️ Safety Considerations

### Injury Risks
Triangle chokes can cause serious injuries if finished incorrectly:
- **Loss of Consciousness** (Severity: High, Recovery: Minutes to hours) - Blood chokes cause unconsciousness in 3-8 seconds if held after tap
- **Carotid Artery Damage** (Severity: Critical, Recovery: Weeks to permanent) - Excessive or prolonged pressure can damage blood vessels
- **Neck Strain** (Severity: Medium, Recovery: 1-3 weeks) - Pulling head too aggressively during finish can strain cervical muscles
- **Trachea Damage** (Severity: High, Recovery: 2-6 weeks) - Improper leg position can crush windpipe instead of compressing carotids

### Application Speed
- Apply triangle finish SLOWLY and progressively over 3-5 seconds minimum
- Never "spike" or explosively squeeze the triangle closed
- Maintain constant awareness of partner's tap signals and face color
- Gradually increase leg squeeze and hip lift pressure

### Tap Signals
Partners must establish clear tap signals before training triangle finishes:
- **Verbal Tap**: Saying "tap" or "stop" loudly and clearly
- **Physical Tap**: Tapping partner's leg, body, or mat with free hand (minimum 2 taps)
- **Emergency Signal**: Multiple rapid taps or any sign of distress if unable to tap normally

### Release Protocol
When partner taps:
1. Immediately stop all squeezing pressure from legs
2. Release hip lift and leg squeeze simultaneously
3. Unlock the figure-four configuration around their neck
4. Allow partner to breathe freely and monitor for 10-15 seconds

### Training Progression
- **Weeks 1-2**: Triangle position control only, no finishing pressure
- **Weeks 3-4**: Slow-motion finishes (10% speed), partner taps at 20% pressure
- **Weeks 5-8**: Medium speed finishes (50% speed), partner taps at 50% pressure
- **Ongoing**: Full-speed finishes only with experienced partners who trust your control

### Partner Communication
- Establish tap awareness before drilling triangle finishes
- Discuss any neck or throat sensitivity issues before training
- Verbal check-ins during drilling: "Pressure okay?" to monitor partner status
- Watch for color changes in partner's face indicating blood flow restriction

### Submission Properties
- **Success Probability**: Beginner 40%, Intermediate 65%, Advanced 85% - core probability data
- **Execution Complexity**: Medium - technical difficulty assessment
- **Energy Cost**: Medium - physical demand of execution
- **Time Required**: Short to Medium - duration of submission attempt
- **Risk Level**: Medium - chance of position loss if failed

### Physical Requirements
- **Strength Requirements**: High for leg squeeze and hip lift
- **Flexibility Requirements**: Medium for hip mobility and leg positioning
- **Coordination Requirements**: Medium for precise leg and arm alignment
- **Endurance Requirements**: Medium for sustained pressure during finish

### Visual Execution Sequence
Detailed step-by-step description for clear movement sequence visualization:

From the Triangle Control position, you start by ensuring a perpendicular angle to your opponent, positioning your body to maximize leverage with one of their arms and their head trapped between your legs. Secure a figure-four lock by tucking one ankle behind the knee of your other leg, creating a tight frame around their neck and arm to restrict blood flow. Pull down on their head or trapped arm to eliminate any defensive space, ensuring their posture remains broken and their ability to escape is minimized. Squeeze your legs together while lifting your hips upward, focusing the pressure on their carotid arteries rather than their windpipe, maintaining this control and progressively increasing the choke until they submit due to the disruption of blood flow to the brain.

**Template**: "From Triangle Control, align perpendicular, trap arm and head. Lock figure-four with legs. Pull head or arm down, close space. Squeeze legs, lift hips for carotid pressure until submission."

### Execution Steps (Numbered Sequence)
1. **Setup Requirements**: Establish position (Triangle Control)
2. **Initial Movement**: Align body perpendicular to opponent for leverage
3. **Opponent Response**: Opponent may attempt to posture up or stack
4. **Adaptation**: Secure figure-four lock with one ankle behind knee
5. **Positioning**: Pull down on head or arm to eliminate defensive space
6. **Pressure Application**: Squeeze legs together, lift hips for carotid pressure
7. **Completion**: Maintain control, apply progressive pressure until submission

### Key Technical Details
Critical elements that determine success:
- **Grip Requirements**: Control of head or arm to close defensive space
- **Base/Foundation**: Figure-four leg lock for tight frame around neck
- **Timing Windows**: Execute when opponent's posture is broken or defenses neutralized
- **Leverage Points**: Hip lift and leg squeeze for carotid compression
- **Common Adjustments**: Adjust angle and pressure based on defensive posture

### Success Modifiers
Factors that increase/decrease probability:
- **Setup Quality**: Security of figure-four lock and angle alignment (+/-20%)
- **Timing Precision**: Executing during opponent's posture break (+/-15%)
- **Opponent Fatigue**: Reduced defensive posture over time (+/-5%)
- **Knowledge Test Performance**: Understanding carotid choke mechanics (+/-10%)
- **Positional Control**: Effectiveness of head or arm control (+/-10%)

## Counter-Attack Analysis

### Common Counters
Opponent responses with success rates:
- **Posture Defense**: Maintaining strong posture to avoid choke → [[Triangle Escape Position]] (Success Rate: 25%, Conditions: early reaction)
- **Stack Counter**: Stacking to disrupt angle and pressure → [[Position Reset]] (Success Rate: 20%, Conditions: strong base)
- **Defensive Arm Position**: Positioning arm to block choke → [[Triangle Stall]] (Success Rate: 15%, Conditions: quick adjustment)
- **Roll Through**: Rolling to escape triangle frame → [[Guard Pass]] (Success Rate: 10%, Conditions: significant leverage)
- **Hip Escape**: Escaping hips to reduce pressure → [[Pressure Reduction]] (Success Rate: 10%, Conditions: quick movement)

Format: `[[Counter Technique]] → [[Result State]] (Success Rate: X%, Conditions: [when applicable])`

### Decision Logic for Opponent Behavior
```
If [triangle finish setup] is not fully secured:
- Execute [[Posture Defense]] (Probability: 25%)

Else if [stack counter] can disrupt angle:
- Execute [[Stack Counter]] (Probability: 20%)

Else if [defensive arm position] blocks choke:
- Execute [[Defensive Arm Position]] (Probability: 15%)

Else if [roll through] escapes frame:
- Execute [[Roll Through]] (Probability: 10%)

Else [optimal submission execution]:
- Accept submission (Probability: Success Rate - Modifiers)
```

## Defensive Considerations

### Common Threats During Attempt
Primary risks while attempting this submission:
- **Posture Break**: Opponent maintains posture to avoid choke → [[Triangle Escape Position]] (Threat Level: Medium)
- **Stacking Defense**: Opponent stacks to disrupt angle → [[Position Reset]] (Threat Level: Medium)
- **Arm Defense**: Opponent positions arm to block choke → [[Triangle Stall]] (Threat Level: Low)
- **Counter Attack**: Opponent rolls or escapes → [[Guard Pass]] (Threat Level: Low)

Format: `[[Threat Type]] → [[Resulting Position]] (Threat Level: X)`

### Defensive Strategies
Methods to mitigate threats:
- **Angle Maintenance**: Keep perpendicular alignment to prevent posture defense
- **Leg Control**: Secure tight figure-four lock to counter stacking
- **Head Control**: Pull head or arm down to block defensive positioning
- **Hip Pressure**: Maintain hip lift to counter escape attempts
- **Adaptation Readiness**: Be prepared to switch to armbar or omoplata if defended

## Educational Content

### Expert Insights
Commentary as if from recognized authorities:
- **John Danaher**: "Triangle Finish requires mechanical perfection. Incremental adjustments eliminate defensive space. It’s a methodical blood choke."
- **Gordon Ryan**: "I use wrist control in Triangle Finish. Small hip adjustments perfect the angle. It’s a systematic carotid attack."
- **Eddie Bravo**: "Cut the angle in Triangle Finish. Extreme perpendicular positioning maximizes pressure. Shoulder and head control are key."

Each insight should focus on one key technical or strategic element.

### Common Errors
For knowledge test generation:
- **Error**: Incorrect angle alignment with opponent
- **Why It Fails**: Reduces leverage and choke effectiveness on carotids
- **Correction**: Ensure perpendicular positioning for optimal pressure
- **Recognition**: Pressure feels weak despite leg lock

- **Error**: Insufficient head or arm control
- **Why It Fails**: Allows opponent to create defensive space and escape
- **Correction**: Pull head or arm down to close all gaps
- **Recognition**: Opponent postures up during choke attempt

- **Error**: Focusing pressure on windpipe instead of carotids
- **Why It Fails**: Turns choke into pain move rather than blood choke
- **Correction**: Adjust leg squeeze to target carotid arteries
- **Recognition**: Opponent resists longer without submitting

### Timing Considerations
When to attempt this submission:
- **Optimal Conditions**: When opponent's defensive frames are neutralized
- **Avoid When**: Opponent maintains strong posture or stacking defense
- **Setup Sequences**: As finishing move from Triangle Control position
