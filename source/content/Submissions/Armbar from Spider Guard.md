##   SAFETY NOTICE

**SERIOUS ELBOW INJURY RISK** - Apply SLOW progressive pressure over 3-5 seconds. Release immediately upon tap. Elbow injuries can be permanent.

## Overview

The Armbar from Spider Guard leverages the arm extension created by spider guard hooks. With sleeve grips and foot pressure, the opponent's arm is already in a compromised position, making the transition to armbar natural and high-percentage.

### Submission Properties

From [[Spider Guard Bottom]] (S040):

**Success Rates**: Beginner 35%, Intermediate 55%, Advanced 75%

**Characteristics**: Medium setup complexity, high damage potential. Gi-specific technique.

## Execution Steps

1. **Spider Guard Setup**: Establish spider hooks with sleeve grips
2. **Arm Extension**: Use foot on bicep to extend opponent's arm
3. **Grip Adjustment**: Secure wrist with both hands
4. **Leg Transition**: Swing free leg over for armbar configuration
5. **Hip Position**: Create angle, position hips under elbow
6. **Progressive Pressure**: Slowly extend hips over 3-5 seconds
7. **Release**: Stop upon tap, check partner's elbow

## Expert Insights

### John Danaher
"Spider guard creates natural armbar opportunities because the opponent's arms are already extended. The transition is about maintaining control while changing leg configuration. Progressive pressure is essential."

### Gordon Ryan
"Spider armbars are high-percentage in gi. The sleeve grip gives excellent control. In training, take time to adjust position properly before applying pressure. The gi makes it easy to control, so be extra careful."

### Eddie Bravo
"We don't use traditional spider in 10th Planet no-gi, but the principle transfers - extend their arm, attack the elbow. Whether gi or no-gi, safety is non-negotiable."

## Common Errors

**Error: Losing Sleeve Control**
- Releasing grip too early in transition
- Correction: Maintain grip throughout

**DANGER: Explosive Application**
- Jerking hips to finish quickly
- **Can cause immediate ligament damage**
- Correction: 3-5 second progressive application
