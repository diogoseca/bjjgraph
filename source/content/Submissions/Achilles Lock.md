## ⚠️ SAFETY NOTICE

**ACHILLES TENDON RUPTURE RISK - This is a HIGH-RISK submission.**

- **Critical Risk**: Achilles tendon can rupture with minimal warning - often requires surgery
- **Application Speed**: VERY SLOW (4-6 seconds minimum). Never fast.
- **Tap Early**: Partners must tap at first sign of Achilles pain
- **Release Protocol**: Immediately stop all pressure, check tendon integrity

**Remember**: Achilles injuries are career-threatening. This submission requires exceptional control and trust.

## Overview

The Achilles lock applies direct compression to the Achilles tendon using the blade of the forearm while securing the foot. Unlike the straight ankle lock which hyperextends the joint, this variation crushes the tendon itself - making it more dangerous.

From [[Ashi Garami]], position the blade of your forearm directly on the Achilles tendon and use wrist flexion to compress it while maintaining ankle extension. The combination creates intense pressure on the tendon. Success rates: Beginner 30%, Intermediate 50%, Advanced 65%.

**CRITICAL**: This submission has higher injury risk than standard ankle locks. Many instructors prohibit it in training.

## Expert Insights

### John Danaher
> "The Achilles lock adds compressive force to extension mechanics. The forearm blade positioned precisely on the Achilles creates direct tendon pressure. This makes it more effective but also more dangerous - the tendon can rupture before pain signals adequately warn the defender. In training, if you use this variation at all, apply with extreme caution."

### Gordon Ryan
> "I rarely use pure Achilles locks in training because the injury risk is high. The tendon is vulnerable, and people don't always feel it until it's too late. Competition is different, but in the gym, I prefer standard ankle locks that give better feedback."

### Eddie Bravo
> "The Achilles compression is nasty. We teach it so students understand the mechanics, but we emphasize: this is not for regular training. The risk-reward isn't there. Stick to standard ankle locks in the gym."

## Knowledge Assessment

1. **Why Higher Risk**: Achilles compression can cause rupture before adequate pain signals - less feedback than joint locks
2. **Mechanics**: Forearm blade compresses Achilles + wrist flexion + ankle extension = tendon crushing
3. **Safety Protocol**: VERY slow application (4-6 seconds), tap at first Achilles discomfort, many prohibit in training
4. **Injury Severity**: Achilles rupture often requires surgery, 4-6 months recovery, may never fully heal
5. **Training Approach**: Position-only drilling recommended, or avoid entirely in favor of standard ankle locks
6. **Defense**: Early leg extraction (60%), tap immediately when Achilles pressure felt (100% necessary)
