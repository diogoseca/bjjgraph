## ⚠️ SAFETY NOTICE

**This submission can cause LOSS OF CONSCIOUSNESS if applied improperly.**

- **Injury Risks**: Loss of consciousness (5-10 seconds), neck strain, airway compression
- **Application Speed**: SLOW and progressive. 3-5 seconds minimum from setup to tap.
- **Tap Signals**: Verbal "tap", physical tap with hands or feet
- **Release Protocol**: Release choking arm immediately, remove forearm from neck, return to mount, monitor partner
- **Training Requirement**: Beginner level with gi training experience
- **Never**: Apply explosively or maintain pressure after tap

**Remember**: Ezekiel is deceptively powerful. Apply slowly despite the simple setup. Your training partner trusts you.

## Overview

The Ezekiel Choke from [[Mount]] is one of the most fundamental gi chokes in Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu. It uses the practitioner's own gi sleeve as a handle to create a sliding choking pressure across the opponent's neck, attacking the carotid arteries.

The technique is notable for being executable from a dominant position (mount) without sacrificing positional control. The setup appears simple but requires precise angle and pressure to function as a blood choke rather than an uncomfortable air choke.

**Success Rates**: Beginner 35%, Intermediate 55%, Advanced 75%
