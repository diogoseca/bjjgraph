## State Machine Content Elements

### Visual Execution Sequence
Detailed step-by-step description for clear movement sequence visualization:

From a leg entanglement position such as Inside Sankaku (also known as Honey Hole or 411), Ashi Garami, or 50-50 Guard, initiate the Inside Heel Hook by securing control over the opponent's leg, isolating their hip to prevent defensive rotation, and establishing a figure-four grip on their heel with your arms. Position your legs to maintain the knee line, ensuring the opponent's knee is aligned for rotational pressure, with your inside leg often trapping their thigh and your outside leg controlling their hip or ankle. Grip the heel tightly, ensuring the heel is exposed and not hidden by their other leg, using your hands to pull it towards your chest or shoulder to create leverage. Apply rotational force by turning your body or hips, directing pressure inward to torque the knee and ankle joints, while keeping their hip immobilized to prevent escape. Maintain this control and increase the rotational pressure steadily until the opponent submits due to the intense strain on the knee ligaments.

**Template**: "From Inside Sankaku or similar, isolate leg and hip, secure figure-four heel grip. Position legs for knee line control, trap thigh and hip. Grip heel tightly, pull towards chest. Apply inward rotational force with body turn until submission."

### Execution Steps (Numbered Sequence)
1. **Setup Requirements**: Establish leg entanglement ([[Inside Sankaku]], [[Ashi Garami]], [[50-50 Guard]])
2. **Initial Movement**: Isolate opponent's hip and secure figure-four grip on heel
3. **Opponent Response**: Opponent may attempt to rotate knee or hide heel
4. **Adaptation**: Position legs to maintain knee line, trap thigh and control hip
5. **Positioning**: Grip heel tightly, pull towards chest or shoulder for leverage
6. **Pressure Application**: Apply inward rotational force by turning body or hips
7. **Completion**: Increase rotational pressure until submission

### Key Technical Details
Critical elements that determine success:
- **Grip Requirements**: Secure figure-four grip on heel to prevent slipping
- **Base/Foundation**: Leg positioning to maintain knee line and hip control
- **Timing Windows**: Execute when opponent's leg is entangled and hip isolated
- **Leverage Points**: Rotational torque on knee and ankle via heel grip
- **Common Adjustments**: Adjust grip and body angle based on defensive rotations

### Success Modifiers
Factors that increase/decrease probability:
- **Setup Quality**: Security of heel grip and hip isolation (+/-20%)
- **Timing Precision**: Executing when leg is entangled and hip isolated (+/-15%)
- **Opponent Fatigue**: Reduced defensive mobility over time (+/-5%)
- **Knowledge Test Performance**: Understanding heel hook mechanics (+/-10%)
- **Positional Control**: Effectiveness of knee line maintenance (+/-10%)

## Counter-Attack Analysis

### Common Counters
Opponent responses with success rates:
- **Knee Rotation Outward**: Rotating knee outward to relieve pressure → [[Rotation Defense]] (Success Rate: 25%, Conditions: early reaction)
- **Heel Hiding**: Tucking foot to hide heel → [[Heel Protection]] (Success Rate: 20%, Conditions: quick adjustment)
- **Hip Elevation**: Bridging to create space → [[Space Creation]] (Success Rate: 15%, Conditions: strong base)
- **Standing Attempt**: Standing to escape entanglement → [[Position Escape]] (Success Rate: 10%, Conditions: explosive movement)
- **Leg Extension**: Extending leg to reduce torque → [[Extension Defense]] (Success Rate: 10%, Conditions: immediate action)

Format: `[[Counter Technique]] → [[Result State]] (Success Rate: X%, Conditions: [when applicable])`

### Decision Logic for Opponent Behavior
```
If [inside heel hook setup] is not fully secured:
- Execute [[Knee Rotation Outward]] (Probability: 25%)

Else if [heel hiding] protects heel:
- Execute [[Heel Hiding]] (Probability: 20%)

Else if [hip elevation] creates space:
- Execute [[Hip Elevation]] (Probability: 15%)

Else if [standing attempt] escapes entanglement:
- Execute [[Standing Attempt]] (Probability: 10%)

Else [optimal submission execution]:
- Accept submission (Probability: Success Rate - Modifiers)
```

## Defensive Considerations

### Common Threats During Attempt
Primary risks while attempting this submission:
- **Rotation Defense**: Opponent rotates knee outward → [[Rotation Defense]] (Threat Level: Medium)
- **Heel Protection**: Opponent hides heel → [[Heel Protection]] (Threat Level: Medium)
- **Space Creation**: Opponent bridges to create space → [[Space Creation]] (Threat Level: Low)
- **Position Escape**: Opponent stands to escape → [[Position Escape]] (Threat Level: Low)

Format: `[[Threat Type]] → [[Resulting Position]] (Threat Level: X)`

### Defensive Strategies
Methods to mitigate threats:
- **Heel Grip**: Maintain tight grip on heel to prevent hiding
- **Hip Control**: Keep opponent's hip immobilized to counter rotation
- **Knee Line**: Secure knee line with legs to block bridging
- **Entanglement Maintenance**: Adjust entanglement to prevent standing escape
- **Adaptation Readiness**: Be prepared to switch to other leg locks if heel hook fails

## Educational Content

### Expert Insights
Commentary as if from recognized authorities:
- **John Danaher**: "The Inside Heel Hook is central to my leg lock system, emphasizing control before submission. Establishing dominant entanglement like Inside Sankaku maximizes control and minimizes defensive options."
- **Gordon Ryan**: "I focus on patient control in heel hook positions, waiting for subtle defensive errors. Transitions between Inside Sankaku and 50-50 create seamless adjustments for the submission."
- **Eddie Bravo**: "In 10th Planet, heel hooks are transitional threats to set up upper body attacks. I emphasize unorthodox entries that integrate with my overall system."

Each insight should focus on one key technical or strategic element.

### Common Errors
For knowledge test generation:
- **Error**: Poor heel grip or exposure
- **Why It Fails**: Allows opponent to hide heel or escape grip
- **Correction**: Secure figure-four grip and maintain heel exposure
- **Recognition**: Heel slips out during rotational attempt

- **Error**: Insufficient hip isolation
- **Why It Fails**: Permits opponent to rotate or escape entanglement
- **Correction**: Control opponent's hip with leg positioning
- **Recognition**: Opponent easily rotates knee or stands up

- **Error**: Incorrect rotational direction or leverage
- **Why It Fails**: Reduces torque on knee and ankle, weakening submission
- **Correction**: Apply inward rotation with body turn for maximum pressure
- **Recognition**: Submission feels ineffective despite heel grip

### Tactical Applications
Strategic uses of the submission:
- **Primary Leg Attack**: Main submission from leg entanglement positions
- **Defensive Counter**: Effective against guard passes or sweeps
- **Positional Control**: Maintains control and forces defensive reactions
- **Chain Setup**: Sets up other heel hook variations or leg locks
- **Psychological Pressure**: Creates fear of injury, prompting errors
