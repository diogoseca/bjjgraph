## ⚠️ SAFETY NOTICE

**This submission combines leg pressure with neck choke - monitor partner for BOTH rib pain and consciousness.**

- **Injury Risks**: Loss of consciousness (4-10 seconds), neck strain, rib/torso compression
- **Application Speed**: SLOW and progressive. 3-5 seconds minimum for choke aspect.
- **Tap Signals**: Verbal "tap", physical tap with hands or feet
- **Release Protocol**: Release triangle immediately, release neck pressure, return to back control, check ribs AND neck
- **Training Requirement**: Intermediate level with back control fundamentals
- **Never**: Squeeze legs and choke simultaneously at full power, ignore rib pain taps

**Remember**: Partner may tap from rib pressure before choke is complete. Respect all taps immediately. Check both neck and ribs after release.

## Overview

The Triangle from Back is an advanced variation where the attacker uses their legs to create a triangle configuration while maintaining [[Back Control]]. This hybrid submission combines elements of the traditional triangle choke with the control of back position.

The technique is particularly effective when the opponent defends the [[Rear Naked Choke]] by protecting their neck, but leaves an arm vulnerable. The legs create the choking pressure while the arms control position.

**Success Rates**: Beginner 25%, Intermediate 45%, Advanced 65%

**Unique Challenge**: Must balance leg squeezing (rib compression) with neck attack (choke) and monitor for taps from either.
