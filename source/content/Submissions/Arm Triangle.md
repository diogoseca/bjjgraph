## Transition Properties
- **Transition ID**: T501
- **Starting State**: [[Mount]] (primary), [[Side Control]], or [[Half Guard Top]]
- **Ending State**: [[Won by Submission]]
- **Success Probability**: Beginner (50%), Intermediate (70%), Advanced (85%)
- **Execution Complexity**: Medium
- **Physical Attributes**: Chest/shoulder pressure (High), Grip strength (Medium)

## Transition Description
The Arm Triangle (also known as Head and Arm Choke or Kata Gatame) is a powerful submission where the opponent's arm is trapped alongside their neck, creating a blood choke using your arm and their own shoulder. This technique leverages mechanical pressure and body positioning rather than pure strength, making it highly effective across weight classes. The arm triangle is one of the highest-percentage submissions from dominant top positions and creates a dual-threat system with positional control.

## Execution Steps
1. From a dominant position, isolate opponent's arm against their neck
2. Establish head position on the same side as the trapped arm
3. Thread your arm around opponent's head and arm, connecting your hands
4. Position your chest over opponent's shoulder to create compression
5. Maintain alignment of your shoulder pressure against opponent's carotid artery
6. Eliminate space between your chest and opponent's shoulder
7. Slide to the side opposite the trapped arm to increase pressure
8. Apply pressure by expanding chest and squeezing arms, not by arm strength
9. Maintain control until submission or tap

## Key Grips/Controls
- Head and arm isolation
- Figure-four or gable grip connection
- Chest pressure on opponent's shoulder
- Hip positioning to prevent escape
- Head placement against opponent's head
- Shoulder alignment for carotid pressure

## Common Counters
- [[Create Space Defense]] → [[Submission Escape]]
- [[Bridge and Roll]] → [[Guard Recovery]]
- [[Arm Extraction]] → [[Neutral Position]]
- [[Hand Fighting]] → [[Defensive Position]]
- [[Hip Escape]] → [[Half Guard Recovery]]

## Variants
- Traditional arm triangle (from mount or side control)
- D'arce choke (reverse arm triangle)
- Anaconda choke (reverse arm triangle from front headlock)
- Mounted arm triangle
- Side control arm triangle
- Walking arm triangle (progressive pressure variation)

## Expert Insights
- **Danaher System**: Emphasizes the alignment of shoulder pressure rather than arm squeezing as the primary finishing mechanic. Creates systematic approach to isolating the arm and head before transitioning to optimal finishing position. Focuses on controlled shifting of body weight without losing pressure during the transition to the finishing position.
- **Gordon Ryan**: Utilizes strategic weight distribution throughout the submission setup, often setting up the arm triangle as a response to defensive frames. Emphasizes maintaining shoulder connection to the opponent's jaw throughout the movement to the finishing position to prevent defensive frames.
- **Eddie Bravo**: Often incorporates the arm triangle into transition sequences from unusual positions such as the "Truck" or quarter mount. Emphasizes using the submission threat to force positional advancement even when the submission isn't completed.

## Timing Considerations
- Apply when opponent frames with inside arm
- Execute after opponent attempts to escape mount
- Time with opponent's breathing rhythm
- Implement after establishing strong chest-to-chest connection
- Use when opponent defends other submissions (creating opening)

## Follow-up Options
- If submission fails, transition to [[Mount]]
- If opponent defends by turning away, transition to [[Back Control]]
- If opponent creates space with bridge, transition to [[Technical Mount]]
- If arm slips out, switch to [[Ezekiel Choke]]
- If control is maintained but choke isn't effective, transition to [[Americana]]

## Common Errors
- Attempting to squeeze with arms only → Ineffective pressure
- Poor alignment of shoulder pressure → Insufficient compression
- Rushing the finish → Allowing defensive space
- Failing to eliminate escape routes → Losing position
- Improper sliding to finishing position → Reduced leverage

## Computer Science Analogy
The Arm Triangle represents a high-probability terminal edge in the BJJ state graph, with a strong weighted connection from dominant control positions to the submission victory state. The mechanics create a decision tree for the defender with limited viable defensive options, making it one of the highest-expected-value submission pathways from the mount and side control positions.
