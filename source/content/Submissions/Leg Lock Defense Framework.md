## Defense Description
The Leg Lock Defense Framework is a comprehensive system designed to counter modern leg lock attacks that have become prevalent in contemporary Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu, applicable in both gi and no-gi contexts. Unlike position-specific defenses, this framework addresses a category of submissions with unique mechanical principles, focusing on prevention, escape, and counter-attack against threats like heel hooks, ankle locks, and kneebars from various leg entanglement positions. It integrates positional awareness, submission mechanics, and strategic decision-making into a cohesive approach, prioritizing the protection of vulnerable joints like the knee and ankle. Essential for competition and technical completeness, this system equips practitioners with structured tools to safely navigate the complex landscape of leg lock attacks.

## Visual Execution Sequence
Detailed description for clear visualization of the defense in action:

Caught in an opponent's Ashi Garami position after a scramble, your outside leg is entangled with their legs controlling your knee line, and your heel is exposed as they attempt a heel hook, while you sit facing them with your hands ready to defend. You immediately recognize the entanglement and prioritize heel protection by internally rotating your foot to hide the heel, using your near hand to grip their wrist to prevent their heel hook grip from tightening. Simultaneously, you elevate your hips to reduce pressure on your knee, pushing off with your free leg to create space, while your far hand frames against their hip to block their advance. As initial pressure is relieved, you execute a knee line clearing motion by straightening your entangled leg and pulling it back towards your body, maintaining grip on their wrist to disrupt their control. You transition to a safer intermediary position by turning your hips away from their entanglement, using your framing hand to push off and create distance, aiming to stand up or reestablish a neutral guard. Throughout the escape, you prevent reengagement by keeping your legs aligned defensively, avoiding crossing your feet, and maintaining awareness of their potential re-attack. Finally, you establish a dominant or neutral position like combat base, ready to counter or disengage fully, ensuring your legs are positioned to minimize further entanglement risks.

**Template**: "In Ashi Garami, outside leg entangled, knee line controlled, heel exposed for heel hook, sitting facing opponent, hands ready. Protect heel by internal rotation, grip their wrist with near hand to block grip. Elevate hips, push with free leg for space, far hand frames on hip. Clear knee line by straightening and pulling leg back, maintain wrist grip. Turn hips away, push off to create distance, stand or regain guard. Prevent reengagement with defensive leg alignment, avoid crossing feet. Establish combat base or neutral position, ready to counter or disengage."

## Execution Steps
1. Recognize the specific leg entanglement position (e.g., Ashi Garami, Inside Sankaku) and immediate submission threat (e.g., heel hook, kneebar) to prioritize defensive actions.
2. Establish appropriate defensive posture by aligning your legs to protect vulnerable joints, such as internally rotating your foot to hide the heel or straightening the leg to reduce torque.
3. Secure defensive grips to control the opponent's attacking limbs, such as gripping their wrist to prevent submission grips or framing against their hip to block control.
4. Create initial space to relieve submission pressure by elevating your hips or pushing with your free leg, reducing stress on your joints while maintaining defensive alignment.
5. Implement position-specific escape mechanics, such as clearing the knee line by retracting your leg or rotating out of the entanglement, based on the specific threat.
6. Transition to a safer intermediary position or complete disengagement by turning away from the entanglement, using frames to create distance, and aiming for a neutral or dominant stance.
7. Prevent the opponent from reestablishing control during the transition by keeping legs defensively aligned, avoiding crossing feet, and maintaining whole-body awareness until fully escaped.

## Key Details
- **Entanglement Recognition**: Identifying specific leg positions and associated threats early.
- **Heel Protection**: Prioritizing the heel as the primary defensive focus against heel hooks.
- **Defensive Leg Alignment**: Maintaining leg positions that protect joints from torque and injury.
- **Hip Elevation Control**: Managing hip position to reduce pressure and create escape opportunities.
- **Knee Line Awareness**: Understanding the critical line of vulnerability at the knee for many attacks.
- **Grip Disruption**: Controlling or breaking opponent's grips to prevent submission completion.
- **Tactical Disengagement**: Choosing to disengage rather than battle prolonged entanglements.
- **Whole-Body Awareness**: Maintaining awareness beyond just legs to prevent secondary attacks.

## Success Modifiers
Factors that influence the success rate of the defense:
- **Early Recognition**: Identifying entanglement and threat before full control is established (+15%)
- **Defensive Alignment**: Proper leg and hip positioning to minimize joint vulnerability (+10%)
- **Grip Control**: Effectively disrupting opponent's attacking grips (+10%)
- **Hip Mobility**: Ability to elevate and move hips to create space for escapes (+10%)
- **Experience Level**: Familiarity with leg lock mechanics and defensive strategies (+5% per skill level)

## Common Counters and Counter-Attacks
Analysis of opponent responses with success rates for counter-attacks after defense:
- [[Re-Entanglement Attempt]] → [[Smash Pass Counter]] (Success Rate: 40%, Conditions: opponent tries to reestablish leg control post-escape)
- [[Heel Hook Grip Tightening]] → [[Heel Protection Counter]] (Success Rate: 50%, Conditions: opponent persists with heel hook grip during defense)
- [[Transition to Other Leg Lock]] → [[Leg Retraction Counter]] (Success Rate: 45%, Conditions: opponent switches to kneebar or ankle lock)
- [[Hip Control Advance]] → [[Hip Elevation Escape]] (Success Rate: 35%, Conditions: opponent advances hip control to deepen entanglement)
- [[Secondary Upper Body Attack]] → [[Guard Recovery]] (Success Rate: 30%, Conditions: opponent shifts focus to upper body submissions)
- [[Positional Domination Attempt]] → [[Back Take Counter]] (Success Rate: 25%, Conditions: opponent uses entanglement to gain dominant position)

## Decision Logic for Opponent Behavior
```
If [opponent initiates Ashi Garami] entry:
- Execute [[Defensive Leg Alignment]] then [[Hip Elevation]] (Probability: 60%)

Else if [opponent secures Inside Sankaku]:
- Prioritize [[Heel Protection]] then [[Knee Line Clearing]] (Probability: 55%)

Else if [opponent attacks straight ankle lock]:
- Apply [[Defensive Posture]] then [[Stack Escape]] (Probability: 50%)

Else if [opponent establishes 50/50 position]:
- Use [[Internal Rotation Control]] then [[Entanglement Clearing]] (Probability: 45%)

Else if [opponent targets kneebar]:
- Implement [[Knee Alignment]] then [[Leg Retraction]] (Probability: 40%)

Else if [opponent attempts toe hold]:
- Execute [[Rotational Control]] then [[Counter-Grip Establishment]] (Probability: 35%)

Else [maintain defensive awareness]:
- Adjust based on entanglement and reapply preventative measures (Probability: 30%)
```

## Variants
- Preventative Focus (emphasizing early recognition and positioning to avoid entanglements)
- Escape Focus (prioritizing specific escape mechanics for established entanglements)
- Counter-Attack Integration (incorporating immediate counter-offensive moves post-escape)
- Positional Recovery (aiming for neutral or dominant positions after defensive actions)
