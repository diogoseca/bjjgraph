## ⚠️ SAFETY NOTICE

**This submission can cause RAPID LOSS OF CONSCIOUSNESS if applied improperly.**

- **Injury Risks**: Loss of consciousness (3-7 seconds), neck strain, shoulder pressure
- **Application Speed**: SLOW and progressive. 3-5 seconds minimum. Blood choke works fast.
- **Tap Signals**: Verbal "tap", physical tap with free hand/feet
- **Release Protocol**: Release elbow pressure immediately, open guard, release head, monitor partner
- **Training Requirement**: Intermediate level with guillotine fundamentals
- **Never**: Spike or jerk the choke, maintain pressure after tap

**Remember**: High elbow position makes this choke very tight. Apply slowly despite effectiveness. Your partner trusts you.

## Overview

The High Elbow Guillotine, popularized by Marcelo Garcia, is a highly effective blood choke modification of the traditional guillotine. By raising the elbow high and creating a specific angle, the choke attacks the carotid arteries more directly than the standard guillotine's air choke.

From [[Front Headlock]] or during [[Guard Pull]] transitions, the high elbow position transforms a common submission into a razor-sharp blood choke that works quickly and reliably.

**Success Rates**: Beginner 30%, Intermediate 50%, Advanced 70%

**Key Detail**: The high elbow creates a sharper angle that targets blood flow rather than airway.
