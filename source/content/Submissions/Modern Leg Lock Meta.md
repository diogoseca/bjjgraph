## Framework Description
The Modern Leg Lock Meta provides a comprehensive analysis of contemporary leg lock strategies, systems, and counter-systems as they exist in current competitive Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu environments, applicable in both gi and no-gi contexts. This framework examines the evolution from traditional leg locks to systematic approaches that have revolutionized submission grappling over the past decade, focusing on strategic considerations, positional hierarchies, and decision-making for effective leg lock application. It integrates concepts from influential systems while offering critical analysis of competitive strengths, weaknesses, and counters, rather than teaching isolated techniques. Understanding this meta is essential for competitors at all levels, whether focusing on offensive leg lock implementation or developing defenses against specialized leg lockers.

## Visual Execution Sequence
Detailed description for clear visualization of the framework in action:

Starting from a neutral open guard position during a competitive roll, you initiate a leg lock entry by transitioning to Ashi Garami after an opponent's passing attempt, securing their near leg with your outside leg over their thigh and your inside leg hooking behind their knee, while your hands control their ankle to prevent escape. You establish inside position dominance by rotating their leg to expose their heel, maintaining connection with your hips close to theirs, using your near hand to grip their heel for a potential heel hook while your far hand frames against their hip to block counters. As they defend by internally rotating their foot, you progress up the entanglement hierarchy to Inside Sankaku, threading your outside leg under their trapped leg to lock it over your inside ankle, tightening control and further isolating their heel for attack. You apply rotational control by torquing their leg with your grip, breaking their defensive structure, and setting up the heel hook finish by securing their heel in the crook of your elbow, ensuring their knee line is controlled. If they resist or counter, you create a strategic dilemma by threatening a secondary attack like a kneebar, forcing them to defend multiple targets, then capitalize on their reaction to reapply heel hook pressure. Throughout the sequence, you maintain hip position awareness, keeping your hips aligned to maximize control and prevent escapes, adjusting tactically based on their defensive movements or ruleset constraints. Finally, you complete the submission by applying controlled pressure to the heel hook, ensuring mechanical efficiency, until the opponent taps out or the joint is compromised, demonstrating the systematic progression of the modern leg lock meta.

**Template**: "From open guard, enter Ashi Garami post-pass attempt, secure near leg with outside leg over thigh, inside leg hooks knee, hands control ankle. Gain inside position, rotate leg to expose heel, hips close, near hand grips heel, far hand frames hip. Progress to Inside Sankaku, thread outside leg under trapped leg, lock over inside ankle, isolate heel. Apply rotational control, torque leg, secure heel in elbow crook, control knee line for heel hook. Create dilemma with kneebar threat if resisted, reapply heel hook on reaction. Maintain hip alignment for control, adjust per defense or ruleset. Finish with controlled heel hook pressure until submission."

## Execution Steps
1. Initiate a leg lock entry from a common position like open guard, transitioning to a foundational entanglement such as Ashi Garami, securing the opponent's leg with proper leg and hand control.
2. Establish inside position dominance by rotating their leg to expose submission targets like the heel, maintaining close hip connection to prevent escapes while framing to block counters.
3. Progress through the entanglement hierarchy to a higher-value position like Inside Sankaku, locking your legs to isolate their limb further, enhancing control and submission opportunities.
4. Apply rotational control mechanics to break defensive structures, using grips to torque their leg and set up primary submissions like a heel hook, ensuring knee line control.
5. Create strategic dilemmas by threatening secondary attacks (e.g., kneebar, toe hold) if the primary submission is defended, forcing the opponent to expose vulnerabilities.
6. Maintain hip position awareness and connection throughout transitions, adjusting tactics based on opponent reactions or ruleset constraints to optimize control and attack efficiency.
7. Complete the submission with refined finishing mechanics, applying controlled pressure to the chosen target (e.g., heel hook) until the opponent taps or the submission is achieved, demonstrating systematic progression.

## Key Details
- **Position Before Submission**: Prioritizing control in entanglements over rushed finishes.
- **Inside Position Dominance**: Establishing superior control for optimal attack angles.
- **Entanglement Hierarchy**: Progressing from lower to higher-value control positions.
- **Rotational Control**: Managing opponent movement to prevent escapes and enable finishes.
- **Defensive Prevention**: Focusing on early disruption rather than late-stage escapes.
- **Connection Maintenance**: Preserving control during transitions between positions.
- **Strategic Dilemma Creation**: Attacking multiple targets to force defensive errors.
- **Hip Position Awareness**: Maintaining alignment for control and submission leverage.

## Success Modifiers
Factors that influence the success rate of the framework:
- **Positional Control Quality**: Securing high-value entanglements for better attack options (+15%)
- **Rotational Control Precision**: Effectively managing opponent movement to prevent escapes (+10%)
- **Entry Efficiency**: Successfully transitioning into entanglements from various positions (+10%)
- **Tactical Dilemma Execution**: Creating defensive errors through multiple threats (+10%)
- **Experience Level**: Familiarity with modern leg lock systems and counters (+5% per skill level)

## Common Counters and Counter-Attacks
Analysis of opponent responses with success rates for counter-attacks:
- [[Rotational Defense]] → [[Rotational Control Break]] (Success Rate: 45%, Conditions: opponent internally rotates to hide submission targets)
- [[Hip Elevation Defense]] → [[Hip Control Counter]] (Success Rate: 40%, Conditions: opponent elevates hips to reduce entanglement pressure)
- [[Grip Disruption Defense]] → [[Grip Reestablishment]] (Success Rate: 35%, Conditions: opponent breaks initial control grips)
- [[Counter Leg Lock Attempt]] → [[Defensive Prevention]] (Success Rate: 30%, Conditions: opponent counters with their own leg lock entry)
- [[Positional Escape]] → [[Entanglement Progression]] (Success Rate: 50%, Conditions: opponent attempts to escape to a neutral position)
- [[Upper Body Attack Shift]] → [[Combined Threat Counter]] (Success Rate: 25%, Conditions: opponent shifts focus to upper body submissions)

## Decision Logic for Opponent Behavior
```
If [opponent defends rotationally] to hide targets:
- Apply [[Rotational Control Break]] to expose submission (Probability: 50%)

Else if [opponent elevates hips] to reduce pressure:
- Implement [[Hip Control Counter]] to maintain entanglement (Probability: 45%)

Else if [opponent disrupts grips] to break control:
- Execute [[Grip Reestablishment]] for attack setup (Probability: 40%)

Else if [opponent counters with leg lock]:
- Use [[Defensive Prevention]] to neutralize threat (Probability: 35%)

Else if [opponent attempts escape] to neutral position:
- Progress to higher [[Entanglement Progression
