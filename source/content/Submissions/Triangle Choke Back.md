### Visual Execution Sequence
Detailed step-by-step description for clear movement sequence visualization:

From a dominant back control position, you secure the opponent's back with both hooks in and a seatbelt grip, controlling their torso while they defend against chokes by tucking their chin and hand-fighting. As the opponent focuses on defending their neck, you transition by pulling one of your legs out from the hook position, swinging it over their shoulder on the same side as your underhook arm, aiming to trap their head and one arm inside your leg. You then lock your legs into a triangle configuration by bringing your other leg up to hook under your knee, encircling their neck and trapped arm, while maintaining control of their torso to prevent them from turning or escaping. Using your hips and core, you squeeze your legs together to apply pressure on their carotid arteries, cutting off blood flow, while pulling their head down with your hands or adjusting your angle to maximize the choke's effectiveness. If successful, the submission results in a tap or unconsciousness for the win; if they escape, you may need to return to back control or transition to another attack to maintain dominance.

**Template**: "From back control with hooks and seatbelt grip, control opponent's torso while they defend neck. Swing one leg over shoulder to trap head and arm, lock legs in triangle by hooking under knee. Squeeze legs to apply pressure on carotid arteries, adjust angle for maximum effect, force tap or return to control if escaped."

### Execution Steps (Numbered Sequence)
1. **Setup Requirements**: Establish back control with hooks in and seatbelt grip
2. **Torso Control**: Maintain control over opponent's torso to limit movement
3. **Opponent Defense**: Opponent tucks chin and hand-fights to protect neck
4. **Leg Transition**: Pull one leg out, swing over shoulder to trap head and arm
5. **Triangle Lock**: Bring other leg up, hook under knee to form triangle around neck
6. **Grip Adjustment**: Use hands to pull head down or secure position
7. **Pressure Application**: Squeeze legs using hips and core to cut blood flow
8. **Submission Finish**: Force tap by increasing pressure or adjust if resisted

### Key Technical Details
Critical elements that determine success:
- **Back Control**: Secure hooks and seatbelt to dominate opponent's torso
- **Leg Positioning**: Swing leg over shoulder to trap head and arm effectively
- **Triangle Formation**: Lock legs by hooking under knee for tight encirclement
- **Pressure Mechanics**: Use hip and core strength to squeeze carotid arteries
- **Angle Optimization**: Adjust body position to maximize choke effectiveness

### Success Modifiers
Factors that increase/decrease probability:
- **Back Control Quality**: Strength and control of hooks and seatbelt (+/-20%)
- **Opponent Defense**: Capitalizing on poor neck protection or fatigue (+/-15%)
- **Triangle Precision**: Accurate leg positioning for tight lock (+/-15%)
- **Pressure Application**: Effective hip and core squeeze for choke (+/-10%)
- **Knowledge Test Performance**: Understanding back attack mechanics (+/-10%)

## Counter-Attack Analysis

### Common Counters
Opponent responses with success rates:
- **Head Escape**: Pulling head out before triangle locks → [[Back Control]] (Success Rate: 45%, Conditions: early recognition)
- **Arm Withdrawal**: Freeing trapped arm to break structure → [[Neutral Position]] (Success Rate: 40%, Conditions: quick reaction)
- **Hip Turn**: Turning hips to face attacker and escape → [[Guard Recovery]] (Success Rate: 35%, Conditions: strong base)
- **Counter Submission**: Attacking legs or counter choke → [[Submission Counter]] (Success Rate: 25%, Conditions: advanced skill)

Format: `[[Counter Technique]] → [[Result State]] (Success Rate: X%, Conditions: [when applicable])`

### Decision Logic
```
If [triangle setup] is recognized early:
- Execute [[Head Escape]] (Probability: 45%)

Else if [arm] can be freed quickly:
- Execute [[Arm Withdrawal]] (Probability: 40%)

Else if [base] is strong for turning:
- Attempt [[Hip Turn]] (Probability: 35%)

Else [skill level] allows for counterattack:
- Attempt [[Counter Submission]] (Probability: 25%)

Else [optimal execution]:
- Accept submission (Probability: Success Rate - Modifiers)
```

## Educational Content

### Expert Insights
Commentary as if from recognized authorities:
- **John Danaher**: "The triangle choke from the back is a devastating blood strangle that capitalizes on the opponent's defensive focus on traditional rear naked chokes. The key is in the precise leg transition to trap their head and arm, creating an inescapable structure that cuts off blood flow efficiently. This technique teaches critical principles of adaptability and control from the back position."
- **Gordon Ryan**: "In competition, the back triangle can be a surprise finisher when opponents overcommit to defending their neck from standard chokes. I use it to force submissions quickly from back control, exploiting their trapped arm for added leverage. The move demonstrates how versatile triangle mechanics can dominate even from unconventional angles."
- **Eddie Bravo**: "Triangle choke from the back shows how dynamic choke attacks can diversify your submission game from dominant positions. It integrates well with systems like back control and offers a high-percentage strangle that most opponents aren't prepared to defend. This technique is perfect for grapplers who like to chain attacks creatively."

Each insight should focus on one key technical or strategic element.

### Common Errors
For knowledge test generation:
- **Error**: Incorrect leg positioning for triangle lock
- **Why It Fails**: Reduces pressure on neck, allowing opponent to escape
- **Correction**: Ensure leg swings over shoulder and hooks under knee for tight lock
- **Recognition**: Opponent easily pulls head out or shows little discomfort

- **Error**: Insufficient back control before transition
- **Why It Fails**: Allows opponent to turn or escape during setup
- **Correction**: Maintain strong hooks and seatbelt grip before attempting choke
- **Recognition**: Opponent breaks control or initiates escape during transition

- **Error**: Over-reliance on arm strength instead of hip pressure
- **Why It Fails**: Tires you out and reduces choke effectiveness
- **Correction**: Use hip and core strength to squeeze legs for pressure
- **Recognition**: Submission attempt feels forced or lacks immediate impact

### Timing Considerations
When to attempt this submission:
- **Optimal Conditions**: When opponent focuses on defending traditional chokes
- **Avoid When**: Opponent maintains strong posture or back escape readiness
- **Setup Sequences**: After establishing secure back control with hooks in
- **Follow-up Windows**: Must lock triangle within 5-7 seconds to avoid escape

Requirements before attempting:
- **Technical Skills**: Understanding of back control and triangle mechanics
- **Physical Preparation**: Hip flexibility and core strength for leg lock
- **Positional Understanding**: Control points in back mount position
