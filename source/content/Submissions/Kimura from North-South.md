## ⚠️ SAFETY NOTICE
**Shoulder lock from dominant position. Apply slowly (3-5 seconds) and release immediately upon tap.**

## Overview
Kimura from North-South uses your weight advantage and opponent's limited mobility to execute powerful shoulder lock. Figure-four grip combined with body positioning creates high-percentage finish from this dominant control position.

## Execution Steps
1. **Isolate Arm**: From north-south, control opponent's near arm
2. **Figure-Four**: Secure figure-four grip on isolated arm
3. **Weight Distribution**: Apply chest pressure while maintaining grip
4. **Rotation**: Progressively rotate arm toward head (3-5 seconds)
5. **Release**: Stop immediately upon tap

## Safety
- **Speed**: 3-5 seconds progressive rotation
- **Signals**: Verbal and physical tap
- **Risk**: Rotator cuff injury if explosive
- **Release**: Immediate upon tap
