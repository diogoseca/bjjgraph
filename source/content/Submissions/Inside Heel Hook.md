## Transition Description
The Inside Heel Hook is a powerful leg lock submission that targets the knee by applying rotational pressure through control of the heel. This technique creates torque on the knee's ligaments, primarily the ACL and MCL, by rotating the heel while controlling the leg's positioning. The inside heel hook is considered one of the most efficient and high-percentage submissions in the modern leg lock game, but requires precise control and responsible application due to its destructive potential.

## Execution Steps
1. Establish inside leg entanglement (preferably Inside Sankaku)
2. Control opponent's trapped leg at hip level with your legs
3. Create an angle where your chest faces the opponent's toes
4. Secure grip on opponent's heel with palm facing upward
5. Place opposite hand on top of your gripping wrist or opponent's ankle
6. Pinch knees together to secure control
7. Apply finishing motion by rotating your upper body toward opponent's trapped leg while maintaining heel grip
8. Control rotation speed and be prepared to stop immediately upon submission signal

## Key Grips/Controls
- Figure-four grip on heel (palm up)
- Secondary wrist control or ankle control
- Leg triangle to trap opponent's leg
- Hip connection to prevent escape
- Knee line control (keeping knees tight)
- Upper body positioning (chest facing toes)

## Common Counters
- [[Heel Slip Defense]] → [[Leg Entanglement Neutral]]
- [[Knee Line Defense]] → [[Leg Entanglement Escape]]
- [[Hip Escape and Rotation]] → [[Neutral Position]]
- [[Knee Bar Counter]] → [[Knee Bar Control]]
- [[50/50 Entry]] → [[50/50 Guard]]

## Variants
- Traditional inside heel hook (standard grip)
- Gable grip inside heel hook
- Cross-body inside heel hook
- Reverse grip inside heel hook
- Backside inside heel hook (from backside 50/50)

## Expert Insights
- **Danaher System**: Emphasizes complete control of hip, knee line, and ankle before initiating the finishing motion. Teaches a methodical approach to breaking defensive barriers, focusing on incremental control advancement rather than explosive application. Considers the inside heel hook the premier submission of the leg lock system.
- **Gordon Ryan**: Known for exceptional control in the inside heel hook position, often utilizing subtle hip adjustments rather than pure gripping strength to generate finishing leverage. Emphasizes creating deceptive pressure that opponents often don't recognize until it's too late to defend properly.
- **Eddie Bravo**: Incorporates the inside heel hook into the 10th Planet system primarily through the "Honey Hole" (Inside Sankaku) position. Often combines leg entanglements with upper body control to create dilemmas where defending one attack exposes another.

## Timing Considerations
- Apply when opponent's defensive resources are occupied
- Execute when you have optimal angle established
- Wait for opponent to attempt escape before committing to finish
- Adjust timing based on opponent's defensive awareness
- Apply with control, especially in training scenarios

## Follow-up Options
- If heel slips, transition to [[Ankle Lock]]
- If opponent counters with leg extension, switch to [[Outside Heel Hook]]
- If control is compromised, return to [[Inside Sankaku]]
- If opponent turns away, transition to [[Back Control]]

## Safety Considerations
The inside heel hook is potentially dangerous due to:
1. Limited pain feedback before structural damage occurs
2. Rapid onset of injury when applied quickly
3. Complex ligament structures affected by the technique

Practitioners should:
- Apply with control and respect for training partners
- Release immediately upon tap
- Be aware of competition rule restrictions
- Understand proper defensive mechanics to protect themselves

## Computer Science Analogy
The Inside Heel Hook represents a high-probability terminal state transition in the BJJ state machine. Once the proper control configuration (Inside Sankaku) is achieved, the edge weight to the terminal submission state increases dramatically. The defense graph against this submission has relatively few viable escape edges, making it one of the highest expected value submissions in the entire system.
