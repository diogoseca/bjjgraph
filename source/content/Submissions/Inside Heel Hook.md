## State Machine Content Elements

### Visual Execution Sequence
Detailed step-by-step description for clear movement sequence visualization:

From the Inside Sankaku or Ashi Garami position, you start by establishing a strong inside leg entanglement, using your legs to control the opponent's trapped leg at the hip level, ensuring they cannot easily escape or rotate. Adjust your body to create an optimal angle where your chest faces the opponent's toes, allowing for maximum leverage and control over their leg. Secure a figure-four grip on their heel with your palm facing upward, while your other hand either reinforces the grip by controlling your wrist or secures their ankle to prevent slipping, and pinch your knees together to lock their leg in place. Apply the finishing motion by rotating your upper body toward the opponent's trapped leg, creating torque on their knee by turning their heel inward, while maintaining tight control through their defensive reactions, adjusting your hip pressure and grip as needed until they submit due to the intense pressure on their knee ligaments.

**Template**: "From Inside Sankaku, control opponent's leg with your legs at hip level. Angle chest to face their toes. Secure figure-four heel grip, reinforce with other hand, pinch knees to lock leg. Rotate upper body toward trapped leg for torque until submission."

### Execution Steps (Numbered Sequence)
1. **Setup Requirements**: Establish position (Inside Sankaku or Ashi Garami)
2. **Initial Movement**: Control opponent's trapped leg at hip with your legs
3. **Opponent Response**: Opponent may attempt to rotate or pull leg free
4. **Adaptation**: Adjust angle so chest faces opponent's toes for leverage
5. **Positioning**: Secure figure-four grip on heel, reinforce with other hand
6. **Pressure Application**: Pinch knees together and rotate upper body toward trapped leg
7. **Completion**: Maintain control and apply torque on knee until submission

### Key Technical Details
Critical elements that determine success:
- **Grip Requirements**: Figure-four grip on heel with palm up for control
- **Base/Foundation**: Leg entanglement to secure opponent's leg at hip
- **Timing Windows**: Execute when opponent's leg is isolated and defenses are low
- **Leverage Points**: Rotation of upper body for knee torque via heel control
- **Common Adjustments**: Adjust hip pressure and angle based on opponent's resistance

### Success Modifiers
Factors that increase/decrease probability:
- **Setup Quality**: Security of leg entanglement and hip control (+/-20%)
- **Timing Precision**: Executing before opponent rotates or escapes (+/-15%)
- **Opponent Fatigue**: Reduced defensive mobility over time (+/-5%)
- **Knowledge Test Performance**: Understanding knee torque mechanics (+/-10%)
- **Positional Control**: Effectiveness of maintaining inside angle (+/-10%)

## Counter-Attack Analysis

### Common Counters
Opponent responses with success rates:
- **Heel Slip Defense**: Slipping heel from grip to reduce torque → [[Leg Entanglement Neutral]] (Success Rate: 25%, Conditions: early reaction)
- **Knee Line Defense**: Breaking knee line control to escape → [[Leg Entanglement Escape]] (Success Rate: 20%, Conditions: strong hip movement)
- **Hip Escape and Rotation**: Rotating hips to neutralize angle → [[Neutral Position]] (Success Rate: 15%, Conditions: quick adjustment)
- **Knee Bar Counter**: Extending leg to counter with knee bar → [[Knee Bar Control]] (Success Rate: 10%, Conditions: significant leverage)
- **50/50 Entry**: Transitioning to 50/50 to equalize position → [[50/50 Guard]] (Success Rate: 10%, Conditions: quick anticipation)

Format: `[[Counter Technique]] → [[Result State]] (Success Rate: X%, Conditions: [when applicable])`

### Decision Logic for Opponent Behavior
```
If [inside heel hook setup] is not fully secured:
- Execute [[Heel Slip Defense]] (Probability: 25%)

Else if [knee line control] can be broken:
- Execute [[Knee Line Defense]] (Probability: 20%)

Else if [hip rotation] allows neutralization:
- Execute [[Hip Escape and Rotation]] (Probability: 15%)

Else if [leg extension] permits counter:
- Execute [[Knee Bar Counter]] (Probability: 10%)

Else [optimal submission execution]:
- Accept submission (Probability: Success Rate - Modifiers)
```

## Defensive Considerations

### Common Threats During Attempt
Primary risks while attempting this submission:
- **Heel Slip**: Opponent slips heel from grip → [[Leg Entanglement Neutral]] (Threat Level: Medium)
- **Position Loss**: Opponent escapes leg entanglement → [[Neutral Position]] (Threat Level: Medium)
- **Counter Attack**: Opponent counters with knee bar → [[Knee Bar Control]] (Threat Level: Low)
- **Stalemate**: Opponent rotates to neutralize angle → [[Leg Entanglement Escape]] (Threat Level: Medium)

Format: `[[Threat Type]] → [[Resulting Position]] (Threat Level: X)`

### Defensive Strategies
Methods to mitigate threats:
- **Grip Maintenance**: Secure tight figure-four grip to prevent heel slips
- **Leg Control**: Maintain strong knee pinch and hip connection to avoid escapes
- **Angle Adjustment**: Adjust chest-to-toes angle to counter hip rotation
- **Body Positioning**: Use hip pressure to limit opponent's counter options
- **Adaptation Readiness**: Be prepared to switch to other leg locks if defended

## Educational Content

### Expert Insights
Commentary as if from recognized authorities:
- **John Danaher**: "The Inside Heel Hook is the premier submission of the leg lock system. Complete control of hip, knee line, and ankle before finishing is critical. Focus on incremental control advancement rather than explosive application."
- **Gordon Ryan**: "I rely on subtle hip adjustments over pure gripping strength for the Inside Heel Hook. Creating deceptive pressure is key—opponents often don't recognize the threat until it's too late to defend."
- **Eddie Bravo**: "In the 10th Planet system, the Inside Heel Hook shines through the Honey Hole position. Combining leg entanglements with upper body control creates dilemmas where defending one attack exposes another."

Each insight should focus on one key technical or strategic element.

### Common Errors
For knowledge test generation:
- **Error**: Poor heel grip or insufficient figure-four control
- **Why It Fails**: Allows opponent to slip heel and reduce torque
- **Correction**: Ensure tight figure-four grip with palm up on heel
- **Recognition**: Heel feels loose despite leg entanglement

- **Error**: Incorrect chest-to-toes angle during setup
- **Why It Fails**: Reduces leverage for effective knee torque
- **Correction**: Adjust body so chest faces opponent's toes for optimal angle
- **Recognition**: Torque feels weak despite proper grip

- **Error**: Inadequate knee pinch or hip control
- **Why It Fails**: Allows opponent to escape leg entanglement or rotate
- **Correction**: Pinch knees tightly and maintain hip connection to lock leg

### Timing Considerations
When to attempt this submission:
- **Optimal Conditions**: When opponent's leg is isolated and defensive resources are occupied
- **Avoid When**: Opponent maintains strong hip rotation or heel defense
