## ⚠️ CRITICAL SAFETY NOTICE

**This submission can cause SHOULDER DISLOCATION and PERMANENT DAMAGE if applied improperly.**

- **Injury Risks**: Shoulder dislocation (immediate medical attention), rotator cuff tears, labrum damage
- **Application Speed**: EXTREMELY SLOW - 5+ seconds minimum. Stop at first sign of shoulder discomfort.
- **Tap Signals**: VERBAL TAP PRIMARY. Tap to discomfort, NOT pain. Pain means injury is occurring.
- **Release Protocol**: Release leg pressure immediately, let go of arm very gently, help decompress shoulder, check mobility
- **Training Requirement**: ADVANCED ONLY. Not for beginners.
- **Never**: Apply with speed, ignore shoulder discomfort, practice on inflexible partners, continue past mild pressure

**CRITICAL**: Aoki Lock attacks the shoulder at an extreme angle. Shoulders dislocate with little warning. TAP AT FIRST DISCOMFORT. Your training partner is trusting you with their shoulder function - a dislocation can end training for months.

## Overview

The Aoki Lock, named after Shinya Aoki who famously used it in competition, is an extremely dangerous shoulder lock from guard positions. The technique traps the opponent's arm and uses leg leverage to hyperrotate the shoulder joint into a compromised position.

This submission is included for completeness but is BANNED in most gi competitions and should be practiced with extreme caution or not at all in most training environments.

**Success Rates**: Beginner N/A (not recommended), Intermediate 35% (supervised only), Advanced 55%

**WARNING**: One of the most dangerous shoulder locks in BJJ. High risk of permanent injury. Practice only under expert supervision.
