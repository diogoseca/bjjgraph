## ⚠️ SAFETY NOTICE
**Shoulder lock with rotator cuff injury risk. Apply slowly over 3-5 seconds. Release immediately upon tap.**

## Overview
The Kimura from Turtle is a high-percentage shoulder lock executed when opponent is in turtle position. By isolating an arm and applying figure-four grip, you create powerful leverage on the shoulder. Turtle position limits opponent's escape options, making this one of the most successful kimura variations.

## Execution Steps
1. **Isolate Arm**: From turtle top, control opponent's near-side wrist
2. **Figure-Four Grip**: Thread arm under theirs, grip your own wrist
3. **Lift and Rotate**: Lift elbow while rotating hand toward their head
4. **Progressive Pressure**: Apply 3-5 seconds progressive rotation
5. **Release**: Stop immediately upon tap, release grip

## Safety Protocol
- **Speed**: 3-5 seconds minimum progressive rotation
- **Signals**: Verbal tap, hand tap with free arm
- **Stop**: Immediately at tap, resistance, or discomfort
- **Injury Risk**: Rotator cuff strain (2-8 weeks) if applied explosively

## Expert Insights
**Danaher**: "Turtle kimura has exceptional success rate due to opponent's limited mobility. Control elbow position for safety."
**Ryan**: "One of my highest percentage techniques. Position control allows controlled finishing in training."
**Bravo**: "Connects perfectly to back takes and rolls. Fundamental turtle top attack."

## Common Errors
- Lifting elbow too high (loses control, increases injury risk)
- Loose figure-four grip (allows escape)
- Explosive rotation (causes injury)
