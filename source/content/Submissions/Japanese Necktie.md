## ⚠️ SAFETY NOTICE

**This submission can cause LOSS OF CONSCIOUSNESS and NECK INJURY if applied improperly.**

- **Injury Risks**: Loss of consciousness (4-10 seconds), neck strain from rotation, cervical spine stress
- **Application Speed**: SLOW and progressive. 3-5 seconds minimum. This is a CHOKE, not a CRANK.
- **Tap Signals**: Verbal "tap", physical tap with free hand/feet
- **Release Protocol**: Release arm pressure immediately, loosen grip, roll off opponent's back, monitor partner
- **Training Requirement**: Intermediate level with front headlock experience
- **Never**: Crank the neck explosively or maintain pressure after tap

**Remember**: Apply compression to carotids, NOT rotation to neck. Your training partner trusts you with their safety.

## Overview

The Japanese Necktie is a blood choke from front headlock positions where the attacker threads their arm under the opponent's trapped arm to create bilateral carotid compression. The technique requires precise positioning to function as a choke rather than a dangerous neck crank.

From [[Front Headlock]], the submission becomes available when the opponent turtles and their arm can be trapped. The attacker positions perpendicular to create compression rather than rotational force.

**Success Rates**: Beginner 25%, Intermediate 45%, Advanced 65%
