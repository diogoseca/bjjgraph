## Description
The Loop Choke is a deceptively powerful collar choke that utilizes a unique "looping" motion of the arm to create a devastating strangle. This submission applies direct pressure to the carotid arteries through a deep collar grip combined with a specific wrapping motion of the forearm across the opponent's neck. Unlike many collar chokes that require dominant positioning, the Loop Choke's mechanical efficiency allows it to be executed from various positions, most notably from bottom guard and even as a counter during opponent's guard passes. The technique's distinctive feature is its ability to be applied when an opponent is driving forward, using their own forward momentum to increase the choking pressure. This makes it particularly effective as a counter-offensive submission that can rapidly render an opponent unconscious when executed with proper timing and precision.

## Execution Steps
1. Establish deep cross-collar grip with one hand, fingers inside the collar with thumb outside
2. Allow or encourage opponent to pressure forward, typically during a guard pass attempt
3. As opponent drives forward, bring gripping arm's elbow high and outside
4. Loop arm over and around opponent's head in a circular motion
5. Use free hand to secure opponent's posture or block defensive frames
6. Complete the choke by connecting elbow to hip while driving shoulder forward
7. Create compression by driving shoulder into neck while maintaining the loop configuration
8. Prevent defensive counters by controlling opponent's head position
9. Adjust angle as needed to maximize pressure on carotid arteries
10. Apply progressive pressure until submission is secured

## Key Details
- **Initial Grip**: Deep cross-collar grip with fingers inside collar, ideally knuckles against opponent's neck
- **Elbow Position**: Critical high elbow position before initiating loop motion
- **Looping Mechanics**: Circular arm motion around opponent's neck
- **Shoulder Pressure**: Drive shoulder forward to enhance choking pressure
- **Head Control**: Control opponent's head direction to prevent defensive posture
- **Timing Coordination**: Synchronize with opponent's forward movement
- **Pressure Direction**: Direct compression force across carotid arteries
- **Hip Connection**: Connect elbow to hip to complete compression circuit

## Common Counters
- [[Posture Management]] → [[Height Creation]]
- [[Hand Fighting]] → [[Grip Prevention]]
- [[Defensive Frame]] → [[Space Maintenance]]

## Variants
- Standard Loop Choke (from closed guard)
- Open Guard Loop Choke (from various open guard positions)
- Turtle Loop Choke (against a turtled opponent)
- Knee Cut Counter Loop Choke (against knee cut pass)
- Rolling Loop Choke (dynamic application with forward roll)
- No-Gi Loop Choke (modified grip for no-gi application)
- Inverted Loop Choke (specialized angle variant)
- Standing Loop Choke (rare standing application)

## Expert Insights
- **Danaher System**: While not emphasizing this submission as a primary attack within his system, acknowledges its mechanical efficiency when properly applied, particularly as a counter to aggressive guard passing. Emphasizes the precise timing and grip details that determine success or failure, focusing on the relationship between grip depth, elbow position, and the circular looping motion.
- **Gordon Ryan**: Primarily known for no-gi expertise but recognizes the Loop Choke as an effective gi-specific counter-submission. When analyzing the technique, focuses on the importance of timing and anticipation of opponent's movement, viewing it as an excellent example of using an opponent's forward pressure against them.
- **Eddie Bravo**: As a primarily no-gi focused instructor, doesn't feature the traditional Loop Choke prominently in his system. However, has developed modified variations that apply similar mechanical principles in no-gi contexts, emphasizing the importance of timing and the use of opponent's momentum to enhance submission effectiveness.

## Timing Considerations
- Execute when opponent drives forward with pressure
- Apply as opponent attempts to pass guard
- Coordinate with opponent's posture changes
- Time the looping motion with opponent's weight shift
- Accelerate application if opponent begins recognizing the threat
- Deploy when opponent's hands are occupied with passing mechanics
- Capitalize on opponent's forward momentum to enhance effect

## Setup Connections
- [[Closed Guard Bottom]] → [[Cross Collar Grip]] → [[Loop Choke]]
- [[Open Guard Bottom]] → [[Collar Control]] → [[Loop Choke]]
- [[Knee Shield Guard]] → [[Grip Establishment]] → [[Loop Choke]]
- [[Turtle Position]] → [[Head Control]] → [[Loop Choke]]
- [[Defensive Posture]] → [[Countering Pressure]] → [[Loop Choke]]
- [[Failed Sweep]] → [[Recovery Control]] → [[Loop Choke]]

## Follow-up Options
- [[Rolling Loop Transition]] (if choke is partially secured)
- [[Switch to Omoplata]] (if opponent postures defensively)
- [[Recover Guard]] (if submission fails)
- [[Sweep Opportunity]] (against defensive posture)
- [[Transition to Back]] (against specific defensive movements)

## Common Errors
- Insufficient grip depth → Ineffective compression
- Poor elbow positioning → Failed looping mechanics
- Improper timing → Missing the opportunity window
- Telegraphing intention → Defensive awareness
- Inadequate shoulder drive → Reduced choking pressure
- Focusing solely on arm strength → Premature fatigue

## Performance Tips
- Focus on establishing proper grip depth before opponent starts passing
- Develop precise timing through progressive drilling
- Practice the looping mechanics with emphasis on circular motion
- Maintain connection between elbow and hip for maximum leverage
- Create awareness of common defensive patterns
- Apply with controlled, progressive pressure rather than explosive force
- Train against various guard passing styles to develop timing sensitivity

## Training Approaches
- Isolated technical drilling with progressive resistance
- Timing-specific practice against active guard passing
- Grip fighting and grip endurance development
- Positional sparring from bottom guard
- Counter-response training against specific passes
- Rolling loop choke variations with movement integration
- Competition-specific training with ruleset considerations

## Historical Context
The Loop Choke has been a part of Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu's technical arsenal for decades, though its origins are somewhat less documented than other classical submissions. The technique gained significant prominence in the modern competition era as practitioners demonstrated its effectiveness as a counter to aggressive guard passing, particularly against the pressure-heavy passing styles that became prevalent. The choke's evolution included the development of the rolling variation, which extended its application range and created new tactical options. The Loop Choke exemplifies BJJ's emphasis on using an opponent's force against them, creating submission opportunities precisely when an opponent believes they are advancing their position.

## Conceptual Framework
The Loop Choke exemplifies the principle of "counter-offensive submission timing" in BJJ, where effectiveness comes not from imposing a predetermined attack sequence but from exploiting specific mechanical vulnerabilities created by an opponent's actions. By utilizing the opponent's forward pressure and movement, the technique creates a submission opportunity that capitalizes on the very energy intended to pass the guard. The submission demonstrates how strategic grip establishment combined with precise timing can create high-percentage finishing opportunities even from traditionally defensive positions, inverting the conventional positional hierarchy.

## Computer Science Analogy
The Loop Choke functions as an "interrupt handler" in the BJJ state machine, where it intercepts an opponent's transitional process (guard passing) and redirects execution flow to an unexpected terminal state (submission). This implements a form of "exception-based control flow" where normal positional progression is abruptly terminated when specific trigger conditions are met. The technique exemplifies a "race condition exploit" where the defender identifies a vulnerable moment in the attacker's state transition and introduces a critical operation (the loop motion) that completes faster than the original process can be aborted, creating a deterministic path to submission precisely when the opponent perceives themselves to be advancing position.
