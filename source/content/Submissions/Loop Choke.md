# Loop Choke

## ⚠️ SAFETY NOTICE
Asymmetric blood choke. Apply slowly. Release immediately upon tap.

## Overview
Single-handed collar choke from guard using opponent's own shoulder to compress one carotid artery while your forearm compresses the other. Effective when opponent postures or attempts to pass.

## Execution Steps
1. From closed guard, opponent postures up
2. Deep collar grip (hand feeds deep under their chin)
3. As they turn or move, their shoulder compresses one carotid
4. Your forearm compresses opposite carotid
5. Pull down and across for finish
6. Release immediately upon tap

## Key Details
- **Timing**: When opponent turns head or postures
- **Grip Depth**: Four fingers deep past chin
- **Pressure**: Their shoulder does half the work
- **Rolling**: Can roll to mount to finish

## Expert Insights
**John Danaher**: "Loop choke exploits opponent's natural defensive posturing to create submission."
**Gordon Ryan**: "High-percentage from guard when opponent tries to create distance."
**Eddie Bravo**: "Sneaky choke that people don't see coming until it's locked."
