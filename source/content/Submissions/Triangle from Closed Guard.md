## LLM Context: Submission Data Structure

**Purpose**: Fundamental blood choke from closed guard. Terminal state with consciousness loss risk. Safety paramount.

**Setup Checklist**:
- [ ] Closed guard (S015) with posture broken
- [ ] One arm trapped across centerline
- [ ] Hip angle adjusted 45 degrees
- [ ] Leg triangle locked (ankle behind knee)
- [ ] Partner's arm isolated
- [ ] Free arm available for tap

**Safety Q&A**:
Q: "Speed?" A: "3-5 seconds minimum in training, SLOW progressive squeeze"
Q: "Tap signals?" A: "Verbal, hand tap, foot tap - ensure partner can tap"
Q: "Danger?" A: "Loss of consciousness in 3-8 seconds if held after tap"

## ⚠️ SAFETY NOTICE

**This submission can cause LOSS OF CONSCIOUSNESS if held after tap.**

- **Injury Risks**: Loss of consciousness (3-8 seconds), neck strain, neurological issues if held excessively
- **Application Speed**: SLOW and progressive - 3-5 seconds minimum
- **Tap Signals**: Verbal "tap", physical tap with free hand/feet
- **Release Protocol**: Stop squeezing immediately, open guard, move to side, monitor partner
- **Training**: Beginner level with supervision
- **Never**: Hold after tap - unconsciousness occurs rapidly

**Remember**: Blood chokes affect brain oxygen. Respect tap immediately and monitor partner after release.

## Overview

The Triangle from Closed Guard is one of the most iconic submissions in Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu. Executed from guard by trapping opponent's head and one arm inside leg triangle while excluding the other arm, this blood choke compresses carotid arteries using opponent's own shoulder and your legs.

From [[Closed Guard Bottom]] (S015), the triangle is typically set up when opponent makes arm positioning errors - reaching across centerline or driving forward with poor posture. Technique exemplifies using guard position to create offensive threats while remaining relatively safe.

**Success Rates**:
- Beginner: 35%
- Intermediate: 55%
- Advanced: 75%

## Execution Steps

**SAFETY REMINDER**: Apply pressure slowly over 3-5 seconds. Watch for tap continuously. Monitor partner's consciousness.

1. **Arm Trap**: From closed guard, trap opponent's right arm across centerline
2. **Posture Break**: Pull head down while controlling trapped arm
3. **Leg Position**: Bring right leg high over their left shoulder
4. **Triangle Lock**: Hook left ankle behind right knee, forming triangle
5. **Angle Creation**: Shift hips 45 degrees off center, creating shoulder-to-hip line
6. **Progressive Squeeze**: Squeeze knees together and pull head down over 3-5 seconds
7. **Release**: IMMEDIATELY upon tap - stop squeeze, open guard, monitor partner

**Total Time**: 3-5 seconds from triangle lock to tap in training

## Anatomical Targeting

**Target**: Bilateral carotid arteries
**Mechanism**: Leg triangle + opponent's shoulder = compression of both carotids
**Effect**: Reduced blood flow to brain → lightheadedness → unconsciousness (3-8 seconds)

**Prevention**:
- SLOW progressive application (3-5 seconds minimum)
- Watch partner's face/color continuously
- Stop at ANY distress signs
- Release immediately upon tap
- Monitor partner for 10-15 seconds after release

## Training Progressions

**Phase 1-2** (Weeks 1-4): Technical study, zero pressure, cooperative drilling
**Phase 3-4** (Weeks 5-12): Light pressure (30-50%), supervised application
**Phase 5-6** (Week 13+): Live application with safety ingrained

## Expert Insights

### John Danaher
"The triangle choke is mechanically efficient because opponent's shoulder does most of the work. The key is the 45-degree hip angle - this makes their shoulder wedge against their neck. In training, achieve the locked position and recognize inevitability. Release upon tap immediately."

### Gordon Ryan
"In competition I finish fast (1-2 seconds). In training, I finish slow (5+ seconds). The difference is intent, not technique. Both work. Your training partners enable your practice - respect that with safety."

### Eddie Bravo
"Be creative with triangle setups, not with safety. Once locked, mechanics are the same: slow pressure, watch for tap. My students know: hurt a partner, you don't train. Period."

## Common Errors

**Technical**:
1. Insufficient angle creation (hips not 45 degrees)
2. Triangle locked too loose (space remains)
3. Wrong pulling angle on head

**SAFETY ERRORS**:
- **DANGER: Explosive Squeeze** - No time to tap, causes unconsciousness
- **DANGER: Ignoring Tap** - Unconsciousness occurs in seconds
- **DANGER: Not Monitoring Partner** - Missing consciousness loss signs

## Knowledge Assessment

1. **Primary angle?** 45 degrees from shoulder to hip - creates shoulder wedge
2. **Lock configuration?** Ankle behind knee, legs squeezed tight, no space
3. **Application speed in training?** 3-5 seconds minimum progressive squeeze
4. **Tap signals?** Verbal, hand tap on leg, foot tap on mat - ensure partner can tap
5. **Release protocol?** Stop squeeze instantly, open guard, move to side, monitor partner 10-15 seconds
