## State Machine Content Elements

### Visual Execution Sequence
Detailed step-by-step description for clear movement sequence visualization:

From a dominant side control position, you control the opponent's upper body with a strong crossface and underhook, keeping their near arm isolated. As the opponent attempts to turn into you or shrimp to escape, you capitalize on their movement by stepping over their head with your near leg, placing your knee near their ear while maintaining chest pressure to prevent their escape. You then pull their isolated arm across their body to create space and angle, allowing you to swing your far leg over their neck, trapping their head and arm in a triangle configuration. Adjusting your hips, you lock your legs by pulling your ankle behind your knee, forming the triangle shape, and squeeze while pulling their head down to cut off blood flow to the carotid arteries. If necessary, you adjust your angle by shifting your hips or underhooking their far leg to prevent them from posturing up, tightening the choke until they submit.

**Template**: "From side control, isolate their near arm with a crossface and underhook. Step over their head with your near leg as they turn or shrimp, then swing your far leg over their neck to trap their head and arm in a triangle. Lock your legs by pulling your ankle behind your knee, adjust your hips, and squeeze while pulling their head down to finish the choke."

### Execution Steps (Numbered Sequence)
1. **Setup Requirements**: Establish strong side control with crossface and underhook
2. **Initial Control**: Isolate opponent's near arm to limit defensive options
3. **Opponent Response**: Opponent turns into you or shrimps to escape
4. **Position Transition**: Step over their head with near leg, knee near their ear
5. **Triangle Setup**: Swing far leg over neck, trapping head and isolated arm
6. **Lock and Finish**: Lock legs in triangle, adjust hips, squeeze and pull head down

### Key Technical Details
Critical elements that determine success:
- **Arm Isolation**: Controlling opponent's near arm to prevent defense
- **Leg Positioning**: Precise placement of legs to form triangle around neck
- **Hip Adjustment**: Shifting hips to optimal angle for maximum pressure
- **Squeeze Mechanics**: Leg contraction combined with head pull for choke
- **Control Maintenance**: Preventing opponent from posturing or escaping during setup

### Success Modifiers
Factors that increase/decrease probability:
- **Setup Control**: Quality of initial side control and arm isolation (+/-15%)
- **Timing Precision**: Capitalizing on opponent's escape attempt (+/-20%)
- **Opponent Fatigue**: Reduced ability to defend or posture up (+/-10%)
- **Knowledge Test Performance**: Understanding triangle mechanics (+/-10%)
- **Angle Optimization**: Proper hip positioning for choke tightness (+/-15%)

## Counter-Attack Analysis

### Common Counters
Opponent responses with success rates:
- **Posture Defense**: Posturing up to prevent leg lock → [[Side Control]] (Success Rate: 50%, Conditions: early recognition)
- **Arm Defense**: Using isolated arm to block leg swing → [[Side Control]] (Success Rate: 45%, Conditions: arm not fully controlled)
- **Hip Escape**: Shrimping to create space before triangle locks → [[Guard Recovery]] (Success Rate: 40%, Conditions: quick reaction)
- **Stack Counter**: Stacking to relieve pressure if partially locked → [[Side Control]] (Success Rate: 30%, Conditions: strong base)

Format: `[[Counter Technique]] → [[Result State]] (Success Rate: X%, Conditions: [when applicable])`

### Decision Logic
```
If [triangle setup] is recognized early:
- Execute [[Posture Defense]] (Probability: 50%)

Else if [arm isolation] is incomplete:
- Execute [[Arm Defense]] (Probability: 45%)

Else if [space creation] is possible:
- Execute [[Hip Escape]] (Probability: 40%)

Else [partial lock] with base:
- Attempt [[Stack Counter]] (Probability: 30%)

Else [optimal execution]:
- Accept submission (Probability: Success Rate - Modifiers)
```

## Educational Content

### Expert Insights
Commentary as if from recognized authorities:
- **John Danaher**: "The side triangle choke is a powerful submission that exploits an opponent's defensive movements from side control. The key lies in understanding the geometry of the triangle - your legs must form a precise shape around their neck and arm to maximize pressure on the carotid arteries. This technique teaches critical principles of control and adaptation that apply to all top game submissions."
- **Gordon Ryan**: "In competition, the side triangle is highly effective because it catches opponents off-guard during their escape attempts. I use it to finish matches quickly when I sense their arm is isolated and their posture is vulnerable. The submission demonstrates how top position control can seamlessly transition into devastating attacks."
- **Eddie Bravo**: "The side triangle integrates well with a dynamic top game and can be adapted from various control positions. It often surprises opponents who are focused on escaping side control, creating opportunities for other attacks if they defend the choke. This technique shows how traditional submissions can be applied from unconventional angles."

Each insight should focus on one key technical or strategic element.

### Common Errors
For knowledge test generation:
- **Error**: Failing to isolate opponent's arm properly
- **Why It Fails**: Allows opponent to defend or block the triangle setup
- **Correction**: Ensure strong control of near arm with underhook before stepping over
- **Recognition**: Opponent easily blocks leg swing with their arm

- **Error**: Incorrect leg positioning or locking
- **Why It Fails**: Reduces pressure on neck, making choke ineffective
- **Correction**: Lock ankle behind knee and adjust hips for tight triangle shape
- **Recognition**: Choke feels loose or opponent breathes normally

- **Error**: Poor hip angle or lack of adjustment
- **Why It Fails**: Allows opponent to posture up or escape pressure
- **Correction**: Shift hips to side or underhook far leg to maintain angle
- **Recognition**: Opponent starts to posture or create space

### Timing Considerations
When to attempt this submission:
- **Optimal Conditions**: When opponent turns into you or attempts escape
- **Avoid When**: Opponent maintains strong defensive posture in side control
- **Setup Sequences**: After establishing dominant side control with arm control
- **Follow-up Windows**: Must lock within 3-5 seconds to prevent counter
