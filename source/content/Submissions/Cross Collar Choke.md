## State Description
The Cross Collar Choke is a fundamental gi-based submission where the practitioner uses their grips on the opponent's lapels to create a powerful strangle by applying pressure to both sides of the neck. This classic submission involves placing one hand deep inside the opponent's collar and the other hand across to grip the opposite lapel, creating a cross-formation that compresses the carotid arteries when properly applied. While most commonly executed from the closed guard, mount, or side control positions, variations of the cross collar choke exist from numerous positions throughout BJJ. This submission represents one of the most fundamental techniques in traditional Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu and has remained effective at all levels of competition despite the evolution of the sport.

## Key Principles
- Establish deep grip placement with first hand
- Create proper cross-formation with second hand
- Apply pressure by expanding elbows rather than pulling with arms
- Utilize rotational movement to increase pressure
- Maintain proper posture and body positioning relative to opponent
- Prevent defensive hand fighting through grip management
- Apply synchronized pressure to both sides of the neck

## Prerequisites
- Understanding of proper grip placement
- Recognition of entry opportunities
- Knowledge of choking mechanics
- Ability to maintain position while applying submission

## State Invariants
- One hand deep in opponent's collar
- Second hand gripping opposite lapel in cross formation
- Wrists rotated to create pressure
- Elbows expanded outward
- Connection between practitioner and opponent's upper body

## Defensive Responses (When Opponent Has This State)
- [[Hand Fighting]] → [[Grip Breaking]]
- [[Posture Up]] → [[Defensive Posture]]
- [[Create Space]] → [[Frame Creation]]
- [[Chin Tuck]] → [[Trachea Protection]]
- [[Bridge and Roll]] → [[Guard Pass]] (from guard)

## Offensive Transitions (Available From This State)
- [[Cross Collar Finish]] → [[Won by Submission]]
- [[Baseball Bat Choke Transition]] → [[Baseball Bat Choke]]
- [[Ezekiel Combination]] → [[Ezekiel Choke]]
- [[Switch to Armbar]] → [[Armbar Control]]
- [[Switch to Triangle]] → [[Triangle Control]]

- [[Mount Transition]] → [[Mount]] (from guard)

## Counter Transitions

## Expert Insights
- **Danaher System**: Emphasizes precise mechanical details in the execution of the cross collar choke, focusing on the exact grip depth, wrist rotation, and elbow position that maximize choking efficiency. Places particular emphasis on understanding the anatomical principles that make the choke effective and how to apply pressure to the carotid arteries rather than the trachea.
- **Gordon Ryan**: While primarily a no-gi specialist, acknowledges the cross collar choke's effectiveness in the gi and its role within an integrated submission system. When teaching the technique, emphasizes the connection between the cross collar choke and other submissions that can be transitioned to if the initial attack is defended.
- **Eddie Bravo**: Has adapted principles from the traditional cross collar choke into his no-gi system through variations like the "Zombie Choke," focusing on creating similar pressure mechanics without gi grips. Recognizes the cross collar choke as a foundational technique in traditional BJJ that demonstrates core choking principles.

## Common Errors
- Insufficient grip depth → Reduced choking effectiveness
- Pulling with arms rather than expanding elbows → Energy inefficiency
- Poor wrist rotation → Inadequate pressure application
- Improper body positioning → Reduced leverage
- Telegraphing submission intent → Defensive awareness

## Training Drills
- Grip placement and depth practice
- Isolated pressure application without resistance
- Transition flows between cross collar and related submissions
- Defensive recognition and counter drills
- Position maintenance while applying submission

## Related States
- [[Closed Guard Bottom]] - Common position for applying the choke
- [[Mount]] - Dominant position for the submission
- [[Ezekiel Choke]] - Related collar choke
- [[Loop Choke]] - Related collar submission
- [[Baseball Bat Choke]] - Variation of collar strangulation

## Decision Tree
If opponent attempts to posture:
- Execute [[Cross Collar Finish]] or [[Switch to Triangle]]

Else if opponent tucks chin defensively:
- Execute [[Baseball Bat Choke Transition]] or [[Ezekiel Combination]]

Else if opponent defends with hand fighting:
- Execute [[Switch to Armbar]] or [[Loop Choke Variation]]

Else if opponent attempts to pass (from guard):
- Execute [[Mount Transition]] or [[Cross Collar to Back Take]]

## Position Metrics
- Success Rate: 70% submission when fully established (competition data)
- Average Time in Position: 5-20 seconds
- Submission Probability: 65%
- Counter Vulnerability: 25%
- Position Loss Probability: 20%

## Optimal Paths
Standard finish path:
[[Cross Collar Choke]] → [[Cross Collar Finish]] → [[Won by Submission]]

Guard to mount path:
[[Cross Collar Choke]] → [[Mount Transition]] → [[Mount]] → submission sequence

Submission chain path:
[[Cross Collar Choke]] → [[Switch to Triangle]] → [[Triangle Control]] → [[Triangle Finish]] → [[Won by Submission]]

## Historical Context
The Cross Collar Choke represents one of the oldest and most fundamental techniques in Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu, having been a cornerstone of the Gracie family's system since its development. The technique demonstrates the core principle of BJJ - using leverage and proper positioning to defeat larger, stronger opponents - as it requires minimal strength when properly executed. The choke has been featured in countless competitive matches and street self-defense scenarios throughout BJJ's history, reinforcing its status as a timeless and reliable submission method.

## Gi vs No-Gi Considerations
The Cross Collar Choke is primarily a gi-specific technique, relying on lapel grips for execution. In no-gi contexts, similar mechanical principles can be applied through techniques like the no-gi ezekiel or various arm triangle variations, but the classic cross collar grip configuration is not available. This represents one of the clearest distinctions between gi and no-gi BJJ, highlighting how clothing can be weaponized in traditional BJJ.

## Computer Science Analogy
The Cross Collar Choke implements a "resource constraint attack" in the BJJ state machine, where the vital resources (blood flow through carotid arteries) are systematically restricted through a well-positioned mechanical structure. This creates a form of "deadlock" where the defender's escape options diminish as blood flow restriction increases, eventually leading to a terminal state. The technique exemplifies an "optimization algorithm" that maximizes pressure output while minimizing energy expenditure through proper biomechanical alignment.
