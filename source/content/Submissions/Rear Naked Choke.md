## Transition Description
The Rear Naked Choke (RNC), also known as "Mata Leão" (Lion Killer) in Portuguese or Hadaka Jime in Judo, is one of the most effective and high-percentage submissions in BJJ. This blood choke is applied from the back position by encircling the opponent's neck with one arm, using the bicep and forearm to compress the carotid arteries on both sides of the neck, restricting blood flow to the brain and causing unconsciousness if not defended or tapped to.

## Execution Steps
1. From back control, establish seatbelt control (one arm over shoulder, one under)
2. Insert choking arm deep around neck, with elbow under opponent's chin
3. Place forearm against one side of opponent's neck and bicep against the other
4. Grasp the shoulder of your choking arm with your free hand
5. Position choking hand behind opponent's head or against the back of their shoulder
6. Pull elbows toward each other to apply pressure to both carotid arteries
7. Apply controlled pressure until submission or tap

## Key Grips/Controls
- Deep insertion of choking arm around neck
- Hand-to-bicep grip or hand-to-shoulder grip
- Supporting hand control behind opponent's head
- Body lock or body triangle to prevent defensive movement
- Head control to prevent chin tucking

## Common Counters
- [[Chin Tucking Defense]] → [[RNC Survival Position]]
- [[Hand Fighting]] → [[Back Control Neutral]]
- [[Two-on-One Grip]] → [[Back Control Neutral]]
- [[Rolling Escape]] → [[Guard Recovery]]
- [[Forward Roll Escape]] → [[Turtle Position]]

## Variants
- Traditional RNC (palm-to-bicep grip)
- Short choke (palm-to-shoulder grip)
- No-hooks RNC (applied while standing or without leg hooks)
- One-arm RNC (rare, extremely advanced variation)
- Neck crank variation (primarily pain-based rather than blood choke)

## Expert Insights
- **Danaher System**: Emphasizes the straitjacket control system to eliminate defensive hand fighting before attempting the choke. Focuses on the mechanical precision of the choking arm position, stressing that the elbow of the choking arm should be directly below the opponent's chin and that pressure comes from elbows drawing together rather than from squeezing with the arms.
- **Gordon Ryan**: Known for a patient approach to the RNC setup, systematically breaking down defensive structures through hand trapping and precise pressure application. Often uses a modified grip where the hand of the choking arm grips the opposite shoulder rather than the traditional bicep grip.
- **Eddie Bravo**: Incorporates unique setups from the "Twister Side Control" and "Truck" positions that lead to unorthodox RNC variations. Emphasizes attacking when opponents defend other submissions rather than forcing the RNC as a primary attack.

## Timing Considerations
- Apply when opponent's defensive hand fighting is compromised
- Time with opponent's inhalation for maximum effect
- Execute immediately after opponent defends another attack
- Capitalize on moment when opponent attempts to escape back control
- Transition rapidly if opponent's chin becomes exposed during movement

## Follow-up Options
- If choke fails due to chin tucking, transition to [[Face Crank]]
- If opponent defends successfully, switch to [[Armbar from Back]]
- If control is compromised, transition to [[Bow and Arrow Choke]]
- If opponent escapes partially, move to [[Technical Back Mount]]

## Computer Science Analogy
The RNC represents an optimal terminal node in the BJJ state machine graph - it has a high success probability once reached and few viable escape edges. The path from back control to RNC represents one of the highest expected value transitions in the entire BJJ system.
