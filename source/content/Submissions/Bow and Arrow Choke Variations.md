# Bow and Arrow Choke Variations

## ⚠️ SAFETY NOTICE
Blood choke causing rapid unconsciousness. Apply slowly. Release immediately upon tap.

## Overview
Variations of the bow and arrow choke from back control or turtle, using collar and pants/belt grips with leg extension to create powerful choking pressure.

## Execution Steps
1. Establish back control or turtle top
2. Collar grip (one side deep)
3. Pants or belt grip (opposite side)
4. Roll to side, extend top leg
5. Pull collar while pushing with leg
6. Monitor and release upon tap

## Variations
- **Traditional**: Collar + pants grip
- **Belt Variation**: Collar + belt grip
- **Modified Angle**: Different rolling direction
- **Standing Entry**: From standing back control

## Expert Insights
**John Danaher**: "Bow and arrow uses leg extension as mechanical multiplier for collar pressure."
**Gordon Ryan**: "One of highest percentage finishes from back when opponent turtles defensively."
**Eddie Bravo**: "Powerful choke combining upper and lower body mechanics simultaneously."
