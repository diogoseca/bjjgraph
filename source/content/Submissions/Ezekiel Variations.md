## Visual Execution Sequence

From mount position, you slide one arm under opponent's neck with your forearm across their throat while gripping your own gi sleeve. Your other hand controls their head or pushes down on your choking forearm. As you drive your weight forward and compress with your forearm, the gi sleeve provides friction and control while your opposite hand creates additional pressure. The combined forces compress the carotid arteries and potentially the trachea, creating a powerful choking effect that forces submission.

### Execution Steps
1. **Setup**: Establish mount or guard position with upper body control
2. **Arm Insertion**: Slide choking arm under opponent's neck
3. **Grip Establishment**: Grab own gi sleeve for control
4. **Pressure Application**: Drive forearm across throat while controlling head
5. **Completion**: Progressive pressure until tap

### Success Modifiers
- **Arm Position**: Deep forearm placement (+/-20%)
- **Sleeve Control**: Secure gi sleeve grip (+/-15%)
- **Weight Distribution**: Forward pressure maintenance (+/-10%)
- **Position Control**: Stable mount or guard (+/-10%)

## Variations

### From Mount (Traditional)
- Beginner 45%, Intermediate 65%, Advanced 80%
- Slide arm under neck from high mount
- Grip own sleeve for control
- Drive weight forward for pressure
- Most common variation

### From Closed Guard Bottom
- Intermediate 50%, Advanced 70%
- Break opponent's posture
- Insert arm under neck from bottom
- Grip sleeve and compress while opening guard
- Surprising attack from defensive position

### From Side Control
- Advanced 55%, Advanced 75%
- Control opponent while inserting arm
- Transition to modified mount position
- Apply pressure while maintaining control
- Technical setup required

### No-Gi Variation
- Intermediate 45%, Advanced 65%
- Use forearm instead of gi sleeve
- Grip own wrist or bicep for control
- Effective in both gi and no-gi
- Requires more precise positioning

## Expert Insights
- **John Danaher**: "The Ezekiel choke's effectiveness comes from using your own sleeve as a tool for leverage and friction. The key is sliding the forearm deep under the neck before applying pressure. This creates a situation where your limb structure, not muscular strength, generates the choking force."
- **Gordon Ryan**: "In no-gi, I adapt the Ezekiel concept using wrist-to-bicep grips. The mechanics remain similar but require tighter positioning. From mount, it's particularly effective when opponents defend other attacks, as they often overlook this threat until too late."
- **Eddie Bravo**: "The Ezekiel demonstrates how gi control creates submission opportunities that seem impossible in no-gi. However, the underlying principle of forearm pressure across the throat applies universally. I teach the no-gi variation as part of mount attack sequences."

## Common Errors
- **Insufficient arm depth**: Forearm too high on neck
- **Poor weight distribution**: Not driving forward
- **Weak sleeve grip**: Easy to defend
- **Incorrect angle**: Forearm parallel instead of diagonal

### SAFETY ERRORS
- **Explosive application**: Sudden pressure causing injury
- **Ignoring tap**: Continuing after submission
- **Excessive trachea pressure**: Targeting windpipe instead of carotids

## Training Progressions
- **Weeks 1-3**: Positioning and arm insertion (no pressure)
- **Weeks 4-8**: Controlled application at 40% pressure
- **Weeks 9-12**: Building to 70% with partner feedback
- **Months 4+**: Live integration with safety protocols

## Related Submissions

- **Baseball Bat Choke** - Alternative gi choke
- **Guillotine** - No-gi equivalent concept

## Competition Applications
- **IBJJF Rules**: Legal at all belt levels (gi and no-gi)
- **Strategic Use**: Surprise attack from dominant positions
- **Versatility**: Works in both gi and no-gi formats
