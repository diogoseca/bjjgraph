## Chain Description
The Rear Naked Choke (RNC) Pathway represents the most statistically dominant submission chain in Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu, built around what many consider the most high-percentage submission in the art. This system begins with the fundamental back control position—widely regarded as the most dominant positional control in grappling—and presents a systematic approach to breaking down defensive barriers to achieve various choking mechanics. Unlike many submission chains that require complex positional adjustments, the RNC system focuses primarily on systematic hand fighting and incremental control improvements to neutralize defensive structures, creating a highly reliable finishing system that functions effectively across body types, skill levels, and competitive contexts. The core of this system is the traditional Rear Naked Choke, a blood choke applied from the back by encircling the opponent's neck with one arm and using the bicep and forearm to compress the carotid arteries, though the complete pathway includes essential variations and alternatives that address specific defensive scenarios.

## ⚠️ Safety Considerations

### Injury Risks
Rear Naked Choke and related blood chokes can cause serious injuries if applied incorrectly:
- **Loss of Consciousness** (Severity: High, Recovery: Immediate to hours) - Blood chokes can render partner unconscious in 5-10 seconds if held after tap
- **Carotid Artery Damage** (Severity: Critical, Recovery: Weeks to permanent) - Excessive pressure or improper technique can damage carotid arteries
- **Trachea Damage** (Severity: High, Recovery: 2-8 weeks) - Improper forearm position can crush the windpipe instead of targeting carotids
- **Neck Strain** (Severity: Medium, Recovery: 1-3 weeks) - Cranking or twisting during choke can strain cervical muscles

### Application Speed
- Apply submissions SLOWLY and progressively over 3-5 seconds minimum
- Never apply sudden or "spiking" choke pressure
- Maintain constant awareness of partner's tap signals and consciousness
- Watch for color changes in partner's face indicating blood flow restriction

### Tap Signals
Partners must establish clear tap signals before training:
- **Verbal Tap**: Saying "tap" or "stop" loudly and clearly
- **Physical Tap**: Tapping partner's arm, body, mat, or own leg (minimum 2 taps)
- **Emergency Signal**: Multiple rapid taps or any sign of distress if unable to tap normally

### Release Protocol
When partner taps:
1. Immediately release all choking pressure from the neck
2. Remove choking arm from around their neck completely
3. Release hooks and allow partner to breathe freely
4. Monitor partner for 10-15 seconds to ensure full consciousness and recovery

### Training Progression
- **Weeks 1-2**: Back control maintenance only, no submission attempts
- **Weeks 3-4**: Slow-motion choke positioning (10% speed), partner taps at 20% pressure
- **Weeks 5-8**: Medium speed with light resistance (50% speed), partner taps at 50% pressure
- **Ongoing**: Full speed only with experienced partners who understand choke mechanics

### Partner Communication
- Establish tap awareness before drilling any choke techniques
- Discuss any neck or throat sensitivity issues before training
- Verbal check-ins during drilling: "You good?" to monitor partner status
- Watch for signs of consciousness loss: color change, body going limp, eyes closing

## Visual Execution Sequence
Detailed description for clear visualization of the primary submission in the chain:

From a dominant back control position, your chest is glued to your opponent's back, legs hooked securely around their hips with both hooks in, one over their shoulder and the other under their armpit in a seatbelt grip, establishing unyielding control. You initiate the Rear Naked Choke by sliding your choking arm—typically the one under their armpit—across their neck, ensuring your forearm aligns with their trachea, while your other hand maintains control over their shoulder to prevent escapes. You secure the choke by bringing your choking arm's hand to the crook of your other elbow, forming a tight loop around their neck, with your non-choking hand pushing their head down to eliminate space and enhance pressure. You adjust your hips slightly to maintain spinal alignment, keeping your chest-to-back connection tight, preventing them from turning or creating defensive space, as your legs squeeze their torso to limit movement. You apply incremental pressure by pulling your elbows together rather than squeezing with brute force, focusing on compressing the carotid arteries on both sides of their neck, cutting off blood flow to the brain. Throughout the sequence, you anticipate defensive reactions like hand fighting or chin tucking, ready to strip grips or transition to alternative chokes like the Bow and Arrow if needed, maintaining control with subtle weight shifts. Finally, you complete the submission by maintaining controlled pressure until the opponent taps out or loses consciousness, demonstrating the mechanical efficiency and strategic depth of the RNC pathway in achieving a high-percentage finish.

**Template**: "From back control, chest to back, hooks around hips, seatbelt grip with one arm over shoulder, one under armpit. Slide choking arm across neck, forearm on trachea, other hand controls shoulder. Secure choke, choking hand to other elbow crook, non-choking hand pushes head down. Adjust hips for spinal alignment, maintain chest connection, legs squeeze torso. Apply pressure by pulling elbows together, compress carotid arteries. Anticipate defenses like hand fighting, ready to strip grips or switch chokes. Complete submission with controlled pressure until tap or unconsciousness."

## Execution Steps
1. Establish a dominant back control position, securing both hooks around the opponent's hips, chest glued to their back, and a seatbelt grip with one arm over their shoulder and the other under their armpit.
2. Initiate the Rear Naked Choke by sliding the choking arm (typically the under-armpit arm) across their neck, aligning the forearm with their trachea, while the other hand maintains shoulder control.
3. Secure the choke by bringing the choking arm's hand to the crook of the other elbow, forming a tight loop around their neck, and use the non-choking hand to push their head down, eliminating defensive space.
4. Adjust hip position to maintain spinal alignment and chest-to-back connection, squeezing legs around their torso to limit movement and prevent turning or escapes.
5. Apply incremental pressure by pulling elbows together, focusing on compressing the carotid arteries rather than using brute force, ensuring effective blood flow restriction.
6. Anticipate and counter defensive reactions such as hand fighting or chin tucking by systematically stripping grips or transitioning to alternative chokes like Bow and Arrow or Short Choke if blocked.
7. Complete the submission with controlled pressure, maintaining the choke until the opponent taps out or loses consciousness, leveraging the high-percentage mechanics of the RNC pathway.

## Key Details
- **Chest-to-Back Connection**: Maintaining persistent spinal alignment to prevent defensive escapes.
- **Control Before Submission**: Establishing dominant position and neutralizing defenses before choke application.
- **Hand Fighting Dominance**: Systematically winning control over defensive frames and grips.
- **Incremental Pressure**: Building submission pressure progressively rather than explosively for safety and effectiveness.
- **Defensive Anticipation**: Recognizing and exploiting predictable defensive patterns like chin tucking or rolling.
- **Choking Mechanics**: Understanding precise arterial compression for blood chokes over air chokes.
- **Positional Adjustment**: Making subtle body positioning changes to enhance leverage and control.
- **Space Elimination**: Systematically removing defensive space to increase choking effectiveness.

## Success Modifiers
Factors that influence the success rate of the primary submission in the chain:
- **Back Control Quality**: Strength of initial positional dominance with hooks and seatbelt grip (+15%)
- **Hand Fighting Effectiveness**: Ability to strip defensive grips and maintain control (+10%)
- **Choke Positioning Precision**: Accurate alignment of forearm and elbow for carotid compression (+10%)
- **Defensive Counter Management**: Anticipating and neutralizing reactions like chin tucking or rolling (+10%)
- **Experience Level**: Familiarity with back attack systems and choke variations (+5% per skill level)

## Common Counters and Counter-Attacks
Analysis of opponent responses with success rates for counter-attacks within the chain:
- [[Hand Fighting Defense]] → [[Grip Stripping Counter]] (Success Rate: 50%, Conditions: opponent uses two-on-one grip to protect neck)
- [[Chin Tuck Defense]] → [[Face Cover Variation]] (Success Rate: 45%, Conditions: opponent tucks chin to block choke entry)
- [[Forward Roll Defense]] → [[Back Control Reestablishment]] (Success Rate: 40%, Conditions: opponent rolls forward to escape)
- [[Defensive Framing]] → [[Bow and Arrow Transition]] (Success Rate: 35%, Conditions: opponent creates frames to block RNC)
- [[Hip Movement Defense]] → [[Hook Adjustment Counter]] (Success Rate: 30%, Conditions: opponent bridges or moves hips to create space)
- [[Turn Into Attacker]] → [[Armbar Transition]] (Success Rate: 25%, Conditions: opponent turns to face attacker exposing arm)

## Decision Logic for Opponent Behavior
```
If [opponent hand fights] with two-on-one grip:
- Execute [[Grip Stripping Counter]] to reestablish control (Probability: 60%)

Else if [opponent tucks chin] to block entry:
- Apply [[Face Cover Variation]] or transition to neck crank (Probability: 55%)

Else if [opponent rolls forward] to escape:
- Follow with [[Back Control Reestablishment]] maintaining hooks (Probability: 50%)

Else if [opponent creates frames] to defend:
- Transition to [[Bow and Arrow Choke]] (Probability: 45%)

Else [maintain back control]:
- Adjust positioning and reapply RNC pressure (Probability: 40%)
```

## Common Errors

### 1. Poor Back Control Before Choke Attempt
**Problem**: Attempting rear naked choke without fully securing back control (both hooks in, seatbelt grip established).

**Why it happens**: Rushing to the submission before the controlling position is dominant.

**Correction**: Establish both hooks securely around opponent's hips. Secure seatbelt grip (one arm over shoulder, one under armpit). Only then pursue choking mechanics.

**Result if uncorrected**: Opponent escapes back control during choke attempt, wasting the positional advantage entirely. Back control is lost chasing premature submission.

### 2. Weak Choking Arm Positioning (Bicep Not on Carotid)
**Problem**: Positioning forearm across throat/windpipe instead of ensuring bicep and forearm compress carotid arteries on both sides.

**Why it happens**: Misunderstanding RNC as an air choke rather than a blood choke, or poor positional awareness.

**Correction**: Blade of forearm should be across opponent's trachea with bicep on one side of neck. When you complete the lock, bicep and opposite forearm compress both carotid arteries.

**Result if uncorrected**: Ineffective choke that opponent can endure (air choke) or extended choking time, increasing danger. Proper blood choke should work in 5-10 seconds.

### 3. Not Controlling Opponent's Hands (Hand Fighting Failure)
**Problem**: Allowing opponent to establish two-on-one grip on your choking arm, preventing choke advancement.

**Why it happens**: Focusing entirely on arm positioning while neglecting opponent's defensive hand positioning.

**Correction**: Systematically strip opponent's defensive grips. Use your non-choking hand to break their two-on-one grip, creating opportunities to advance choking position.

**Result if uncorrected**: Stalemate position where choke cannot progress. Opponent maintains enough defense to prevent finish, eventually finding escape or time running out.

### 4. Poor Chest-to-Back Connection
**Problem**: Separating chest from opponent's back, creating space that allows them to turn or escape.

**Why it happens**: Overemphasis on arm technique without understanding that spinal control is foundational.

**Correction**: Maintain persistent chest-to-back connection throughout entire sequence. Your chest should be "glued" to their back, making turning impossible.

**Result if uncorrected**: Opponent turns toward you (escaping back control), or creates enough space to defend hands, strip hooks, or escape entirely.

### 5. Squeezing with Arms Instead of Pulling Elbows
**Problem**: Attempting to finish choke by squeezing with arm strength rather than using elbow pull mechanics.

**Why it happens**: Misunderstanding the mechanical efficiency of the technique.

**Correction**: Rather than "squeeze harder," focus on pulling elbows TOGETHER. This creates perpendicular pressure on carotid arteries with minimal effort.

**Result if uncorrected**: Exhaustion from inefficient squeezing, insufficient pressure to complete choke, or reliance on strength rather than technique.

### 6. Neglecting Leg/Hook Control During Choke
**Problem**: Allowing hooks to slip or losing leg control while focused on upper body choking mechanics.

**Why it happens**: Tunnel vision on choke completion while lower body control degrades.

**Correction**: Maintain active hook control throughout choking sequence. Squeeze legs around opponent's torso to limit their movement even as you finish choke.

**Result if uncorrected**: Opponent uses lower body movement to escape - rolling, turning, or posting to create space - despite having choke partially locked.

### 7. Not Transitioning to Alternate Chokes
**Problem**: Persisting with RNC when opponent successfully defends it, rather than switching to Bow and Arrow, Short Choke, or Collar Choke.

**Why it happens**: Fixation on RNC as the only option from back control, missing the system's adaptability.

**Correction**: If opponent successfully tucks chin or defends RNC, immediately recognize and transition to appropriate alternative based on their defense (Bow and Arrow if they turn, Short Choke if chin is tucked).

**Result if uncorrected**: Wasted energy fighting opponent's best defense instead of using their defensive position to set up alternatives.

### 8. ⚠️ DANGER: Applying Sudden "Spike" Pressure
**Problem**: Squeezing the choke explosively in a sudden "spike" motion rather than progressive pressure.

**Why it happens**: Frustration with slow progress or attempting to finish before opponent can tap.

**Correction**: Apply ALL choking pressure progressively over 3-5 seconds minimum. Partner should feel pressure building gradually, not suddenly applied.

**Result if uncorrected**: Potential TRACHEA DAMAGE if choke position is incorrect (windpipe instead of carotids). Neck strain injuries. Also creates dangerous situation where partner cannot tap in time.

### 9. ⚠️ DANGER: Holding Choke After Tap
**Problem**: Continuing to squeeze after partner has tapped, not releasing immediately.

**Why it happens**: Tunnel vision on completion, delayed reaction time, or not feeling tap on back/shoulder.

**Correction**: Maintain awareness of tap signals throughout. Agree on verbal tap as backup since arms may be trapped. Release ALL pressure within 0.5 seconds of tap.

**Result if uncorrected**: LOSS OF CONSCIOUSNESS (RNC causes unconsciousness in 5-10 seconds), potential brain damage if held excessively. Complete breach of training trust and safety.

### 10. ⚠️ DANGER: Not Monitoring Partner's Consciousness
**Problem**: Not watching for signs of consciousness loss (color change, body going limp, eyes closing) during choke application.

**Why it happens**: Focus on technique execution rather than partner safety monitoring.

**Correction**: Continuously monitor partner's condition during choke. Watch for color changes in face/neck, body tension changes, or loss of resistance. If partner goes limp without tapping, RELEASE IMMEDIATELY.

**Result if uncorrected**: Partner goes unconscious without tapping (possible if choke is very tight or partner is stubborn). Held unconsciousness can cause brain damage. Serious safety violation.
