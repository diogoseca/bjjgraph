## Visual Execution Sequence

From closed guard, you establish a deep cross collar grip with your first hand, inserting four fingers inside the collar with thumb outside. Your second hand mirrors this on the opposite collar, creating a scissoring configuration. As you pull your elbows apart and down toward your chest, the collars cross over opponent's neck, compressing both carotid arteries simultaneously. The pressure increases as you bring your elbows closer to your body while pulling the collars in opposite directions, creating irresistible choking force.

### Execution Steps
1. **Setup**: Establish closed guard or top position with collar access
2. **First Grip**: Deep cross collar grip with four fingers in, thumb out
3. **Second Grip**: Mirror grip on opposite collar
4. **Application**: Pull elbows down and apart to create scissoring pressure
5. **Completion**: Progressive pressure until tap

### Success Modifiers
- **Grip Depth**: Deep collar penetration (+/-20%)
- **Timing Precision**: Optimal defensive windows (+/-15%)
- **Opponent Fatigue**: Reduced defense (+/-5%)
- **Position Control**: Maintained pressure (+/-15%)

## Variations

### From Closed Guard (Classic)
- Beginner 50%, Intermediate 70%, Advanced 90%
- Both hands crossed on collar
- Pull elbows to chest while opening guard
- Highest percentage variation

### From Mount
- Beginner 40%, Intermediate 60%, Advanced 80%
- Control opponent's hips while establishing grips
- Use body weight to prevent escape
- Can combine with grapevine control

### From Side Control
- Intermediate 55%, Advanced 75%
- Establish grips while controlling opponent
- Transition to modified mount for finish
- More technical setup required

### Single-Wing Variation
- Intermediate 50%, Advanced 70%
- One cross collar grip, one standard grip
- Less powerful but faster setup
- Effective when second cross collar is defended

## Expert Insights
- **John Danaher**: "Cross collar chokes represent the most fundamental and highest percentage gi submissions. Proper grip depth and elbow positioning create mechanical advantage that overcomes strength differences. The key is establishing deep grips before opponent recognizes threat."
- **Gordon Ryan**: "I use cross collar attacks from every position in gi competition. The setup can be disguised within other attacks, making it highly effective. Patience in grip establishment prevents defensive reactions and increases finish rates significantly."
- **Eddie Bravo**: "While primarily a gi technique, the principles of cross-body pressure apply to no-gi variations. In gi competition, cross collar attacks from unconventional positions create surprise opportunities that complement my overall system."

## Common Errors
- **Shallow grips**: Reduces leverage and allows easy defense
- **Parallel elbows**: Decreases choking pressure significantly
- **Poor posture control**: Allows opponent to create space and escape
- **Rushed setup**: Telegraphs attack and triggers defensive reactions

### SAFETY ERRORS
- **Explosive application**: No time for tap, potential injury
- **Ignoring tap**: Continuation after submission signal
- **Excessive force**: Unnecessary pressure beyond tap point

## Training Progressions
- **Weeks 1-2**: Grip mechanics and positioning (no pressure)
- **Weeks 3-6**: Controlled application at 30-50% pressure
- **Weeks 7-12**: Progressive resistance building to 70% pressure
- **Months 4+**: Live rolling integration with safety maintained
