## Submission Description
The Arm Triangle Progression is a systematic sequence of techniques designed to secure an arm triangle choke, also known as Kata Gatame, by isolating the opponent's arm and head while applying pressure to cut off blood flow to the brain. This progression is typically initiated from dominant positions like side control or mount, focusing on trapping one of the opponent's arms across their neck to create the choking mechanism. It is a high-percentage submission in both gi and no-gi contexts due to its reliance on leverage and body positioning rather than brute strength. The progression involves a series of steps to ensure control, making it adaptable to various defensive reactions and a staple in competitive BJJ and MMA.

## Visual Execution Sequence
Detailed description for clear visualization of the submission in action:

Starting from side control, you maintain a tight crossface with your shoulder driving into the opponent's jaw, controlling their head while your other arm underhooks their far arm, pinning it to the mat to establish dominance. You isolate their near arm by guiding it across their body towards their neck, using your chest and shoulder to trap it in place, ensuring their arm is positioned to contribute to the choke. As you secure this arm position, you transition your body by stepping over their head with your near leg, moving into a north-south position or a modified mount, keeping their arm trapped tightly against their carotid artery. Your far arm then reaches around their neck, connecting with your near arm to form a tight grip, often clasping hands or using a gable grip, while your head drops low to the mat on the opposite side to maximize pressure. With the structure in place, you squeeze your elbows together, driving your shoulder into their trapped arm to compress their neck, cutting off blood flow while maintaining heavy hip pressure to prevent escapes. Finally, you adjust your angle if necessary, shifting your weight to the side of the trapped arm to intensify the choke, holding the position until the opponent taps out or the submission is complete.

**Template**: "From side control, use a tight crossface to control opponent's head, underhook far arm for dominance. Isolate near arm across their body to neck, trap with chest and shoulder. Step over head with near leg to north-south or modified mount, keep arm trapped against carotid. Reach far arm around neck, connect with near arm in tight grip, head low on opposite side. Squeeze elbows together, drive shoulder into trapped arm to compress neck, maintain hip pressure. Adjust angle to trapped arm side for intensified choke, hold until submission."

## Execution Steps
1. Establish control from side control or mount with a strong crossface and underhook on the far arm to limit opponent's movement.
2. Isolate the opponent's near arm by guiding it across their body towards their neck, using your torso to pin it in place.
3. Transition your position by stepping over their head with your near leg, moving to north-south or a modified mount to secure the arm against their neck.
4. Wrap your far arm around their neck, connecting it with your near arm using a clasp or gable grip to form the choking structure.
5. Apply pressure by squeezing your elbows together, driving your shoulder into the trapped arm to compress their neck while keeping your head low on the opposite side.
6. Maintain heavy hip pressure and adjust your body angle to the side of the trapped arm to maximize choke effectiveness, preventing escapes.
7. Hold the position with consistent pressure, monitoring for the opponent's tap or signs of submission completion, ready to release if necessary.

## Key Details
- **Arm Isolation**: Trapping the opponent's arm across their neck is critical for the choke mechanism.
- **Head Control**: Crossface or head pressure prevents opponent from turning or escaping.
- **Grip Configuration**: Clasp or gable grip ensures a secure hold around the neck and arm.
- **Body Positioning**: Transition to north-south or modified mount for optimal leverage.
- **Pressure Application**: Shoulder drive into trapped arm combined with elbow squeeze for blood flow restriction.
- **Hip Pressure**: Heavy hips prevent opponent from rolling or creating space.
- **Angle Adjustment**: Shifting to the trapped arm side increases choke intensity.
- **Defensive Awareness**: Monitor for opponent's attempts to roll, bridge, or pull arm out.

## Success Modifiers
Factors that influence the success rate of the submission:
- **Arm Isolation Precision**: Properly trapping the arm across the neck (+15%)
- **Positional Control**: Maintaining dominant position during transition (+10%)
- **Grip Strength**: Secure connection of arms for choke structure (+10%)
- **Pressure Application**: Effective shoulder drive and elbow squeeze (+10%)
- **Experience Level**: Familiarity with choke mechanics and adjustments (+5% per skill level)

## Common Counters and Counter-Attacks
Analysis of opponent responses with success rates for counter-attacks:
- [[Arm Pull Escape]] → [[Arm Freed]] (Success Rate: 50%, Conditions: opponent pulls trapped arm out before choke is locked)
- [[Roll to Guard]] → [[Guard Recovery]] (Success Rate: 40%, Conditions: opponent rolls to recover guard during transition)
- [[Bridge Defense]] → [[Space Creation]] (Success Rate: 35%, Conditions
