## State Properties
- **State ID**: S024
- **Point Value**: 1 (Neutral with slight advantage)
- **Position Type**: Transitional control position
- **Risk Level**: Medium
- **Energy Cost**: Medium to High
- **Time Sustainability**: Short to Medium

## State Description
The Dogfight Position (also known as the "Coyote" position) is a dynamic transitional state that typically arises from half guard when the bottom player secures an underhook and comes up to their knees. Both practitioners are facing the same direction in a kneeling position, with one player controlling their opponent's upper body through an underhook while the opponent attempts to counter with a whizzer (overhook). This position creates a critical junction point with multiple offensive pathways available to both practitioners, making it one of the most dynamic and contested positions in the half guard system.

## Key Principles
- Establish and maintain a strong underhook for the primary attacker
- Control opponent's near-side arm and hip
- Maintain base and balance through proper knee positioning
- Create pressure against opponent's overhook/whizzer
- Drive into opponent to compromise their base
- Anticipate and counter defensive switches
- Manage momentum and energy to set up attacks

## Prerequisites
- Understanding of underhook mechanics
- Solid base and balance
- Hip mobility and dexterity
- Ability to maintain control during dynamic exchanges

## State Invariants
- Both practitioners in kneeling position
- Primary attacker has underhook control
- Defender typically has overhook/whizzer counter
- Practitioners facing same direction
- Connection at upper body and hip

## Defensive Responses (When Opponent Has This State)
- [[Strong Whizzer]] → [[Whizzer Control]]
- [[Switch Base Direction]] → [[Dogfight Counter]]
- [[Back Step]] → [[Reverse Half Guard]]
- [[Sprawl and Pressure]] → [[Front Headlock]]
- [[Limp Arm Escape]] → [[Standing Position]]

## Offensive Transitions (Available From This State)
- [[Dogfight Back Take]] → [[Back Control]]
- [[Roll Under Sweep]] → [[Top Position]]
- [[Knee Tap Takedown]] → [[Side Control]]
- [[Dogfight to Single Leg]] → [[Single Leg Control]]
- [[Transition to X-Guard]] → [[X-Guard]]
- [[Modified Duck Under]] → [[Back Control]]
- [[Switch to Single X]] → [[Single Leg X Guard]]
- [[Dogfight to Mount]] → [[Mount]]

## Counter Transitions
- [[Re-establish Dogfight]] → [[Dogfight Position]] (against counters)
- [[Retreat to Half Guard]] → [[Half Guard Bottom]] (if position is compromised)
- [[Switch to Deep Half]] → [[Deep Half Guard]] (under pressure)

## Expert Insights
- **Danaher System**: Emphasizes the dogfight as a critical decision point within the half guard system, focusing on maintaining proper hip connection and head position to prevent defensive counters. Creates systematic approach to either back takes or sweeps based on the opponent's defensive reactions, particularly their whizzer pressure and hip positioning.
- **Gordon Ryan**: Utilizes dogfight frequently as part of his half guard system, emphasizing the importance of controlling the opponent's posting arm and creating off-balancing leverage. Often uses the position to set up highly efficient back takes through subtle weight distribution manipulations.
- **Eddie Bravo**: Incorporates the dogfight position within the 10th Planet system with unique control mechanisms focusing on head position and the "coyote" position. Often connects it directly to the truck position and twister side control rather than traditional back takes.

## Common Errors
- Poor underhook depth → Reduced control effectiveness
- Overcommitting to forward drive → Vulnerability to counters
- Weak base positioning → Balance compromise
- Head positioned too low → Defensive vulnerability
- Neglecting whizzer pressure → Loss of positional control

## Training Drills
- Dogfight entry from half guard with progressive resistance
- Transition flows between dogfight and related positions
- Base and balance maintenance exercises
- Counter-response drills to whizzer pressure
- Back take and sweep combinations with resistance

## Related States
- [[Half Guard Bottom]] - Common entry position to dogfight
- [[Butterfly Half Guard]] - Related half guard variant
- [[Back Control]] - Common destination from dogfight
- [[Single Leg X Guard]] - Potential transition option
- [[Deep Half Guard]] - Alternative position from half guard

## Decision Tree
If opponent applies heavy whizzer pressure:
- Execute [[Roll Under Sweep]] or [[Switch to Deep Half]]

Else if opponent's base is compromised forward:
- Execute [[Dogfight Back Take]] or [[Modified Duck Under]]

Else if opponent stands to create space:
- Execute [[Dogfight to Single Leg]] or [[Transition to X-Guard]]

Else if opponent tries to switch base:
- Execute [[Knee Tap Takedown]] or [[Roll Under Sweep]]

## Position Metrics
- Success Rate: 65% offensive advancement (competition data)
- Average Time in Position: 10-30 seconds
- Back Take Probability: 45%
- Sweep Probability: 40%
- Position Loss Probability: 25%

## Optimal Paths
Primary back-taking path:
[[Dogfight Position]] → [[Dogfight Back Take]] → [[Back Control]] → [[Rear Naked Choke]] → [[Won by Submission]]

Sweeping path:
[[Dogfight Position]] → [[Roll Under Sweep]] → [[Top Position]] → [[Side Control]] → dominant position sequence

Modern transition path:
[[Dogfight Position]] → [[Switch to Single X]] → [[Single Leg X Guard]] → leg entanglement sequence

## Computer Science Analogy
The Dogfight Position represents a critical decision node in the BJJ state graph with high branching factor and bidirectional state transitions. It functions as an "unstable equilibrium" in dynamic systems theory, where small inputs can lead to drastically different outputs. The position creates a complex game theory scenario where both practitioners must simultaneously optimize their control parameters while anticipating the opponent's adaptive responses, similar to a minimax algorithm in adversarial search problems.
