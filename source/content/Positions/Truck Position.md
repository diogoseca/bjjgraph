# Truck Position
#bjj #state #control #10thplanet #submission

## State Properties
- **State ID**: S039
- **Point Value**: 2 (Advantageous control position)
- **Position Type**: Specialized control/submission position
- **Risk Level**: Low to Medium
- **Energy Cost**: Medium
- **Time Sustainability**: Medium

## State Description
The Truck Position (also known as "The Twister Position") is a specialized control position developed and popularized by Eddie Bravo within his 10th Planet Jiu-Jitsu system. In this position, the controlling practitioner is positioned perpendicular to their opponent, with one leg threaded underneath the opponent's leg and the other leg hooked over top, creating a figure-four leg entanglement that controls the opponent's lower body while maintaining upper body control through various grips. This position offers exceptional control with multiple high-percentage submission options including the Twister, Banana Split, Calf Slicer, and back takes, making it one of the most versatile specialized control positions in modern BJJ.

## Visual Description

You are positioned on your side, your body perpendicular to your opponent who lies on their side or partially inverted, with your legs forming a figure-four lock around one of their legs. Your bottom leg threads under their leg while your top leg hooks over it, your feet locking together to create a tight leg entanglement that immobilizes their lower body. Your opponent's trapped leg is bent and controlled, preventing them from using it to create base or mobility, while their free leg struggles to find purchase on the mat. Your hands control their upper body through grips on their far arm, shoulder, or head, or you may establish an underhook or use a gi grip to prevent them from turning away or establishing defensive frames. The opponent is twisted uncomfortably, their hips and shoulders facing different directions due to your perpendicular alignment and leg control, creating significant strain on their back and hip. Your chest presses against their hip or lower back, applying pressure that pins them in place while you maintain the figure-four leg lock. This asymmetric configuration severely limits their mobility and creates openings for multiple submission attacks, as they struggle against the conflicting pressures on their upper and lower body, unable to generate the coordinated movement needed to escape.

## Key Principles
- Establish figure-four leg entanglement around opponent's leg
- Maintain perpendicular body alignment relative to opponent
- Control opponent's upper body through effective grips
- Create and maintain proper pressure against opponent's hip
- Prevent opponent from establishing defensive frames
- Manage transitions to maximize offensive options
- Apply systematic pressure to isolate limbs for submissions

## Prerequisites
- Understanding of twister/truck mechanics
- Hip mobility and leg dexterity
- Recognition of entry opportunities
- Knowledge of connected submission systems

## State Invariants
- Figure-four leg entanglement around opponent's leg
- Perpendicular body positioning
- Upper body control through grips or hooks
- Opponent typically on side or partially inverted
- Control of opponent's hip mobility

## Defensive Responses (When Opponent Has This State)
- [[Hip Escape]] → [[Guard Recovery]]
- [[Leg Extension]] → [[Neutral Position]]
- [[Turn Away]] → [[Turtle Position]]
- [[Forward Roll]] → [[Scramble Position]]
- [[Grip Fighting]] → [[Hand Control Escape]]

## Offensive Transitions (Available From This State)
- [[Twister Setup]] → [[Twister Control]]
- [[Calf Slicer]] → [[Won by Submission]]
- [[Banana Split]] → [[Won by Submission]]
- [[Truck to Back]] → [[Back Control]]
- [[Lockdown from Truck]] → [[Electric Chair]]
- [[Honeyhole Transition]] → [[Inside Sankaku]]
- [[Truck Sweep]] → [[Top Position]]
- [[Modified Kneebar]] → [[Kneebar Control]]

## Counter Transitions
- [[Re-establish Truck]] → [[Truck Position]] (against escape attempts)
- [[Switch to Crab Ride]] → [[Crab Ride]] (if position is compromised)
- [[Transition to Half Guard]] → [[Half Guard Top]] (under pressure)

## Expert Insights
- **Danaher System**: While not a core position in the Danaher system, recognizes the Truck's value as a specialized control position with high submission potential, particularly as it connects to leg entanglements. Emphasizes the mechanical principles that make the position effective, focusing on how to systematically break down defensive barriers when in the position.
- **Gordon Ryan**: Acknowledges the Truck as a powerful position within specialized submission systems but utilizes it selectively within his overall game. When employing the position, emphasizes maintaining solid control mechanics before pursuing submissions, particularly focusing on preventing defensive escapes.
- **Eddie Bravo**: As the primary developer and proponent of the Truck position, has created an extensive subsystem of entries, controls, and submission options from this position. Emphasizes the position's versatility as both a control mechanism and a launching pad for multiple submission attacks, viewing it as a central hub in his 10th Planet system.

## Common Errors
- Insufficient leg entanglement → Loss of lower body control
- Poor upper body control → Defensive mobility
- Rushing submission attempts → Position compromise
- Neglecting grip control → Escape opportunities
- Improper body alignment → Reduced leverage

## Training Drills
- Truck position maintenance against progressive resistance
- Transition flows between Truck and related positions
- Entry practice from various positions
- Submission sequences with proper control maintenance
- Defensive recognition and counter drills

## Decision Tree
If opponent actively defends upper body:
- Execute [[Calf Slicer]] or [[Banana Split]]

Else if opponent attempts to turn away:
- Execute [[Truck to Back]] or [[Twister Setup]]

Else if opponent tries to free leg:
- Execute [[Lockdown from Truck]] or [[Honeyhole Transition]]

Else if opponent attempts to roll:
- Execute [[Truck Sweep]] or [[Modified Kneebar]]

## Position Metrics
- Success Rate: 75% offensive advancement (competition data)
- Average Time in Position: 15-45 seconds
- Submission Probability: 65%
- Back Take Probability: 50%
- Position Loss Probability: 15%

## Optimal Paths
Twister submission path:
[[Truck Position]] → [[Twister Setup]] → [[Twister Control]] → [[Won by Submission]]

Back-taking path:
[[Truck Position]] → [[Truck to Back]] → [[Back Control]] → [[Rear Naked Choke]] → [[Won by Submission]]

Lower body submission path:
[[Truck Position]] → [[Calf Slicer]] → [[Won by Submission]]

## Historical Context
The Truck Position was developed and popularized by Eddie Bravo as part of his 10th Planet Jiu-Jitsu system in the early 2000s. While initially viewed as an unorthodox or niche position, it has gained wider acceptance as high-level practitioners have demonstrated its effectiveness in competition. The position represents an innovation in how control can be established through asymmetrical body positioning and specialized entanglements, and has been particularly influential in expanding the range of submission options available from non-traditional control positions.

## Computer Science Analogy
The Truck Position represents a specialized "state lock" in the BJJ state graph that immobilizes critical degrees of freedom while maintaining flexible transition options for the controlling player. This creates an asymmetric decision space where the controlling player maintains multiple high-probability edges to advantageous states while the defender's available transitions are severely constrained. The position exemplifies the concept of a "greedy algorithm" in competitive grappling, where local optimization (establishing the truck) leads to globally optimal outcomes (high-percentage submission opportunities).
