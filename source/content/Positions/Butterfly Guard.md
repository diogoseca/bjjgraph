# Butterfly Guard
#bjj #state #guard #open_guard #butterfly

## State Properties
- **State ID**: S011
- **Point Value**: 0 (Neutral with offensive advantage)
- **Position Type**: Offensive guard position
- **Risk Level**: Medium
- **Energy Cost**: Medium to High
- **Time Sustainability**: Medium

## State Description
Butterfly Guard is a dynamic open guard variation where the bottom player inserts hooks (feet) under the opponent's thighs while sitting up, creating powerful leverage for sweeps and upper body control. This position allows for explosive elevation of the opponent and offers exceptional offensive options while maintaining defensive capabilities. Butterfly Guard serves as both a powerful position in its own right and as a connector between various guard configurations.

### Visual Description
You are seated on the mat in an upright position, facing your opponent who is typically on their knees or in a combat base stance, attempting to pass your guard. Your feet are inserted as hooks under their thighs, with your knees flared outward to create inside control and leverage for elevation or sweeps. Your upper body is engaged, often with grips on their collar, sleeves, or underhooks to control their posture and prevent them from standing tall or applying pressure. This setup allows you to dynamically shift your hips and legs to off-balance the opponent, creating opportunities for powerful attacks while maintaining a strong defensive barrier against guard passes.

## Key Principles
- Create and maintain inside position with feet (hooks)
- Control opponent's posture through upper body grips
- Establish proper seated posture with strong base
- Generate elevation through leg drive and upper body pull
- Time attacks with opponent's weight shifts
- Maintain defensive awareness for pass attempts

## Prerequisites
- Hip mobility and core strength
- Understanding of leverage and fulcrum principles
- Ability to control distance with feet and hands
- Basic gripping strategies

## State Invariants
- Hooks (feet) inserted under opponent's thighs
- Seated upright position (not flat on back)
- Upper body control through grips
- Opponent facing you (not passing around)

## Defensive Responses (When Opponent Has This State)
- [[Pressure Pass Attempt]] → [[Headquarters Position]] (Success Rate: 40%)
- [[Hook Removal Strategy]] → [[standing up]] (Success Rate: 35%)
- [[Knee Slice Entry]] → [[Knee Slice Pass]] (Success Rate: 30%)
- [[Upper Body Control]] → [[Smash Pass]] (Success Rate: 25%)

## Offensive Transitions (Available From This State)

- [[Shin-to-Shin Transition]] → [[Shin-to-Shin Guard]] (Success Rate: Beginner 25%, Intermediate 40%, Advanced 55%)

## Counter Transitions
- [[Re-Guard to Butterfly]] → [[Butterfly Guard]] (against pass attempts)
- [[Hook Reinsertion]] → [[Butterfly Guard]] (against hook removal)
- [[Transition to Half Guard]] → [[Half Guard Bottom]] (under pressure)

## Expert Insights
- **Danaher System**: Emphasizes the importance of consistent upward elevator pressure with hooks while controlling the upper body to prevent the opponent from establishing their base. Creates a systematic process of destabilizing the opponent's base before executing sweeps, with a strong focus on preventing defensive posturing.
- **Gordon Ryan**: Utilizes butterfly guard primarily as a staging position for entries to more complex guards like Single Leg X. When using butterfly for sweeping, emphasizes creating "false retreats" where apparent defensive movements bait opponents into forward pressure that sets up sweeps.
- **Eddie Bravo**: Often combines butterfly hooks with rubber guard principles to create hybrid positions. Emphasizes unorthodox gripping strategies and quick transitions to leg entanglements, particularly the "lockdown" half guard when butterfly is pressured.

## Common Errors
- **Error**: Flat back positioning
  - **Consequence**: Leads to reduced leverage and vulnerability to pressure, making it easier for the opponent to flatten you and pass your guard.
  - **Correction**: Maintain an upright seated posture with your core engaged to maximize leverage and defensive capability.
- **Error**: Inactive hooks
  - **Consequence**: Results in ineffective elevation mechanics, limiting your ability to off-balance or sweep the opponent.
  - **Correction**: Keep your hooks active by driving your feet under the opponent's thighs to create constant upward pressure.
- **Error**: Poor grip sequencing
  - **Consequence**: Causes inability to control opponent's posture, allowing them to stand tall or apply passing pressure.
  - **Correction**: Establish strong upper body grips like collar or underhooks before initiating attacks to break their posture.
- **Error**: Overcommitment to single attacks
  - **Consequence**: Leads to predictability, making it easier for the opponent to anticipate and counter your moves.
  - **Correction**: Chain multiple attacks together, using feints or misdirection to keep the opponent guessing.
- **Error**: Failure to maintain posture
  - **Consequence**: Increases vulnerability to smash passing as the opponent can collapse your structure and control your upper body.
  - **Correction**: Focus on keeping your elbows in and shoulders forward to maintain a strong defensive posture against pressure.

## Training Drills
- **Hook Insertion and Elevation**: Practice hook insertion and elevation with progressive resistance, focusing on driving feet under the opponent's thighs.
- **Transition Cycles**: Drill transition cycles between butterfly and related guards like X-Guard or Single Leg X to improve fluidity.
- **Upper Body Control Sequences**: Work on upper body control sequences with grip fighting to maintain posture control.
- **Defensive Recovery**: Focus on defensive recovery to butterfly from pressure, ensuring you can re-establish hooks after being flattened.
- **Sweep Combinations**: Practice sweep combinations from butterfly, chaining multiple attacks to increase offensive options.

Leg entanglement path:
[[Butterfly Guard]] → [[Single Leg X Entry]] → [[Single Leg X Guard]] → [[Inside Sankaku]] → [[Inside Heel Hook]] → [[Won by Submission]]

## Timing Considerations
- **Optimal Conditions**: Most effective when opponent's posture is broken or they are driving forward, allowing for powerful sweeps or transitions to other guards.
- **Avoid When**: Less effective if opponent maintains a strong upright posture and controls your upper body, increasing the risk of guard passes.
- **Energy/Fatigue Factors**: Medium to high energy cost means it requires active engagement, and prolonged use can lead to fatigue in the legs and core.

## Historical Context
Butterfly Guard emerged as a significant position in Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu during the late 20th century, gaining prominence through practitioners like Marcelo Garcia, who showcased its sweeping potential in high-level competition. It represents a shift towards dynamic, offensive guard play, contrasting with more static closed guard systems. Modern BJJ has further evolved Butterfly Guard into a hub for complex guard transitions, integrating it with systems like X-Guard and Single Leg X, reflecting the sport's ongoing technical development.

## Ruleset Considerations
The Butterfly Guard's utility varies across competition rulesets:
- **IBJJF**: Highly effective for sweeps and points, often used to initiate attacks or transition to other guards for strategic advantage.
- **ADCC**: Valuable for both sweeping and setting up leg entanglements, particularly in no-gi where grip options are limited.
- **Professional Submission-Only Formats**: Frequently used as a platform for chaining attacks, with transitions to submissions like guillotines or leg locks being common.
- **MMA**: Useful for off-balancing and sweeping to regain top position, though less common due to striking risks while on the bottom.

## Computer Science Analogy
Butterfly Guard functions as a hub node with high connectivity in the BJJ state graph. It has edges connecting to many other positions, with different weights (probabilities) based on the opponent's reaction. It serves as an efficient router for transitioning between different attack systems, making it a versatile position in the overall graph structure.
