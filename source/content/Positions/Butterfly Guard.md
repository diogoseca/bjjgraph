## State Properties
- **State ID**: S011
- **Point Value**: 0 (Neutral with offensive advantage)
- **Position Type**: Offensive guard position
- **Risk Level**: Medium
- **Energy Cost**: Medium to High
- **Time Sustainability**: Medium

## State Description
Butterfly Guard is a dynamic open guard variation where the bottom player inserts hooks (feet) under the opponent's thighs while sitting up, creating powerful leverage for sweeps and upper body control. This position allows for explosive elevation of the opponent and offers exceptional offensive options while maintaining defensive capabilities. Butterfly Guard serves as both a powerful position in its own right and as a connector between various guard configurations.

## Key Principles
- Create and maintain inside position with feet (hooks)
- Control opponent's posture through upper body grips
- Establish proper seated posture with strong base
- Generate elevation through leg drive and upper body pull
- Time attacks with opponent's weight shifts
- Maintain defensive awareness for pass attempts

## Prerequisites
- Hip mobility and core strength
- Understanding of leverage and fulcrum principles
- Ability to control distance with feet and hands
- Basic gripping strategies

## State Invariants
- Hooks (feet) inserted under opponent's thighs
- Seated upright position (not flat on back)
- Upper body control through grips
- Opponent facing you (not passing around)

## Defensive Responses (When Opponent Has This State)
- [[Pressure Pass Attempt]] → [[Headquarters Position]]
- [[Hook Removal Strategy]] → [[Standing Pass]]
- [[Knee Slice Entry]] → [[Knee Slice Pass]]
- [[Upper Body Control]] → [[Smash Pass]]

## Offensive Transitions (Available From This State)
- [[Basic Butterfly Sweep]] → [[Top Position]]
- [[Arm Drag from Butterfly]] → [[Back Control]]
- [[Single Leg X Entry]] → [[Single Leg X Guard]]
- [[Guillotine Setup]] → [[Guillotine Control]]
- [[Elevator Sweep]] → [[Mount]] or [[Side Control Top]]
- [[X-Guard Transition]] → [[X-Guard]]
- [[Shin-to-Shin Transition]] → [[Shin-to-Shin Guard]]

## Counter Transitions
- [[Re-Guard to Butterfly]] → [[Butterfly Guard]] (against pass attempts)
- [[Hook Reinsertion]] → [[Butterfly Guard]] (against hook removal)
- [[Transition to Half Guard]] → [[Half Guard Bottom]] (under pressure)

## Expert Insights
- **Danaher System**: Emphasizes the importance of consistent upward elevator pressure with hooks while controlling the upper body to prevent the opponent from establishing their base. Creates a systematic process of destabilizing the opponent's base before executing sweeps, with a strong focus on preventing defensive posturing.
- **Gordon Ryan**: Utilizes butterfly guard primarily as a staging position for entries to more complex guards like Single Leg X. When using butterfly for sweeping, emphasizes creating "false retreats" where apparent defensive movements bait opponents into forward pressure that sets up sweeps.
- **Eddie Bravo**: Often combines butterfly hooks with rubber guard principles to create hybrid positions. Emphasizes unorthodox gripping strategies and quick transitions to leg entanglements, particularly the "lockdown" half guard when butterfly is pressured.

## Common Errors
- Flat back positioning → Reduced leverage and vulnerability to pressure
- Inactive hooks → Ineffective elevation mechanics
- Poor grip sequencing → Inability to control opponent's posture
- Overcommitment to single attacks → Predictability
- Failure to maintain posture → Vulnerability to smash passing

## Training Drills
- Hook insertion and elevation with progressive resistance
- Transition cycles between butterfly and related guards
- Upper body control sequences with grip fighting
- Defensive recovery to butterfly from pressure
- Sweep combinations from butterfly

## Related States
- [[X-Guard]] - Advanced guard with similar mechanics
- [[Single Leg X Guard]] - Related leg entanglement
- [[Shin-to-Shin Guard]] - Hybrid butterfly variation
- [[Seated Guard]] - Similar upright position without hooks
- [[Half Butterfly]] - Hybrid with one butterfly hook and half guard

## Decision Tree
If opponent stands tall with upright posture:
- Execute [[Single Leg X Entry]] or [[X-Guard Transition]]

Else if opponent drives forward with pressure:
- Execute [[Basic Butterfly Sweep]] or [[Elevator Sweep]]

Else if opponent pulls back defensively:
- Execute [[Arm Drag from Butterfly]] → [[Back Control]]

Else if opponent attempts to control upper body:
- Execute [[Guillotine Setup]] or [[Kimura Trap]]

## Position Metrics
- Success Rate: 65% offensive action (competition data)
- Average Time in Position: 20-45 seconds
- Sweep Probability: 55%
- Submission Entry Probability: 35%
- Position Loss Probability: 30%

## Optimal Paths
Highest-percentage sweeping path:
[[Butterfly Guard]] → [[Basic Butterfly Sweep]] → [[Side Control Top]] → [[Mount]] → submission chain

Back-taking path:
[[Butterfly Guard]] → [[Arm Drag from Butterfly]] → [[Back Control]] → [[Rear Naked Choke]] → [[Won by Submission]]

Leg entanglement path:
[[Butterfly Guard]] → [[Single Leg X Entry]] → [[Single Leg X Guard]] → [[Inside Sankaku]] → [[Inside Heel Hook]] → [[Won by Submission]]

## Computer Science Analogy
Butterfly Guard functions as a hub node with high connectivity in the BJJ state graph. It has edges connecting to many other positions, with different weights (probabilities) based on the opponent's reaction. It serves as an efficient router for transitioning between different attack systems, making it a versatile position in the overall graph structure.
