# Lockdown Half Guard Bottom
#bjj #state #half-guard #bottom #10th-planet

## State Properties
- **State ID**: S246
- **Point Value**: 0 (Neutral)
- **Position Type**: Defensive with offensive options
- **Risk Level**: Low
- **Energy Cost**: Medium
- **Time Sustainability**: Long

## State Description
Lockdown Half Guard Bottom is a specialized half guard variation developed and popularized by Eddie Bravo as a cornerstone of the 10th Planet Jiu-Jitsu system. The position is characterized by a specific leg configuration where the bottom player's inside leg threads under the opponent's trapped leg and hooks back over their own shin, creating a "lockdown" that severely restricts opponent's mobility. This configuration transforms the traditional half guard from a transitional position into a highly offensive platform for sweeps, back takes, and submissions.

The lockdown creates mechanical advantages by stretching the opponent's trapped leg, disrupting their base and preventing the common half guard passes that rely on knee-cut or backstep movements. From this position, the bottom player can execute signature 10th Planet techniques like the Electric Chair sweep, Old School sweep, and transitions to the Dog Fight position. The lockdown also facilitates the "whip-up" motion—a dynamic hip movement that off-balances opponents and creates sweep opportunities.

This position excels in no-gi grappling where the lockdown cannot be easily broken with gi grips. It provides defensive security against passes while offering multiple offensive pathways. The position's effectiveness lies in its ability to control distance, limit opponent options, and create systematic attack sequences that complement each other.

## Visual Description
You are lying on your side on the mat with one of opponent's legs trapped between yours in a unique configuration. Your inside leg (closest to opponent's body) threads under their trapped thigh and wraps around, with your foot hooking over your own shin near the knee—this creates the "lockdown" mechanism that severely restricts their leg mobility. Your outside leg hooks over opponent's back, hip, or shoulder depending on whether you're flat or coming up. Your hips are positioned close to opponent's trapped leg with your body angled on your side, allowing you to extend your hips slightly to stretch their leg and disrupt their base. Your inside arm typically establishes an underhook on their near side, while your outside arm can control their far arm, establish grips, or create frames. Your upper body can be flat on your back for defensive lockdown or elevated on your elbow as you come up toward the Dog Fight position for offensive attacks. The lockdown creates constant tension on opponent's trapped leg, preventing them from circling away or driving forward effectively, while your underhook and hip positioning work together to control their upper body and set up sweeps. This configuration gives you the ability to whip your hips upward in a dynamic motion that disrupts opponent's balance and creates opportunities for sweeps and transitions.

## Key Principles
- **Lockdown Tension**: Maintain constant tension in lockdown to stretch opponent's leg and limit mobility
- **Hip Movement**: Use dynamic hip movements (whip-ups) to off-balance opponent and create sweep opportunities
- **Underhook Priority**: Establish and maintain underhook on near side for upper body control
- **Angle Creation**: Shift angles by moving hips and shoulders to create better attack positions
- **Systematic Attacks**: Chain together lockdown-specific techniques in sequences
- **Patience Under Pressure**: Maintain lockdown control even when opponent applies pressure

## Expert Insights
- **John Danaher**: "While the lockdown is not part of my primary half guard system, I recognize its effectiveness as a control mechanism. The lockdown achieves something important—it removes opponent's ability to use their trapped leg for base and movement, which addresses one of the fundamental problems in half guard. The system's reliance on specific entries and sweeps makes it learnable and teachable, though it requires dedicated practice to execute under pressure. The position demonstrates that controlling one leg completely can be more effective than partially controlling both legs."

- **Gordon Ryan**: "I don't use the lockdown extensively in competition because my half guard system focuses on different entries to back attacks and leg locks. However, I respect the lockdown's effectiveness in neutralizing certain passing styles—particularly aggressive crossface-and-smash passers who rely on pressure. When someone locks me down, I recognize it requires patience and methodical defense to escape. For competitors who invest time in the lockdown system, it can be a high-percentage pathway to sweeps, especially against opponents unfamiliar with defending it."

- **Eddie Bravo**: "The lockdown is the foundation of the entire 10th Planet half guard game. It's not just a position—it's a control system that opens up a whole world of sweeps, submissions, and transitions. The beauty of the lockdown is that it works against larger, stronger opponents because you're using structural mechanics rather than pure strength. From the lockdown, you can go to Electric Chair, Old School, Dog Fight, and eventually back attacks or submissions. The key is maintaining constant tension and movement—never stay static. I built this system over decades of testing, and it's proven effective from white belt to black belt, gi and no-gi. The lockdown transforms half guard from a survival position into a hunting ground."

## Common Errors
- **Error**: Weak lockdown tension
  - **Consequence**: Allows opponent to maintain mobility and potentially pass guard or escape lockdown.
  - **Correction**: Maintain constant tension in lockdown by pulling your ankles tight together and extending your hips slightly to stretch opponent's trapped leg, limiting their movement options.
  - **Recognition**: If opponent can still move their trapped leg significantly or advance position, your lockdown tension is insufficient.

- **Error**: Neglecting upper body control
  - **Consequence**: Opponent can posture up, create distance, or initiate passes despite lockdown control.
  - **Correction**: Establish strong underhooks, whip-ups, or grip controls on upper body to complement lockdown, creating full-body control system that prevents opponent's escape or advancement.
  - **Recognition**: If opponent maintains upright posture or controls your head/shoulders, you lack adequate upper body control.

- **Error**: Static lockdown position
  - **Consequence**: Becomes predictable and allows opponent to defend effectively or counter your attacks.
  - **Correction**: Constantly adjust lockdown tension, change angles by moving hips, and threaten multiple attacks to keep opponent defensive and create openings for sweeps or submissions.
  - **Recognition**: If opponent settles into stable defensive position, you're being too static and need to create more movement.

- **Error**: Incorrect foot positioning
  - **Consequence**: Weakens lockdown control and makes it easier for opponent to escape or clear the lockdown.
  - **Correction**: Ensure inside foot threads deep under opponent's leg with ankle hooking over your own shin near the knee—this creates maximum leverage and control.
  - **Recognition**: If your lockdown feels loose or opponent can easily move their leg, check your foot positioning.

- **Error**: Forcing sweeps without setup
  - **Consequence**: Results in failed sweep attempts and wasted energy while opponent maintains position.
  - **Correction**: Build sweep setups through off-balancing movements, whip-ups, and controlling opponent's upper body before committing to full sweep execution—timing and preparation are essential.
  - **Recognition**: If your sweeps consistently fail or opponent easily counters, you're likely forcing them without proper setup.

- **Error**: Staying flat on back constantly
  - **Consequence**: Reduces offensive options and makes it harder to generate power for sweeps or transitions.
  - **Correction**: Come up on your elbow or work toward Dog Fight position to increase offensive capabilities while maintaining lockdown control—being on your side or partially up creates better angles for attacks.
  - **Recognition**: If you're always defensive and struggling to threaten attacks, you may be staying too flat.

- **Error**: Releasing lockdown too early
  - **Consequence**: Loses the primary control mechanism before securing next position or sweep.
  - **Correction**: Maintain lockdown until the moment of sweep completion or transition—release only when you've achieved positional advantage or secured alternative control.
  - **Recognition**: If opponent escapes during your attacks, you likely released lockdown prematurely.

## Training Drills
- **Lockdown Establishment Drill**: From standard half guard, practice quickly establishing lockdown configuration with proper foot positioning and tension. Partner provides 25% resistance initially, increasing to 75% as technique improves. Focus on threading inside leg deep and creating immediate tension. 10 repetitions per side, emphasizing speed and correct positioning.

- **Whip-Up Mechanics**: Practice whip-up motion from established lockdown—explosively extend hips upward to lift and off-balance opponent. Start with partner in passive position, then add resistance. Focus on timing, hip power, and maintaining balance. 5-minute rounds working continuous whip-ups, building hip endurance and explosive power specific to lockdown attacks.

- **Sweep Chain Flow**: From lockdown, flow through Electric Chair, Old School, Homer, and Shaolin sweeps without full execution, focusing on entries and setups. Partner maintains defensive base while you work transitions between attacks. 3-minute rounds with emphasis on recognizing when each sweep is available based on opponent's reactions. Builds pattern recognition and attack diversity.

- **Dog Fight Transitions**: Practice transitioning from flat lockdown to Dog Fight position while maintaining lockdown control. Partner applies forward pressure and attempts to flatten you. Work on using underhook and hip positioning to come up despite pressure. 10 successful transitions per round at varying resistance levels. This drill develops the crucial skill of advancing from defensive to offensive lockdown positions.

- **Live Positional Sparring**: Start in lockdown half guard and roll with progressive resistance. First 5 minutes at 50% (focus on technique), next 5 minutes at 75%, final 5 minutes at 100% intensity. Bottom player works for sweeps and back takes, top player works for passes and lockdown escapes. Reset to lockdown after each success or escape. Track sweep success rates and time to completion to measure skill development.
