# Mount
#bjj #state #dominant #pin #mount

## State Properties
- **State ID**: S004
- **Point Value**: 4 (Highly dominant position)
- **Position Type**: Offensive/Controlling
- **Risk Level**: Low to Medium
- **Energy Cost**: Medium
- **Time Sustainability**: Medium to Long

## State Description
Mount is a premier controlling position in BJJ where the top practitioner sits astride the opponent's torso with both legs straddling their body and the opponent lying on their back. This position offers exceptional control and powerful attacking opportunities while limiting the opponent's defensive options. In competition, mount is one of the highest-scoring positions, reflecting its tactical advantage.

## Visual Description

From a top-down view, the practitioner sits directly on the opponent's chest and abdomen with legs straddling both sides of the torso, knees tight against the opponent's ribs or armpits. The practitioner's hips are positioned low, sinking weight directly into the opponent's diaphragm and sternum, while the feet can hook under the opponent's legs or post on the mat for base. The practitioner's upper body remains upright or slightly forward, with hands ready to control the opponent's arms or establish grips for submissions. The opponent lies flat on their back with severely restricted movement, unable to generate effective bridging power or create space due to the top person's weight distribution and leg control. This perpendicular straddle position creates maximum pressure on the opponent's breathing while providing the top person with numerous attacking vectors for both submissions and positional transitions.

## Key Principles
- Keep knees tight to opponent's ribs/armpits
- Maintain low center of gravity with hips sinking into opponent's diaphragm
- Distribute weight through hips, not hands
- Control opponent's head and arms to prevent defensive frames
- Anticipate and counter bridge and escape attempts
- Create and maintain mechanical disadvantages for opponent

## Prerequisites
- Successful pass from side control, guard, or other position
- Control of opponent's upper body
- Opponent flat on back
- Proper balance and weight distribution

## State Invariants
- Hips positioned on opponent's torso/abdomen
- Both knees on the ground on either side of opponent
- Opponent on their back
- Top player facing opponent's head

## Defensive Responses (When Opponent Has This State)
- [[Bridge and Roll]] → [[Guard Recovery]] or [[Top Half Guard]]
- [[Elbow Escape]] → [[Half Guard Bottom]]
- [[Hip Escape]] → [[Half Guard Bottom]]
- [[Heel Drag Escape]] → [[Closed Guard Bottom]]

## Offensive Transitions (Available From This State)
- [[S-Mount Position]] → [[S-Mount Position]]
- [[High Mount Transition]] → [[High Mount]]
- [[Technical Mount Transition]] → [[Technical Mount]]
- [[Gift Wrap from Mount]] → [[Back Control]]
- [[Americana from Mount]] → [[Won by Submission]]
- [[Cross Collar Choke]] → [[Won by Submission]]
- [[Ezekiel Choke]] → [[Won by Submission]]
- [[Armbar from Mount]] → [[Armbar Control]]
- [[Triangle from Mount]] → [[Triangle Control]]
- [[Triangle Setup]] → [[Triangle Control]]

## Counter Transitions
- [[Re-establish Mount]] → [[Mount]] (against escape attempts)
- [[Technical Mount]] → [[Technical Mount]] (when opponent turns away)
- [[Back Take from Mount]] → [[Back Control]] (if opponent turns fully)

## Expert Insights
- **Danaher System**: Emphasizes the "Floating Mount" concept where weight is distributed in a way that allows quick transitions between high, low, and technical mount variations. Creates pressure sequences designed to force predictable defensive responses that expose submission opportunities.
- **Gordon Ryan**: Focuses on establishing a systematic trap system that creates no-win scenarios for the opponent. Uses the mount primarily as a control position from which to set up arm triangles and back takes, rather than emphasizing submissions directly from mount.
- **Eddie Bravo**: Often utilizes rubber guard principles even from the top position. Emphasizes the "Zombie Mount" where posture and weight distribution shut down conventional escapes while setting up gogoplatas, arm triangles, and quick transitions to the truck position.

## Common Errors
- Weight too far forward → Vulnerability to back rolls
- Posture too high → Reduced control and stability
- Knees positioned too wide → Allows space for escapes
- Hands posted too far out → Susceptible to sweeps
- Hunting submissions prematurely → Position compromise

## Training Drills
- Mount maintenance against increasing resistance
- Transition cycles between mount variations (low, high, S-mount)
- Submission sequences from mount with counters to defensive reactions
- Balance and pressure sensitivity development
- Technical mount to back control flow drills

## Related States
- [[High Mount]] - Mount with chest-to-chest connection and higher position
- [[S-Mount Position]] - Modified mount with one leg positioned for armbar attacks
- [[Technical Mount]] - Modified mount used when opponent turns to side
- [[Low Mount]] - Lower positioned mount with hips closer to opponent's hips
- [[Mounted Triangle]] - Hybrid position combining mount and triangle control

- [[Closed Guard Bottom]] - Related position

## Decision Tree
If opponent bridges strongly:
- Execute [[Float and Return]] or [[Technical Mount Transition]]

Else if opponent frames with arms:
- Execute [[Arm Isolation]] → [[Armbar from Mount]]

Else if opponent turns to side:
- Execute [[Technical Mount Transition]] → [[Back Control]]

Else (stable control established):
- Execute [[Hand Trap]] → [[Cross Collar Choke]] or [[Triangle Control]]

## Position Metrics
- Success Rate: 75% retention (competition data)
- Average Time in Position: 1-2 minutes
- Submission Probability: 55%
- Positional Advancement Probability: 40% (to back control)
- Position Loss Probability: 25%

## Optimal Submission Paths
The shortest path to submission from this position:
[[Mount]] → [[Cross Collar Choke]] → [[Won by Submission]]

High-percentage path:
[[Mount]] → [[Triangle Control]] → [[Won by Submission]]

Alternative control-oriented path:
[[Mount]] → [[Technical Mount Transition]] → [[Back Control]] → [[Rear Naked Choke]] → [[Won by Submission]]
