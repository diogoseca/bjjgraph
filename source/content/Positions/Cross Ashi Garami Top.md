## State Properties
- **State ID**: S230
- **Point Value**: 2 (Advantage position)
- **Position Type**: Offensive control position
- **Risk Level**: Medium
- **Energy Cost**: Medium
- **Time Sustainability**: Medium

## State Description
Cross Ashi Garami Top is an advanced leg entanglement position where you control your opponent's leg by crossing your legs over their trapped limb, creating a cross-body configuration. This position provides unique angles for straight ankle locks, kneebars, and serves as an excellent transitional position to more dominant leg entanglements like the saddle or inside ashi. The cross-body nature of this position allows for excellent control while maintaining offensive pressure on the opponent's lower body.

The position is characterized by your legs forming an "X" over the opponent's trapped leg, with one of your legs hooking their thigh while the other controls their ankle or shin. This creates a stable platform for attacks while limiting the opponent's ability to clear their leg or turn into you. Cross Ashi is particularly effective for athletes who prefer ankle lock attacks from different angles or who want to chain multiple leg entanglement positions together.

From a strategic standpoint, Cross Ashi Garami Top offers excellent control with moderate risk, making it a valuable position in both gi and no-gi competition. The position requires good hip mobility and awareness of transitions, as opponents will attempt to turn, stand, or counter-entangle.

## Visual Description
You are seated at an angle to your opponent with their leg trapped between yours in a crossed configuration. Your inside leg hooks over their thigh, creating a fulcrum point, while your outside leg crosses over to control their lower leg or ankle, forming an "X" pattern when viewed from above. Your hips are positioned close to their knee joint, applying constant pressure to prevent them from pulling their leg free or rotating out of the entanglement. Your upper body is typically upright or leaning slightly back to create the proper angle for submissions, with your hands controlling their foot, gi grips, or posting on the mat for balance. The opponent is usually on their back or seated, with their trapped leg extended and their free leg attempting to create defensive frames or space. This configuration restricts their movement significantly while providing you with multiple attack options and transition pathways.

## Key Principles
- **Cross-body Control**: Maintain the crossed leg configuration to control the opponent's leg at multiple points (hip, knee, ankle)
- **Hip Pressure Management**: Keep constant hip pressure on the opponent's knee joint to prevent leg extraction
- **Angle Optimization**: Position your body at the correct angle to maximize submission leverage while minimizing escape opportunities
- **Upper Body Control**: Use grips or weight distribution to prevent opponent from sitting up or turning into you
- **Transition Awareness**: Be ready to flow between different leg entanglements as opponent adjusts their defense
- **Balance and Base**: Maintain a stable base to prevent being swept or having the position reversed
- **Submission Timing**: Recognize the optimal moments to attack versus when to maintain positional control

## Offensive Transitions
From this position, you can execute:

### Submissions
- [[Straight Ankle Lock]] → [[Won by Submission]] (Success Rate: Beginner 45%, Intermediate 60%, Advanced 75%)
  - The cross-body angle provides excellent leverage for ankle attacks, especially when opponent's toes are pointed

- [[Kneebar Finish]] → [[Won by Submission]] (Success Rate: Beginner 35%, Intermediate 50%, Advanced 65%)
  - By controlling the ankle and extending your hips, create strong kneebar pressure

- [[Inside Heel Hook]] → [[Won by Submission]] (Success Rate: Beginner 25%, Intermediate 40%, Advanced 60%)
  - Advanced option in appropriate rulesets, accessed by adjusting hip position

### Position Improvements
- [[Transition to Inside Sankaku]] → [[Inside Sankaku]] (Success Rate: Beginner 40%, Intermediate 55%, Advanced 70%)
  - When opponent turns their knee away, slide to inside position for better control

- [[Back Step to Saddle]] → [[Saddle Position]] (Success Rate: Beginner 35%, Intermediate 50%, Advanced 65%)
  - Step over opponent's body to access the saddle for heel hook attacks

- [[Transition to Outside Ashi]] → [[Ashi Garami]] (Success Rate: Beginner 45%, Intermediate 60%, Advanced 72%)
  - Uncross legs and switch to standard ashi when opponent defends the cross position

### Sweeps/Reversals
- [[Elevation to X-Guard]] → [[X-Guard]] (Success Rate: Beginner 30%, Intermediate 45%, Advanced 60%)
  - If opponent begins to stand, use the leg entanglement to elevate into X-Guard

- [[Technical Stand Up]] → [[Standing Position]] (Success Rate: Beginner 35%, Intermediate 50%, Advanced 65%)
  - Maintain leg control while standing to establish dominant standing position

## Defensive Responses
When opponent has this position against you, available counters:

- [[Hip Escape and Leg Extraction]] → [[Open Guard Bottom]] (Success Rate: 35%)
  - Create space by shrimping away and pulling your leg free before they establish full control

- [[Turn Into Opponent]] → [[50-50 Guard]] (Success Rate: 30%)
  - Turn your body toward opponent to neutralize the cross angle and potentially establish 50-50

- [[Sit Up and Pressure Forward]] → [[Top Open Guard]] (Success Rate: 28%)
  - Use upper body strength to sit up and drive forward, potentially passing their legs

- [[Counter Leg Entanglement]] → [[Leg Entanglement]] (Success Rate: 25%)
  - Attack opponent's free leg with your free leg to create a counter-entanglement

- [[Roll Through Escape]] → [[Top Position]] (Success Rate: 20%)
  - Advanced escape: roll over your shoulder while extracting your leg

## Decision Tree

**If** opponent's leg is fully extended and ankle exposed:
- Execute [[Straight Ankle Lock]] → [[Won by Submission]] (Probability: 60%)
  - Reasoning: Extended leg with exposed ankle is ideal for immediate finish
- Or Execute [[Kneebar Finish]] → [[Won by Submission]] (Probability: 50%)
  - Reasoning: Extension also creates kneebar opportunity if ankle is defended

**Else if** opponent turns their knee away defensively:
- Execute [[Transition to Inside Sankaku]] → [[Inside Sankaku]] (Probability: 55%)
  - Reasoning: Their defensive turn exposes inside position for heel hook setup
- Or Execute [[Back Step to Saddle]] → [[Saddle Position]] (Probability: 50%)
  - Reasoning: Can capitalize on their rotation to enter saddle position

**Else if** opponent attempts to stand up:
- Execute [[Elevation to X-Guard]] → [[X-Guard]] (Probability: 50%)
  - Reasoning: Use their standing motion to elevate into controlling guard position
- Or Execute [[Technical Stand Up]] → [[Standing Position]] (Probability: 45%)
  - Reasoning: Match their level while maintaining leg control

**Else if** opponent creates defensive frames and pressure:
- Execute [[Transition to Outside Ashi]] → [[Ashi Garami]] (Probability: 48%)
  - Reasoning: Simplify position to standard ashi to reset control
- Or Execute [[Kneebar Finish]] → [[Won by Submission]] (Probability: 42%)
  - Reasoning: Their defensive pressure can be used against them for kneebar leverage

**Else** (balanced opponent / default):
- Maintain control and test [[Straight Ankle Lock]] → [[Won by Submission]] (Probability: 50%)
  - Reasoning: Force them to react and reveal defensive patterns
- Or Set up [[Back Step to Saddle]] → [[Saddle Position]] (Probability: 45%)
  - Reasoning: Proactively advance to more dominant position

## Expert Insights

**John Danaher**: "Cross Ashi Garami represents an important transitional position in the leg entanglement system. While not as dominant as inside ashi or the saddle, it provides unique angular advantages for ankle attacks and serves as an excellent bridge position. The key is understanding when to finish from cross ashi versus when to use it as a stepping stone to more dominant positions. The cross-body configuration creates a different mechanical problem for the opponent compared to standard ashi, forcing them to defend multiple angles simultaneously."

**Gordon Ryan**: "I use cross ashi primarily as a transition position when my opponent is defending the standard inside position. The kneebar from cross ashi is particularly high-percentage in competition because people focus so much on defending heel hooks. If you can threaten the ankle lock and kneebar equally, you create a difficult dilemma. The back step from cross ashi to the saddle is one of my highest-percentage entries because opponents don't expect the sudden positional change."

**Eddie Bravo**: "Cross Ashi fits beautifully into the 10th Planet leg lock system. We've found it works incredibly well in combination with the truck position and our rubber guard variations. The angle is perfect for setting up what we call 'the pretzel' - where you can attack the knee and ankle simultaneously. The position also flows naturally from our lockdown series, giving us another offensive option when opponents are defending the traditional 10th Planet attacks."

## Common Errors

### Error: Losing Hip Pressure During Crossover
- **Consequence**: Creates gap that allows opponent to slip their leg free or turn into you, completely negating your positional advantage and potentially putting you in a vulnerable position.
- **Correction**: Keep constant hip-to-knee pressure throughout all transitions. Think of your hips as being "glued" to their knee joint. When crossing your legs, do it in stages while maintaining pressure rather than lifting both legs simultaneously.
- **Recognition**: If you feel space between your hips and their knee, or if they can easily rotate their leg, you've lost critical pressure.

### Error: Crossing Legs Too Tight at Your Own Ankles
- **Consequence**: Restricts your own mobility and makes it difficult to adjust angles or transition to other positions. Also creates stress on your own ankle joints that can lead to injury during prolonged holds.
- **Correction**: Cross your legs with space between your ankles - they should form an "X" over their leg without your feet being locked together. This maintains control while preserving mobility.
- **Recognition**: If you feel restricted in your ability to adjust or if your ankles hurt, your cross is too tight.

### Error: Neglecting Upper Body Control
- **Consequence**: Opponent can sit up, create frames with their arms, or use their hands to strip your leg grips, making it much easier for them to escape or counter-attack.
- **Correction**: Use one or both hands to control their upper body - either pulling them down, controlling their hands, or maintaining grips on their gi/body that prevent them from sitting up effectively.
- **Recognition**: If opponent is sitting upright and actively using their hands against your legs, you've neglected upper body control.

### Error: Staying in Cross Ashi Too Long Against Standing Defense
- **Consequence**: Opponent can use their standing posture to create downward pressure and potentially pass your guard or escape the entanglement entirely.
- **Correction**: When opponent begins to stand, immediately transition to X-Guard elevation, technical stand-up, or abandon the position strategically. Don't try to hold cross ashi against a fully standing opponent.
- **Recognition**: If opponent's hips are above their knees and they're bearing weight down on you, transition immediately.

### Error: Attacking with Wrong Submission for the Angle
- **Consequence**: Wastes energy and gives opponent opportunity to escape while you're attempting a low-percentage submission from a suboptimal angle.
- **Correction**: Read the angle of their leg and foot - if toes are pointed away, attack the ankle; if knee is bent, consider the kneebar; if they're turning away, transition to inside position for heel hook.
- **Recognition**: If you're struggling to finish a submission despite good position, you may have chosen the wrong attack for the current angle.

### Error: Forgetting About Your Free Leg's Vulnerability
- **Consequence**: Opponent can attack your exposed leg with their free leg, potentially reversing the position or creating a counter-entanglement that neutralizes your offense.
- **Correction**: Keep awareness of your free leg's position and be ready to defend it. Some practitioners hook their free foot over opponent's hip or keep it posted for base.
- **Recognition**: If opponent is able to hook or attack your free leg easily, you've left yourself vulnerable.

### Error: Forcing the Cross When Standard Ashi Would Work Better
- **Consequence**: Unnecessarily complicates the position and can give opponent escape opportunities during the transition to cross configuration.
- **Correction**: Use cross ashi when it provides a specific advantage (different angle, transition to saddle, kneebar setup) rather than as default. Standard ashi is often simpler and equally effective.
- **Recognition**: If you're working harder in cross ashi than you were in standard ashi without clear benefit, you've overcomplicated.

## Training Drills

### Drill 1: Cross Ashi Entry and Maintenance (Progressive Resistance)
Start in standard ashi garami and practice crossing your legs over opponent's trapped leg while maintaining hip pressure. Begin with 0% resistance where partner remains static, progressing to 25% where they make small defensive movements, 50% where they actively try to prevent the cross, 75% where they attempt immediate escapes, and finally 100% live resistance. Focus on keeping constant hip-to-knee pressure throughout the crossing motion, never allowing space to develop. Practice both sides equally. Perform 10 repetitions each side at each resistance level, 3-5 minutes per resistance level. Common mistake: lifting hips too high during the cross, which creates escape space.

### Drill 2: Submission Chain Flow (Technical Drilling)
With partner in defensive mode (50% resistance), flow between the three main submissions from cross ashi: straight ankle lock, kneebar, and (where legal) heel hook setup. Start with ankle lock attempt, when partner defends by pointing toes or creating space, transition to kneebar. When they defend kneebar by bending leg, switch to heel hook position (or back to ankle lock in restricted rulesets). Emphasize smooth transitions without losing control. Practice 5-minute rounds, switching positions every round. Focus on reading partner's defensive reactions and immediately capitalizing with the appropriate submission. Key point: maintain crossed leg control throughout all submission transitions.

### Drill 3: Transition Matrix (Positional Flow)
Practice transitioning from cross ashi to all connected positions: inside ashi, saddle, X-guard, standard ashi, and technical stand-up. Partner provides direction cues ("inside", "saddle", "X-guard", etc.) and you must smoothly transition to that position while maintaining some form of leg control. Start slowly with clear announcements, then increase speed. Eventually partner uses actual defensive movements (turning away, sitting up, standing) and you must read and react with appropriate transition. 6-8 minute rounds, switching roles. Tracks development of positional awareness and transition fluidity.

### Drill 4: Cross Ashi vs Standing Opponent (Scenario-Based)
Start in cross ashi with partner on ground. Partner's goal is to stand up and escape or pass. Your goal is to either submit, sweep to top, or transition to controlling position (X-guard). Partner gradually increases effort from 25% to 100% over multiple rounds. Focus on recognizing the moment they commit to standing and executing immediate response (elevation, stand-up, or tactical release). 3-minute rounds, 5-6 rounds total. This drill develops timing and decision-making under pressure.

### Drill 5: Defense and Counter-Entanglement (Live Sparring)
Partner establishes cross ashi on you. Practice all defensive options: hip escape, turning in, sitting up, counter-entanglement, and roll-through escape. Start at 50% intensity and increase to 100%. Focus on creating initial space before the cross is fully locked, recognizing early warning signs. When partner attempts to re-establish, work on prevention. 4-minute rounds, switching positions every 2 minutes. Develops defensive awareness and escape timing essential for understanding the position's vulnerabilities.

- [[Ashi Garami]] - Standard leg entanglement, the foundation position that cross ashi builds upon
- [[Inside Sankaku]] - More dominant inside position that cross ashi often transitions to
- [[Saddle Position]] - Accessed via back step from cross ashi for heel hook attacks
- [[50-50 Guard]] - Mutual leg entanglement that can result from failed cross ashi or defensive counters
- [[X-Guard]] - Elevation option when opponent stands from cross ashi
- [[Single Leg X Guard]] - Alternative leg control position with different control mechanisms
- [[Kneebar Control]] - Submission position accessed directly from cross ashi

## Optimal Submission Paths

**Fastest path to submission** (direct attack):
[[Cross Ashi Garami Top]] → [[Straight Ankle Lock]] → [[Won by Submission]]
*Reasoning: When opponent's ankle is exposed and leg extended, the ankle lock is immediately available with excellent leverage from the cross angle. Success rate increases significantly if opponent's toes are pointed away from you.*

**High-percentage path** (systematic control):
[[Cross Ashi Garami Top]] → [[Transition to Inside Sankaku]] → [[Inside Heel Hook]] → [[Won by Submission]]
*Reasoning: By first improving position to inside ashi, you establish more dominant control before attempting finish. This path has higher overall success rate in competition despite extra step.*

**Alternative submission path** (kneebar finish):
[[Cross Ashi Garami Top]] → [[Kneebar Control]] → [[Kneebar Finish]] → [[Won by Submission]]
*Reasoning: When opponent defends ankle attacks by bending their leg or pointing toes, the kneebar becomes highest percentage option. Cross angle provides excellent leverage for knee attacks.*

**Saddle entry path** (positional advancement):
[[Cross Ashi Garami Top]] → [[Back Step to Saddle]] → [[Saddle Position]] → [[Inside Heel Hook]] → [[Won by Submission]]
*Reasoning: Against well-defended opponents, advancing to the saddle provides maximum control. The back step from cross ashi is one of the highest percentage saddle entries in modern leg lock game.*

**Competition sweep path** (points before submission):
[[Cross Ashi Garami Top]] → [[Elevation to X-Guard]] → [[X-Guard Sweep]] → [[Top Position]] → [[Submission Chain]] → [[Won by Submission]]
*Reasoning: In points-based competition, securing sweep points before attempting submissions can provide strategic advantage and insurance against failed submission attempts.*

## Position Metrics
- **Position Retention Rate**: Beginner 50%, Intermediate 65%, Advanced 78%
- **Advancement Probability**: Beginner 45%, Intermediate 60%, Advanced 75%
- **Submission Probability**: Beginner 35%, Intermediate 50%, Advanced 65%
- **Position Loss Probability**: Beginner 30%, Intermediate 20%, Advanced 12%
- **Average Time in Position**: 45-90 seconds

## Timing Considerations

**Best Times to Enter**:
- When transitioning from standard ashi garami and opponent defends by turning their knee away
- After securing initial leg control from guard passing situations
- When opponent is flat on their back with extended leg

**Best Times to Attack**:
- Immediately after establishing the cross when opponent hasn't set defensive frames
- When opponent is focused on defending one submission, switch to another
- After opponent attempts to escape and their leg becomes extended in the process

**Vulnerable Moments**:
- During the initial crossing of legs - this is when opponent can extract their leg
- When transitioning to other positions - brief moments of reduced control
- If opponent successfully sits up and establishes upper body control over you

**Fatigue Factors**:
- Maintaining crossed leg configuration requires constant hip and leg muscle engagement
- Position becomes harder to maintain after 90+ seconds as leg muscles fatigue
- Opponent's escape attempts become more successful as your hip pressure weakens with fatigue

## Competition Considerations

**Point Scoring**: Cross Ashi Garami typically scores as a guard position (0 points for establishing, but advantages may be awarded). In IBJJF, successful sweep from this position to top position scores 2 points. ADCC awards no points for leg entanglements but rewards submission attempts.

**Time Management**: Effective as both early and late-match position. Early in match, use for systematic attacks and position advancement. Late in match, can be used to control pace and time while hunting for submission finish.

**Rule Set Adaptations**: IBJJF restricts heel hooks until brown/black belt, making ankle locks and kneebars primary attacks. ADCC and submission-only formats allow full leg lock game from cross ashi. No-gi competition tends to favor cross ashi more than gi due to less grip fighting complexity.

**Competition Strategy**: Cross ashi works well as part of comprehensive leg entanglement system. Use it to create dilemmas - force opponent to defend multiple attack angles simultaneously. Position particularly effective against opponents who defend primarily by turning away, as this opens the back step to saddle.

## Historical Context

Cross Ashi Garami emerged as modern leg lock systems evolved, particularly through the work of John Danaher and his training group (Danaher Death Squad/New Wave). While basic leg entanglements have existed in martial arts for centuries, the systematic organization of different ashi garami variations is a relatively recent development in BJJ. The position gained prominence in professional no-gi competition in the mid-2010s as athletes like Garry Tonon, Gordon Ryan, and Eddie Cummings demonstrated its effectiveness at the highest levels. The standardization of terminology (cross ashi, inside ashi, outside ashi) helped practitioners communicate and teach these positions more effectively, leading to their widespread adoption.

## Safety Considerations

Cross Ashi Garami requires partner awareness and controlled application due to potential for knee and ankle injuries. When training, increase submission pressure slowly and respect taps immediately. Be especially careful with kneebar attacks, as knee ligaments can be damaged quickly. Beginners should practice with significant control and under supervision until they understand proper mechanics. Competition ruleset restrictions exist for safety reasons - follow them strictly. Never use this position in training until both partners understand escape options and submission mechanics.
