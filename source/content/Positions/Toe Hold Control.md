# Toe Hold Control
#bjj #state #submission #leglock #control

## State Properties
- **State ID**: S057
- **Point Value**: 3 (Dominant submission control)
- **Position Type**: Leg lock control position
- **Risk Level**: Low
- **Energy Cost**: Low to Medium
- **Time Sustainability**: Medium

## State Description
Toe Hold Control is a specialized submission position where the practitioner manipulates the opponent's foot and ankle to create a powerful rotational torque against the ankle joint, targeting the ligaments and tendons of the foot. This position is characterized by the practitioner using a figure-four grip configuration to control the opponent's foot, with one hand gripping the toes/ball of the foot and the other hand wrapped around the first wrist, creating a powerful lever for applying rotational pressure. The Toe Hold represents one of the fundamental leg lock positions in BJJ, serving as both a primary submission threat and a control position that can facilitate transitions to other leg attacks. While not as prevalent as heel hooks in modern competition, the Toe Hold remains a vital component of a complete leg lock system due to its effectiveness and applicability across various rulesets.

## Key Principles
- Establish proper figure-four grip on opponent's foot/ankle
- Control opponent's leg position to prevent defensive movement
- Create and maintain optimal angle for rotational pressure
- Apply proper wrist positioning for maximum leverage
- Prevent opponent from creating defensive frames or counters
- Manage opponent's hip mobility through strategic body positioning
- Apply controlled, progressive pressure for submission
- Maintain awareness of transition opportunities

## Prerequisites
- Understanding of foot/ankle joint mechanics
- Recognition of entry opportunities
- Knowledge of proper grip mechanics
- Ability to control opponent's leg through various positions
- Awareness of ruleset restrictions

## State Invariants
- Figure-four grip configuration on opponent's foot/ankle
- Rotational control of opponent's foot
- Practitioner positioned for optimal leverage application
- Opponent's leg mobility restricted
- Clear pathway to submission completion
- Secondary control points established on opponent's leg

## Defensive Responses (When Opponent Has This State)
- [[Boot Escape]] → [[Grip Breaking]]
- [[Hip Rotation]] → [[Angle Change]]
- [[Leg Entanglement Counter]] → [[Positional Recovery]]
- [[Forward Roll]] → [[Scramble Position]]
- [[Defensive Frame]] → [[Space Creation]]

## Offensive Transitions (Available From This State)
- [[Toe Hold Finish]] → [[Won by Submission]]
- [[Transition to Ankle Lock]] → [[Straight Ankle Lock]]
- [[Toe Hold to Knee Bar]] → [[Kneebar Control]]
- [[Toe Hold to 50/50]] → [[50/50 Guard]]
- [[Top Position Transition]] → [[Top Position]]
- [[Toe Hold to Heel Hook]] → [[Inside Heel Hook]]
- [[Cross Body Toe Hold]] → [[Modified Toe Hold]]
- [[Defensive Control Maintenance]] → [[Toe Hold Control]]

## Counter Transitions
- [[Re-establish Toe Hold]] → [[Toe Hold Control]] (against defensive movement)
- [[Switch to Ankle Lock]] → [[Straight Ankle Lock]] (if grip is compromised)
- [[Transition to Top Control]] → [[Top Position]] (under pressure)

## Expert Insights
- **Danaher System**: Places the Toe Hold within the broader hierarchy of leg attacks, viewing it as a valuable but secondary option compared to heel hooks in no-gi contexts. Emphasizes precise mechanical details for proper application, particularly focusing on grip configuration and the correct angles for applying breaking pressure. Particularly notes its value in contexts where heel hooks are restricted by rules.
- **Gordon Ryan**: Integrates the Toe Hold as a complementary attack within his leg entanglement system, often using it as a follow-up option when heel hook defenses are strong. Emphasizes the importance of controlling the opponent's hip mobility before committing to the submission, with particular focus on creating proper leverage through body positioning.
- **Eddie Bravo**: Has incorporated the Toe Hold within his 10th Planet system, developing specialized entries from positions like the Truck. When teaching the position, emphasizes creating attacking dilemmas where the opponent must choose between defending the Toe Hold or exposing themselves to other submissions, particularly in transition scenarios.

## Common Errors
- Insufficient figure-four grip pressure → Reduced leverage
- Improper angle of application → Inefficient pressure
- Premature breaking attempt → Position compromise
- Neglecting leg control → Defensive mobility
- Incorrect positioning of hands → Suboptimal leverage
- Focusing solely on submission → Missing transition opportunities

## Training Drills
- Toe Hold grip and control maintenance against progressive resistance
- Transition flows between Toe Hold and related leg attacks
- Breaking mechanics practice with controlled pressure application
- Entry practice from various positions
- Defensive recognition and counter drills

## Related States

- [[Kneebar Control]] - Common transitional option
- [[Inside Heel Hook]] - Connected leg lock
- [[50/50 Guard]] - Related leg entanglement
- [[Ashi Garami]] - Foundational leg control position

## Decision Tree
If opponent attempts to boot escape:
- Execute [[Toe Hold Finish]] or [[Transition to Ankle Lock]]

Else if opponent rotates hips defensively:
- Execute [[Toe Hold to Knee Bar]] or [[Cross Body Toe Hold]]

Else if opponent tries to roll forward:
- Execute [[Toe Hold to 50/50]] or [[Toe Hold to Heel Hook]]

Else if position becomes compromised:
- Execute [[Top Position Transition]] or [[Defensive Control Maintenance]]

## Position Metrics
- Success Rate: 65% submission probability when fully established
- Average Time in Position: 5-20 seconds
- Submission Probability: 60%
- Transition Probability: 70%
- Position Loss Probability: 25%

## Optimal Paths
Direct submission path:
[[Toe Hold Control]] → [[Toe Hold Finish]] → [[Won by Submission]]

Transition to Kneebar path:
[[Toe Hold Control]] → [[Toe Hold to Knee Bar]] → [[Kneebar Control]] → [[Won by Submission]]

Transition to Heel Hook path:
[[Toe Hold Control]] → [[Toe Hold to Heel Hook]] → [[Inside Heel Hook]] → [[Won by Submission]]

## Ruleset Considerations
The Toe Hold's legality varies across competition rulesets:
- IBJJF: Legal for brown and black belts in gi, and in certain no-gi divisions
- ADCC: Legal in all divisions
- NAGA: Legal in most adult divisions
- EBI: Legal in all divisions
- MMA: Fully legal, though less commonly seen than other submissions

These ruleset variations create strategic implications for when and how to employ the Toe Hold in different competitive contexts, making it particularly valuable in formats where certain other leg locks might be restricted.

## Computer Science Analogy
The Toe Hold Control represents a "specialized state manipulation algorithm" in the BJJ state machine, where specific mechanical leverage is created through a precisely configured grip structure. This creates a form of "mechanical advantage system" that transforms small inputs (grip pressure, wrist rotation) into amplified outputs (joint torque, ligament strain). The position exemplifies the concept of a "specialized function call" where a specific sequence of actions is executed to produce a highly specialized outcome, creating a powerful but narrow attack vector that targets a specific vulnerability in the opponent's defensive structure.
