  # FAQ Schema for Rich Snippets
  faq:
    - question: "What is the difference between kesa gatame and kuzure kesa gatame?"
      answer: "Standard kesa gatame has specific arm positioning around opponent's head and arm, while kuzure kesa gatame (broken scarf hold) represents variations where arm positioning, head control, or body angle differs from the standard form. Kuzure variations often provide different submission opportunities and control mechanics."
      category: "fundamentals"

    - question: "How do I prevent being rolled from kuzure kesa gatame?"
      answer: "Keep hips low and positioned beside opponent's body rather than over them, maintain wide base with legs spread for stability, and drive chest pressure down and across rather than directly down. Your weight distribution should make rolling you feel like rolling a heavy log rather than a ball."
      category: "defense"

    - question: "What submissions are highest percentage from kuzure kesa gatame?"
      answer: "Arm triangle and kimura are highest percentage, with arm triangle working particularly well when opponent's near arm is trapped, and kimura effective when their far arm becomes exposed during defensive movements. North-south choke also presents opportunities during position transitions."
      category: "fundamentals"

    - question: "When should I transition to north-south from kuzure kesa?"
      answer: "Transition to north-south when opponent attempts to bridge or turn away from you, when you want to attack north-south choke, or when you need to change angles to prevent their escape attempts. The rotation maintains pressure while creating new submission opportunities."
      category: "tactics"

    - question: "How does kuzure kesa gatame differ from standard side control?"
      answer: "Kuzure kesa gatame positions your body more across opponent's upper chest with hips beside rather than perpendicular to their body. This creates different pressure angles, different submission opportunities (particularly arm triangles and kimuras), and different escape challenges for the bottom person compared to standard side control."

  # Common Questions (Q&A Patterns for LLM/Chatbot)
  common_questions:
    - q: "How do I prevent getting rolled when holding kuzure kesa gatame?"
      a: "Keep your hips low and beside their body rather than elevated or over them. Spread your legs wide for base, and drive your chest pressure down and across their upper chest. If they attempt to roll, your base and low center of gravity make you extremely difficult to move."
      context: "technical"
      skill_level: "beginner"

    - q: "When should I transition to submissions vs maintaining position?"
      a: "Maintain position and pressure until opponent's defensive movements expose vulnerabilities. When their near arm extends or becomes isolated, attack arm triangle. When their far arm reaches or posts, attack kimura. When they bridge toward you, transition to north-south choke. Let their defense create openings rather than forcing attacks."
      context: "decision_making"
      skill_level: "intermediate"

    - q: "What makes kuzure kesa gatame different from standard side control?"
      a: "Your body orientation is more across their upper chest rather than perpendicular to their body. This creates different pressure mechanics, different submission opportunities (especially arm triangles and kimuras), and requires different escape strategies from bottom. The hip positioning beside rather than parallel to their body also changes the control dynamics significantly."
      context: "tactical"
      skill_level: "intermediate"

    - q: "How do I transition smoothly to north-south from kuzure kesa?"
      a: "When opponent bridges or turns away, use their movement as momentum. Maintain chest pressure throughout while rotating your body, walking your legs around their head. Your chest stays connected to their chest throughout the transition, never allowing space. Your head position changes from beside their head to opposite side of their body."
      context: "technical"
      skill_level: "advanced"

    - q: "Which variation should I use based on opponent's body type?"
      a: "Against larger opponents, standard kuzure kesa with deep underhook provides maximum control. Against smaller or more flexible opponents, variations that isolate arms work better as they can't as easily create escape space. Against defensive opponents who keep arms tight, use position transitions to create movement-based openings."
      context: "adaptation"
      skill_level: "advanced"

  # Dilemma Structures (Craig Jones Philosophy)
  dilemmas:
    - scenario: "Opponent defends arm triangle by keeping near arm tight"
      dilemma_created: "Defending near arm forces far arm to post or frame, creating kimura opportunity"
      offensive_options:
        - "Attack Far Arm Kimura → Submission or Position (Success: 50%)"
        - "Transition to North-South → New Angle (Success: 65%)"
      narrative: "As your opponent protects their trapped arm, their far arm must work to create space and defend. This defensive necessity exposes it to kimura attacks or allows you to change angles entirely."

    - scenario: "Opponent attempts bridge to create space"
      dilemma_created: "Bridge attempt exposes neck and creates transition opportunities"
      offensive_options:
        - "North-South Choke → Submission (Success: 40%)"
        - "Follow Bridge to Mount → Position Advancement (Success: 55%)"
      narrative: "Their explosive bridge attempt momentarily lifts their chest, exposing their neck and creating momentum you can redirect toward mount or north-south position. Movement creates opportunity."

    - scenario: "Opponent frames to prevent transitions"
      dilemma_created: "Creating space allows arm isolation or position advancement"
      offensive_options:
        - "Arm Triangle on Extended Arm → Submission (Success: 45%)"
        - "Step Over to Mount → Position Advancement (Success: 55%)"
      narrative: "The space they create to defend one threat becomes the pathway for another. Their frames either isolate arms for submission or create the exact space you need to advance position."

  # Knowledge Assessment Questions
  knowledge_questions:
    - question: "What is the primary mechanical difference between kuzure kesa gatame and standard side control?"
      answer: "Kuzure kesa gatame positions your body more across opponent's upper chest with hips beside their torso, while side control has your body more perpendicular. This creates different pressure angles, different base mechanics, and different submission opportunities, particularly arm triangles and kimuras in kuzure kesa."
      difficulty: "intermediate"
      category: "fundamentals"
      points: 15

    - question: "Why is keeping hips low and beside opponent's body essential in kuzure kesa gatame?"
      answer: "Low hip positioning prevents opponent from rolling you by keeping your center of gravity stable and beside rather than over them. This makes you feel like a heavy log rather than a ball when they attempt to roll, significantly reducing their escape success rates while maintaining your base and offensive options."

      points: 10

    - question: "When opponent bridges toward you from kuzure kesa, what is the highest percentage response?"
      answer: "Transition to north-south while maintaining chest pressure, using their bridge momentum to facilitate your rotation. This maintains control while potentially creating north-south choke opportunities, and prevents them from using their bridge to create escape space."

      points: 15

    - question: "What submission chain creates the most effective dilemma from kuzure kesa gatame?"
      answer: "Threaten arm triangle on the trapped near arm, forcing them to defend it tightly. This makes their far arm work to create space and defend, exposing it to kimura attacks. If they defend both arms successfully, their defensive posture allows smooth transition to north-south or mount. Every defensive choice opens another attack."
      difficulty: "advanced"
      category: "systems"
      points: 20

    - question: "How does chest pressure in kuzure kesa gatame differ from pressure in standard side control?"
      answer: "In kuzure kesa, chest pressure drives more across opponent's upper chest diagonally rather than straight down perpendicularly. This restricts breathing more effectively, makes turning more difficult, and creates different leverage mechanics. The angle of pressure combined with hip position beside their body creates unique control characteristics."

## State Description

Kuzure kesa gatame variations represent broken or modified scarf hold positions derived from judo, adapted for Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu with emphasis on control and submission opportunities. These positions score 3 points in IBJJF competition (side control points) and are characterized by chest pressure applied across the opponent's upper body, with hips positioned low beside their torso rather than perpendicular as in standard side control. The "kuzure" (broken) designation indicates variations from standard kesa gatame form, typically involving different arm positioning, head control variations, or body angle modifications.

From this position, you maintain dominant control through effective chest and hip pressure while creating submission opportunities through arm isolation, particularly arm triangles and kimuras. The position provides excellent control against larger opponents and creates attacking opportunities distinct from standard side control positions. The variations allow you to adapt based on opponent's defensive reactions and body positioning, maintaining offensive pressure while preventing common pin escapes.

The position is most effective when established from successful guard passes or during transitions where you can trap opponent's near arm, allowing you to immediately secure control and pressure. Against experienced opponents, the ability to flow between kuzure kesa variations, north-south, and mount becomes essential for maintaining offensive dominance and preventing defensive stabilization.

## Visual Description

You are positioned with your side and chest lying heavily across your opponent's upper chest and face, creating diagonal pressure from their shoulder toward opposite hip. Your hips are low and positioned beside their torso rather than elevated, with your legs spread wide for base with feet and knees contacting the mat. Your near arm (closest to their legs) typically controls their near arm either trapped under your armpit or secured with an underhook, while your far arm controls their head or far arm depending on the variation. Your chest weight drives down and across their upper body, restricting their breathing and making it extremely difficult for them to sit up or turn.

Your opponent is flat on their back beneath your diagonal pressure, with their near arm often trapped or controlled and their movement severely restricted. Their head is controlled or pressured by your chest and arm positioning, limiting their ability to create angles for escape. Their hips are beside your low hip position, making hip escape attempts require significant effort and space creation. The pressure across their chest makes breathing labored, and they must work constantly to maintain defensive structure.

This creates dominant pinning control allowing you to threaten submissions while maintaining security against roll attempts, with your diagonal body position and low hips making you feel immovable to your opponent while restricting their offensive and defensive options severely.

## Key Principles

- **Diagonal Chest Pressure**: Applying weight across opponent's upper chest diagonally restricts breathing and prevents sitting up or turning
- **Low Hip Positioning**: Keeping hips low and beside opponent's body rather than elevated prevents roll escapes
- **Wide Base Stability**: Spreading legs wide creates stable platform resistant to opponent's bridge and roll attempts
- **Arm Isolation and Control**: Controlling near arm while attacking far arm creates submission opportunities
- **Smooth Position Transitions**: Flowing between kuzure variations, north-south, and mount maintains offensive pressure
- **Pressure Distribution**: Balancing control pressure with mobility for transitions and attacks
- **Judo-BJJ Integration**: Combining judo pinning principles with BJJ submission chains

## Offensive Transitions

From this position, you can execute:

### Position Improvements

  - Transition to north-south while establishing choke configuration

## Defensive Responses

When opponent has this position against you, available counters:

- [[Bridge and Shrimp Escape]] → [[Guard Bottom]] (Success Rate: 40%)
  - Use explosive bridge to create space then shrimp to recover guard

- [[Arm Trap Counter]] → [[Reversal Position]] (Success Rate: 35%)
  - Trap controlling arm and use momentum to reverse position

- [[Hip Escape to Turtle]] → [[Turtle Position]] (Success Rate: 45%)
  - Create space with hips and turn to turtle defensive structure

- [[Maintain Defensive Frame]] → [[Kuzure Kesa Gatame Variations Top]] (Success Rate: 50%)
  - Use frames to prevent position advancement and submission attempts

## Decision Tree

**If** opponent's near arm is trapped and exposed:
- Execute [[Arm Triangle from Kuzure]] → [[Arm Triangle Control]] (Probability: 45%)
  - Reasoning: Trapped arm creates immediate arm triangle opportunity with high percentage
- Or Execute [[Kimura from Kuzure]] → [[Kimura Control]] (Probability: 50%)
  - Reasoning: When near arm defended, far arm exposure allows kimura attack

**Else if** opponent attempts to bridge or turn away:
- Execute [[Transition to North-South]] → [[North-South]] (Probability: 65%)
  - Reasoning: Movement creates opportunity for position change maintaining pressure
- Or Execute [[North-South Choke]] → [[North-South Choke Control]] (Probability: 40%)
  - Reasoning: Bridge attempt exposes neck to choke during transition

**Else if** opponent creates space with frames:
- Execute [[Transition to Mount]] → [[Mount]] (Probability: 55%)
  - Reasoning: Space allows stepping over to mount position
- Or Execute [[Transition to Standard Kesa Gatame]] → [[Kesa Gatame]] (Probability: 70%)
  - Reasoning: Adjust position to eliminate frames and reestablish control

**Else** (balanced opponent / default):
- Maintain Pressure and Wait (Probability: 60%)
  - Reasoning: Solid control creates fatigue and future opportunities
- Or Execute [[Transition to North-South]] → [[North-South]] (Probability: 65%)
  - Reasoning: Position change creates new attacking angles

## Expert Insights

**John Danaher**: Kuzure kesa gatame represents intelligent adaptation of judo pinning methodology to Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu's submission-focused approach. The key mechanical advantage lies in the diagonal chest pressure which simultaneously restricts breathing, limits mobility, and creates arm isolation opportunities. Understanding pressure application angles and maintaining low hip positioning creates control that feels overwhelming to bottom player while preserving top player's offensive options and transition mobility.

**Gordon Ryan**: In competition, I use kuzure kesa variations primarily when transitioning from guard passes and the position naturally presents itself. The arm triangle opportunities from kuzure kesa are particularly high-percentage because opponent's near arm is already compromised. The position also exhausts opponents rapidly through chest pressure, making it valuable for pace control in longer matches where I want to drain their energy before advancing to more attacking positions.

**Eddie Bravo**: Kuzure kesa gatame integrates interestingly with lockdown and twister concepts when adapted creatively. While traditional judo focuses on pinning, from BJJ perspective these variations create unique submission chains not commonly seen in standard side control or mount. The diagonal body position creates different leverage angles for attacks, and opponents often don't have as refined defenses against judo-based positions, creating strategic advantages through their unfamiliarity.

## Common Errors

### Error: Elevating hips too high off the mat
- **Consequence**: Raises center of gravity making you vulnerable to roll escapes, reduces chest pressure effectiveness allowing opponent to breathe and recover, and compromises base stability making position maintenance difficult
- **Correction**: Keep hips low and weighted beside opponent's torso, maintaining contact with mat through knees and feet for stable base
- **Recognition**: If opponent can easily roll you or bridge you off, your hips are too elevated

### Error: Driving pressure straight down instead of diagonally across
- **Consequence**: Reduces effectiveness of control, makes it easier for opponent to turn or sit up, and limits your transition options by making body positioning too centered
- **Correction**: Drive chest pressure diagonally across opponent's upper chest from shoulder toward opposite hip, creating crossways pressure
- **Recognition**: Opponent maintains mobility and doesn't appear as restricted despite your pressure

### Error: Gripping or controlling too high on opponent's body
- **Consequence**: Allows them to create hip escape space more easily, reduces effectiveness of chest pressure, and makes transitions to submissions less available
- **Correction**: Maintain control low on their body, ensuring chest pressure stays on upper chest and arms controlled near shoulders
- **Recognition**: Opponent creating significant space with hip movements

### Error: Rushing submission attempts without securing position
- **Consequence**: Compromises control creating escape opportunities, reduces submission success rates due to poor positioning, and allows opponent to recover guard or better position
- **Correction**: Establish secure kuzure kesa control with effective pressure before attempting submissions, ensuring base and pressure are optimal
- **Recognition**: Frequently losing position during submission attempts indicates rushing

### Error: Not transitioning between variations when opponent defends
- **Consequence**: Allows opponent to establish consistent defensive strategy, reduces attacking opportunities, and makes you predictable enabling them to anticipate movements
- **Correction**: Actively read opponent's defensive reactions and flow between kuzure kesa variations, north-south, and mount to create new angles
- **Recognition**: Stalling in position without progress indicates need for variation

## Training Drills

### Drill 1: Kuzure Kesa Pressure and Base Drill
Practice establishing kuzure kesa gatame control and maintaining it against partner's progressive bridge and roll attempts. Start with 0% resistance allowing you to feel proper chest pressure angle, hip positioning, and base width. Progress to 25% resistance where partner attempts gentle bridges, then 50% with active bridge attempts, and finally 75% with explosive rolls. Focus on keeping hips low, driving diagonal chest pressure, and maintaining wide leg base throughout. Partner provides feedback on moments when your base compromised or pressure reduced. Perform 3 sets of 2-minute holds at each resistance level. Success metric: maintaining position through 80%+ of escape attempts at 75% resistance.

### Drill 2: Position Transition Flow Drill
From kuzure kesa gatame, practice smooth transitions to standard kesa gatame, north-south, and mount with partner providing positional feedback. Start with static transitions from stable kuzure kesa, focusing on maintaining chest pressure throughout movement. Progress to dynamic transitions where partner creates movement forcing you to adapt. Practice reading partner's bridge, turn, or frame reactions and responding with appropriate position transition. Each transition should feel seamless with no pressure loss or base compromise. Perform 5 repetitions of each transition (kuzure to kesa, kuzure to north-south, kuzure to mount) at 50% resistance. Success metric: smooth transition completion maintaining control in 80%+ of attempts.

### Drill 3: Submission Recognition and Setup Drill
From controlled kuzure kesa gatame, partner presents specific defensive postures (near arm trapped, far arm posting, bridge attempt, frame creation) and you respond with appropriate submission or transition. Start with partner calling out defensive posture clearly, then progress to silent indication requiring recognition. Practice identifying arm triangle opportunities when near arm trapped, kimura when far arm exposed, north-south choke when bridge occurs. Focus on maintaining position security throughout setup phase. Perform 5 repetitions of each scenario at 50% resistance, focusing on proper submission mechanics and position retention. Success metric: correctly identifying and initiating appropriate attack within 5 seconds of defensive posture presentation.

## Optimal Submission Paths

**Fastest path to submission** (direct attack):
[[Kuzure Kesa Gatame Variations Top]] → [[Arm Triangle from Kuzure]] → [[Won by Submission]]
*Reasoning: When opponent's near arm is already trapped, immediate arm triangle provides fastest finish with success rates of 30-60% depending on skill level and setup quality*

**High-percentage path** (systematic):
[[Kuzure Kesa Gatame Variations Top]] → [[Transition to North-South]] → [[North-South Choke]] → [[Won by Submission]]
*Reasoning: Transitioning to north-south first creates better angle for choke while maintaining control, increasing success rates through superior positioning*

**Alternative submission path** (arm attack focused):
[[Kuzure Kesa Gatame Variations Top]] → [[Kimura from Kuzure]] → [[Kimura Control]] → [[Won by Submission]]
*Reasoning: When near arm defended, far arm kimura provides high-percentage alternative that forces opponent into difficult defensive dilemma*

**Position advancement path** (mount to submission):
[[Kuzure Kesa Gatame Variations Top]] → [[Transition to Mount]] → [[Armbar from Mount]] → [[Won by Submission]]
*Reasoning: When direct submissions defended, mounting provides point advantage and creates superior submission opportunities through dominant position*

**Dilemma creation path** (multi-threat):
[[Kuzure Kesa Gatame Variations Top]] → [[Arm Triangle Threat]] → [[Kimura from Kuzure]] → [[Won by Submission]]
*Reasoning: Threatening arm triangle forces defensive reaction exposing far arm to kimura attack, creating highest percentage submission through forced dilemma*
