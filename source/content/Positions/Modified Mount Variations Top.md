  # FAQ Schema for Rich Snippets
  faq:
    - question: "When should I transition from standard mount to modified mount variations?"
      answer: "Transition to modified mount variations when opponent establishes strong frames, creates defensive structure, or when specific submission opportunities present themselves. Modified variations provide enhanced control and attacking options based on opponent's reactions."
      category: "tactics"

    - question: "What is the difference between high mount and S-mount?"
      answer: "High mount involves sliding knees higher on opponent's chest to restrict hip escapes, while S-mount rotates the body to create an S-shape with legs, specifically designed for armbar setups. Both are variations that enhance control and create specific submission opportunities."
      category: "fundamentals"

    - question: "How do I prevent being rolled when attempting submissions from mount?"
      answer: "Maintain wide base with knees, keep weight distributed low and forward, and avoid reaching or overextending when attacking. When setting up submissions, establish secure grips and position first before committing to the finish."
      category: "defense"

    - question: "What are the highest percentage submissions from modified mount?"
      answer: "Americana, armbar, and collar chokes are highest percentage, with success rates increasing significantly when position is properly established. Advanced practitioners also find success with ezekiel chokes and transitions to technical mount for back takes."
      category: "fundamentals"

    - question: "How do I maintain mount when opponent turns to their side?"
      answer: "Transition to technical mount by extending one leg and maintaining hip pressure. Follow opponent's movement, keeping chest weight on their upper back while controlling their far shoulder. This position leads naturally to back control."

  # Common Questions (Q&A Patterns for LLM/Chatbot)
  common_questions:
    - q: "When should I advance to high mount vs staying in standard mount?"
      a: "Advance to high mount when opponent establishes strong elbow frames creating distance. The higher position restricts their hip escape options and often forces arm exposure as they try to remove your weight."
      context: "decision_making"
      skill_level: "intermediate"

    - q: "How do I prevent being reversed when attempting armbars from mount?"
      a: "Establish secure grips on the arm before committing to the armbar transition. Keep your weight distributed properly and swing your leg over smoothly rather than in one explosive movement. Control their head and use your free hand to post if they attempt to roll."
      context: "technical"
      skill_level: "beginner"

    - q: "What if opponent turtles or turns to side while I'm in mount?"
      a: "Immediately transition to technical mount by extending one leg while maintaining hip pressure on their upper back. This position controls their turn and creates opportunities for back control or maintaining dominant position."
      context: "adaptation"
      skill_level: "intermediate"

    - q: "Which submission should I focus on from mount as a beginner?"
      a: "Americana and collar chokes are highest percentage for beginners. Americana is more forgiving technically, while collar chokes give you time to establish grips due to their slower setup. Both allow you to maintain strong position throughout the attempt."
      context: "tactical"
      skill_level: "beginner"

    - q: "How do I create submission opportunities when opponent keeps arms tight to body?"
      a: "Use strategic movements and feints to force reactions. Threaten ezekiel or collar chokes to make them raise arms, creating Americana opportunities. Alternatively, transition to high mount or S-mount which inherently creates vulnerabilities as opponent adjusts."
      context: "offensive"
      skill_level: "advanced"

  # Coaching Cues (Natural Language for Instruction)

  # Dilemma Structures (Craig Jones Philosophy)
  dilemmas:
    - scenario: "Opponent establishes strong elbow frames"
      dilemma_created: "Defending against high mount advancement requires extended arms, creating submission opportunities"
      offensive_options:
        - "Transition to High Mount → Enhanced Control (Success: 65%)"
        - "Attack Extended Arm → Americana or Armbar (Success: 50%)"
      narrative: "As your opponent frames to create distance, they face a choice: allow you to advance position or expose their arms to submission attacks. Either option strengthens your position."

    - scenario: "Opponent keeps arms tight to body defensively"
      dilemma_created: "Protecting arms allows technical mount and back control opportunities"
      offensive_options:
        - "Transition to Technical Mount → Back Take Setup (Success: 70%)"
        - "Establish Choke Grips → Force Arm Movement (Success: 45%)"
      narrative: "Your opponent's tight defensive posture protects against immediate arm attacks but allows you to control their movement and work toward their back. The more they defend, the more you control."

    - scenario: "Opponent attempts bridge and roll escape"
      dilemma_created: "Escape attempt creates transition opportunities and submission setups"
      offensive_options:
        - "Follow Movement → Maintain Mount (Success: 60%)"
        - "Transition to Armbar During Roll (Success: 45%)"
      narrative: "As they commit to the escape, their movement creates openings. By following their energy, you either maintain dominant position or capitalize on the vulnerabilities their attempt created."

  # Narrative Generation Prompts
  narrative_prompts:
    entry: "You establish modified mount control, adjusting your position based on your opponent's defensive structure. Your weight settles forward as your base widens, creating a stable platform for attack."
    control: "From modified mount, you feel your opponent's every movement beneath you. Your weight pressure limits their options while your hands remain free to threaten multiple submissions simultaneously."
    attack_initiation: "You recognize the opening and begin your attack sequence, shifting your weight and adjusting your grips as your opponent's defensive choices narrow."
    success: "Your technique connects perfectly as your opponent realizes their defensive options have evaporated. The position you established made this moment inevitable."
    failure: "Your opponent's defensive reaction neutralizes your attempt, but you maintain your dominant mount position and begin setting up your next attack."
    position_loss: "Your opponent's explosive movement catches you off-balance, forcing you to reestablish position and defensive structure as they work to improve."

    - question: "Why is weight distribution forward and down more effective than sitting upright in mount?"
      answer: "Forward weight distribution increases pressure on opponent's chest making breathing difficult, restricts their movement, and keeps your center of gravity low making bridge escapes much less effective. Upright posture raises center of gravity making you vulnerable to being rolled."

    - question: "When opponent establishes strong elbow frames, which mount variation should you transition to and why?"
      answer: "High mount is most effective because sliding knees higher on their chest restricts hip escape options and often forces them to either expose arms or accept the advanced position. The higher position also increases pressure making frames less effective."

    - question: "How do you maintain position when opponent attempts bridge and roll escape?"
      answer: "Maintain wide base with knees, keep weight low and forward, and follow their rolling motion rather than resisting. Base out with your hands if necessary and use your hips to counter their bridge. The key is not fighting the movement but flowing with it while maintaining control."

    - question: "What submission chain creates the highest percentage dilemma from modified mount?"
      answer: "Threaten high mount advancement to force elbow frames, then attack the extended arms with Americana or armbar. If they keep arms tight, transition to technical mount for back control. This chain ensures opponent must choose between accepting advanced position or exposing submission targets."

## State Description

Modified mount variations represent strategic adjustments from standard mount position, providing the top practitioner with enhanced control options and submission opportunities based on the bottom opponent's defensive reactions. These variations score 4 points in IBJJF competition and are characterized by modifications to knee placement, hip positioning, and weight distribution that optimize specific attacking scenarios. The position maintains dominant control while adapting to opponent's defensive strategies.

From this position, you have multiple pathways for advancement including high mount, S-mount, and technical mount, each creating specific submission opportunities and controlling different defensive responses. The ability to flow between these variations makes it difficult for opponents to establish consistent defensive strategies. Modified mount variations serve as a control position that sets up finishing techniques while maintaining positional dominance throughout transitions.

The position is most effective when you have established strong base and forward weight distribution, allowing you to threaten multiple attacks simultaneously while maintaining security against escape attempts. Against more experienced opponents who defend standard mount effectively, these variations become essential for creating openings and advancing position toward back control or submissions.

## Visual Description

You are positioned on top of your opponent who is flat on their back, with your knees on the mat on either side of their torso. Your hips are weighted forward and down onto their chest or upper abdomen, creating constant pressure that restricts their breathing and movement. Your weight is distributed through your knees and hips rather than sitting upright, keeping your center of gravity low and making you difficult to bridge or roll. Your chest leans forward over their upper body, and your hands are positioned for grips, frames, or submission setups depending on their defensive posture.

Your opponent is flat on their back beneath you, with their movement severely restricted by your weight and position. Their arms are typically defensive, either framing against your chest to create distance or tucked tight to their body to protect from submissions. Their hips are controlled by your weight and knee positioning, limiting their ability to shrimp or bridge effectively. The spatial relationship creates multiple angles for attack while your stable base prevents their escape attempts.

This creates strategic control allowing you to threaten multiple submissions and position advancements while maintaining security against common mount escapes, with your ability to transition between variations forcing opponent into continuous defensive decision-making under pressure.

## Key Principles

- **Adaptive Positioning**: Modifying mount based on opponent's defensive reactions optimizes control and creates specific opportunities
- **Forward Weight Distribution**: Maintaining hips heavy and forward restricts opponent's movement while keeping base secure against bridge attempts
- **Base Maintenance**: Wide knee placement and low center of gravity provide stability against escape attempts
- **Submission Chain Integration**: Connecting multiple attack threats creates dilemmas where defending one opens another
- **Variation Recognition**: Understanding which mount variation to apply based on opponent's posture and defensive strategy
- **Patience and Timing**: Waiting for opponent to expose vulnerabilities rather than forcing attacks maintains position security
- **Pressure Application**: Constant chest and hip pressure fatigues opponent while restricting their defensive options

## Offensive Transitions

From this position, you can execute:

### Position Improvements
- [[Transition to High Mount]] → [[High Mount Top]] (Success Rate: Beginner 50%, Intermediate 65%, Advanced 80%)
  - Slide knees higher on chest to restrict hip escapes and create submission opportunities

- [[Transition to S-Mount]] → [[S-Mount Top]] (Success Rate: Beginner 40%, Intermediate 55%, Advanced 70%)
  - Rotate body and adjust legs to S-configuration for armbar setups

- [[Transition to Technical Mount]] → [[Technical Mount Top]] (Success Rate: Beginner 45%, Intermediate 60%, Advanced 75%)
  - Extend one leg to control opponent's turn and create back take opportunities

### Submissions
- [[Americana from Mount]] → [[Americana Control]] (Success Rate: Beginner 30%, Intermediate 45%, Advanced 60%)
  - Isolate and control arm for shoulder lock submission

- [[Armbar from Mount]] → [[Armbar Control]] (Success Rate: Beginner 35%, Intermediate 50%, Advanced 70%)

  - Establish deep collar grips and apply choking pressure

## Defensive Responses

When opponent has this position against you, available counters:

- [[Bridge and Roll Escape]] → [[Guard Top]] (Success Rate: 35%)
  - Use explosive bridge to off-balance and roll mounted opponent

- [[Elbow Escape]] → [[Half Guard Bottom]] (Success Rate: 40%)
  - Create frames and shrimp to recover guard position

- [[Hip Escape to Guard]] → [[Guard Bottom]] (Success Rate: 30%)
  - Use hip movement to create distance and reestablish guard structure

- [[Arm Trap Defense]] → [[Modified Mount Variations Top]] (Success Rate: 45%)
  - Trap attacking arm to prevent submissions while maintaining defensive structure

## Decision Tree

**If** opponent frames with both arms extended:
- Execute [[Transition to High Mount]] → [[High Mount Top]] (Probability: 65%)
  - Reasoning: Frames indicate need to advance position for better control and submission opportunities
- Or Execute [[Transition to S-Mount]] → [[S-Mount Top]] (Probability: 55%)
  - Reasoning: S-Mount bypasses frames and creates immediate armbar threat

**Else if** opponent exposes arm away from body:
- Execute [[Americana from Mount]] → [[Americana Control]] (Probability: 50%)
  - Reasoning: Exposed arm creates immediate submission opportunity with high percentage
- Or Execute [[Armbar from Mount]] → [[Armbar Control]] (Probability: 45%)
  - Reasoning: Extended arm allows smooth armbar transition

**Else if** opponent turtles or turns to side:
- Transition to [[Technical Mount Top]] (Probability: 70%)
  - Reasoning: Technical mount controls turn and creates natural pathway to back control

**Else** (balanced opponent / default):
- Execute [[Cross Collar Choke from Mount]] → [[Cross Collar Control]] (Probability: 45%)
  - Reasoning: Tight defensive posture allows time to establish choke grips methodically
- Or Execute [[Ezekiel from Mount]] → [[Ezekiel Control]] (Probability: 40%)
  - Reasoning: Alternative attack when opponent maintains defensive structure

## Expert Insights

**John Danaher**: Modified mount variations represent intelligent positional adaptation based on opponent's defensive strategies. The key is understanding that standard mount control must evolve when opponents develop effective defensive structures. By varying your knee placement, hip positioning, and weight distribution, you create different tactical scenarios each requiring different defensive responses, overwhelming opponent's ability to maintain consistent defense while creating superior attacking opportunities.

**Gordon Ryan**: In competition, I use mount variations constantly based on how opponents react to initial control. High mount is my preference for restricting movement and forcing mistakes, while S-mount and technical mount create specific submission and back take opportunities. The ability to flow between variations smoothly prevents opponents from establishing rhythm in their defense and maintains constant offensive pressure that scores submissions at elite levels.

**Eddie Bravo**: Modified mount variations integrate perfectly with submission chains and creative attacking sequences. Each variation creates unique submission opportunities that can be connected in unexpected ways. Technical mount particularly interests me as it leads naturally to truck position and back control, creating non-traditional pathways that opponents struggle to defend when they're focused on standard mount escapes.

## Common Errors

### Error: Sitting upright with weight too high
- **Consequence**: Raises center of gravity making you vulnerable to bridge and roll escapes, reduces pressure on opponent allowing them to breathe and recover energy, and makes it difficult to react to their explosive movements effectively
- **Correction**: Keep weight forward and hips heavy on opponent's chest, leaning your torso over their upper body while maintaining wide knee base for stability
- **Recognition**: If opponent can easily bridge or you feel unstable, your weight is too high

### Error: Narrow knee placement or bringing knees together
- **Consequence**: Reduces base width making you vulnerable to being rolled, allows opponent to create hip escape angles more easily, and compromises your stability when they resist or attempt to turn
- **Correction**: Maintain wide base with knees spread on either side of opponent's torso, creating stable platform that resists rolling attempts
- **Recognition**: Feeling unstable or getting rolled frequently indicates narrow base

### Error: Forcing submission attempts without securing position first
- **Consequence**: Compromises mount control creating escape opportunities, allows opponent to roll or recover guard during your overcommitment, and reduces submission success rates due to poor positioning
- **Correction**: Establish secure position and control before attempting submissions, ensuring your base and weight distribution are optimal
- **Recognition**: Frequently losing mount during submission attempts indicates rushing

### Error: Not transitioning between variations based on opponent's defense
- **Consequence**: Allows opponent to establish consistent defensive strategy, reduces attacking opportunities, and makes you predictable allowing them to anticipate your movements
- **Correction**: Actively read opponent's defensive posture and transition between mount variations to create new angles and opportunities
- **Recognition**: Stalling in position without progress indicates need for variation

### Error: Allowing opponent to turn to side without following
- **Consequence**: Loses mount position entirely as they escape to turtle or recover guard, wastes dominant position advantage, and allows them to reset to neutral or better position
- **Correction**: When opponent turns, immediately transition to technical mount maintaining hip pressure while controlling their far shoulder
- **Recognition**: If opponent successfully turns to side and you lose position, you failed to follow their movement

## Training Drills

### Drill 1: Mount Variation Flow Drill
Practice smooth transitions between standard mount, high mount, S-mount, and technical mount with partner providing progressive feedback on your base and pressure. Start with 0% resistance allowing you to feel proper mechanics and weight distribution in each variation. Progress to 25% resistance where partner attempts gentle escapes, then 50% where they actively defend but don't explosively counter. Focus on maintaining constant pressure throughout transitions, keeping base wide, and moving smoothly between variations based on partner's positioning. Perform 3 sets of 2-minute continuous flow, resetting to standard mount each time partner provides feedback on pressure loss or base compromise.

### Drill 2: Submission Chain Recognition Drill
From modified mount, partner presents specific defensive postures (frames extended, arms tight, turning to side) and you respond with appropriate submission or position advancement. Start with partner calling out the defensive posture clearly, then progress to silent indication where you must recognize it. Practice chaining attacks together: high mount to armbar, Americana to ezekiel, technical mount to back take. Perform 5 repetitions of each defensive scenario with 50% resistance, focusing on smooth recognition and response rather than forcing finishes. Success metric: correctly identifying and responding to defensive posture within 3 seconds.

### Drill 3: Mount Retention Against Bridge Attempts
Partner performs progressive bridge and roll escape attempts while you maintain position using proper base and weight distribution. Start with slow, controlled bridges at 25% effort, focusing on your base and counter-pressure. Progress to 50%, 75%, and finally 100% explosive bridges. Key focuses: keeping weight forward and low, maintaining wide base, following their rolling motion rather than resisting, and using hip pressure to counter. Perform 3 sets of 10 bridge attempts at each resistance level, with partner providing feedback on moments when your base compromised or weight distribution failed. Goal: maintain mount through 80%+ of attempts at 100% resistance.

## Optimal Submission Paths

**Fastest path to submission** (direct attack):
[[Modified Mount Variations Top]] → [[Americana from Mount]] → [[Won by Submission]]
*Reasoning: When opponent exposes arm, immediate Americana attack from solid base provides fastest finish with success rates of 30-60% depending on skill level*

**High-percentage path** (systematic):
[[Modified Mount Variations Top]] → [[Transition to High Mount]] → [[Armbar from Mount]] → [[Armbar Control]] → [[Won by Submission]]
*Reasoning: Advancing to high mount first restricts opponent's options and creates better armbar angle with increased success rates due to superior position*

**Alternative submission path** (choke-focused):
[[Modified Mount Variations Top]] → [[Cross Collar Choke from Mount]] → [[Won by Submission]]
*Reasoning: When opponent maintains tight defensive structure, collar choke allows methodical grip establishment without position compromise, effective against larger opponents*

**Technical progression path** (back take):
[[Modified Mount Variations Top]] → [[Transition to Technical Mount]] → [[Back Control]] → [[Rear Naked Choke]] → [[Won by Submission]]
*Reasoning: When opponent turns to side defensively, technical mount to back control progression provides highest percentage path to back attacks*

**Competition-focused path** (point + submission):
[[Modified Mount Variations Top]] → [[Transition to S-Mount]] → [[Armbar from Mount]] → [[Armbar Control]] → [[Won by Submission]]
*Reasoning: S-mount transition maintains mount points while creating high-percentage armbar setup, maximizing both positional points and submission probability in competition*
