## State Properties
- **State ID**: S065

- **Position Type**: Offensive/Controlling/Transitional
- **Risk Level**: Medium
- **Energy Cost**: Medium to High
- **Time Sustainability**: Short to Medium

## State Description
Knee on Belly (KOB) is a dominant control position where the top practitioner places one knee on the opponent's abdomen or sternum while keeping the other foot on the ground. This creates a powerful pinning position that combines pressure, mobility, and control while maintaining the ability to quickly transition to other dominant positions or submissions. Unlike more static controlling positions, Knee on Belly creates a dynamic control state that forces defensive reactions while providing exceptional leverage for striking in self-defense scenarios. It serves as both a controlling position in its own right and as a tactical bridge between side control and mount or back control.

## Key Principles
- Distribute weight precisely through the knee on opponent's abdomen/sternum
- Maintain base with outside foot positioned for mobility
- Control opponent's near arm to prevent defensive frames
- Keep upper body forward to apply pressure and prevent escapes
- Establish head control or collar grip in gi scenarios
- Maintain upright posture to increase pressure and mobility
- Create and exploit off-balancing mechanics
- Be prepared to follow opponent's defensive movements

## Prerequisites
- Successful transition from side control or other dominant position
- Control of opponent's upper body
- Neutralization of defensive frames
- Proper weight distribution and base
- Opponent relatively flat on back

## State Invariants
- One knee placed firmly on opponent's abdomen/sternum
- Other foot posted on the mat for base and mobility
- Upper body control established
- Opponent primarily on their back
- Maintenance of pressure through knee

## Defensive Responses (When Opponent Has This State)
- [[Frame and Shrimp]] → [[Guard Recovery]]
- [[Underhook and Turn]] → [[Turtle Position]]
- [[Bridge and Roll]] → [[Guard Recovery]]
- [[Half Guard Recovery]] → [[Half Guard Bottom]]
- [[Technical Stand-up]] → [[Standing Position]]

## Offensive Transitions (Available From This State)
- [[Transition to Mount]] → [[Mount]]
- [[Back Step]] → [[Back Control]]
- [[Return to Side Control]] → [[Side Control]]
- [[Far Side Armbar]] → [[Armbar Control]]
- [[Baseball Choke Setup]] → [[Baseball Bat Choke]]
- [[Nearside Armbar]] → [[Armbar Control]]

## Counter Transitions
- [[Re-establish KOB]] → [[Knee on Belly]] (against escape attempts)
- [[Switch Sides KOB]] → [[Knee on Belly]] (when opponent turns)
- [[Floating KOB]] → [[Knee on Belly]] (to follow opponent movement)

## Expert Insights
- **Danaher System**: Emphasizes Knee on Belly as a dynamic control position focused on creating predictable defensive reactions that expose the opponent to more dominant positions or submissions. Views KOB less as a destination and more as a pressure point that forces opponents into predictable movement patterns that can be exploited. Places particular emphasis on controlling the near-side arm to limit defensive options.
- **Gordon Ryan**: Utilizes KOB as a transitional position in his systematic approach to positional advancement. Often employs a "floating" knee on belly that allows for quick transitions to mount or back control based on the opponent's reactions. Favors creating submission opportunities from KOB through initial pressure that forces defensive errors.
- **Eddie Bravo**: Has adapted the position for no-gi scenarios with emphasis on head control rather than traditional collar grips. Often uses KOB as a pathway to leg entanglements or the "truck" position, departing from more traditional applications. Emphasizes the use of posting and base to create pressure without relying on gi grips.

## Common Errors
- Insufficient base with outside leg → Vulnerability to sweeps
- Knee placement too high or low → Reduced control and pressure
- Poor posture and weight distribution → Decreased pressure effectiveness
- Neglecting upper body control → Defensive counters
- Overcommitting weight → Vulnerability to reversal when opponent turns
- Telegraphing transitions → Predictable offense
- Staying too long in position → Opponent adapts defensively

## Training Drills
- Knee on Belly transitions from side control
- Dynamic KOB pressure application with varying resistance
- Submission entries from KOB position
- KOB maintenance against escape attempts
- Positional flow sequences (Side Control → KOB → Mount/Back)
- KOB to submission timing drills
- KOB side-switching drills

## Decision Tree
If opponent frames strongly against knee:
- Execute [[Far Side Armbar]] or [[Kimura Trap]]

Else if opponent turns away from you:
- Execute [[Back Step]] → [[Back Control]]

Else if opponent turns toward you:
- Execute [[Step Over]] → [[Mount]]

Else if opponent attempts to recover guard:
- Execute [[Switch to Side Control]] → [[Side Control]]

## Position Metrics
- Success Rate: 70% control maintenance (competition data)
- Average Time in Position: 20-45 seconds
- Mount Transition Probability: 40%
- Back Take Probability: 35%
- Submission Probability: 25%
- Position Loss Probability: 30%

## Optimal Paths
Primary control path:
[[Side Control]] → [[Knee on Belly]] → [[Mount]] → [[High Mount]] → submission chain

Back-taking path:
[[Side Control]] → [[Knee on Belly]] → [[Back Step]] → [[Back Control]] → [[Rear Naked Choke]] → [[Won by Submission]]

Direct submission path:
[[Side Control]] → [[Knee on Belly]] → [[Far Side Armbar]] → [[Armbar Finish]] → [[Won by Submission]]

## Computer Science Analogy
Knee on Belly functions as an "event listener" in the BJJ state machine, creating a high-pressure trigger point that forces the opponent to generate events (defensive responses) that can be captured and handled by appropriate callback functions (follow-up techniques). This creates a reactive control flow that efficiently processes opponent inputs and directs them toward predetermined pathways. The position's blend of stability and mobility also resembles a "stateful load balancer" that can dynamically shift resources (weight and pressure) in response to changing system demands (opponent's defensive movements).
