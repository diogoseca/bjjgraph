# Modified Mount Top
#bjj #state #mount #dominant #technical

## State Properties
- **State ID**: S214
- **Point Value**: 4 (Mount position)
- **Position Type**: Offensive/Controlling
- **Risk Level**: Low to Medium
- **Energy Cost**: Low to Medium
- **Time Sustainability**: Medium to Long

## State Description
Modified Mount Top refers to various non-standard mount configurations where the top practitioner has adjusted their leg positioning, weight distribution, or body alignment from traditional mount to address opponent's defensive reactions or to set up specific attacks. This includes positions like S-Mount (one leg extended for armbar setup), Technical Mount (one leg hooking opponent's far arm), High Mount (chest-to-chest connection with elevated position), and other variations. These modifications sacrifice some mounting stability for increased attacking power or to counter specific escape attempts.

The modified mount family represents the evolution of mount control in modern BJJ. As defensive techniques improved, the static full mount became less dominant. Practitioners developed these variations to maintain offensive pressure while adapting to opponent's movements. Each modification serves specific tactical purposes: S-Mount maximizes armbar threat, Technical Mount prepares back takes, High Mount prevents bridge escapes. Understanding when and how to modify your mount position is essential for high-level attacking from top.

## Visual Description

Modified Mount Top variations share common elements while differing in specific details. Generally, the top practitioner maintains a mounted position with their weight on the opponent's torso, but with altered leg configurations. In S-Mount, one leg extends straight past the opponent's head while the other maintains a traditional mount position, creating an "S" shape. In Technical Mount, one leg hooks under the opponent's far arm while the other posts wide for base. In High Mount, both knees remain tight but the practitioner's chest moves up toward the opponent's face, creating a more upright, smothering position. The opponent remains on their back, but their defensive options and escape paths differ based on which modification is applied. Weight distribution shifts to accommodate the leg changes - S-Mount loads weight onto the bent-knee side, Technical Mount maintains perpendicular pressure, High Mount drives chest pressure forward. Arms actively control opponent's defensive attempts, typically gripping wrists, controlling heads, or establishing submission grips. These modifications are transitional, flowing between full mount, modified versions, and submission attempts.

## Key Principles
- **Purpose-Driven Modification**: Each modification addresses specific defensive reactions or creates specific attacks
- **Smooth Transitions**: Flow between standard mount and modifications without losing control
- **Base Adaptation**: Adjust base and weight distribution to match the modified structure
- **Threat Maintenance**: Modifications should increase attacking options, not just be different positions
- **Read and React**: Choose modifications based on opponent's defensive strategy
- **Reversibility**: Ability to return to full mount if modification is unsuccessful

## Expert Insights
- **John Danaher**: "The modified mounts represent a critical understanding: positions must be fluid and adaptive. When the opponent turns to their side to escape standard mount, technical mount follows them. When they extend arms to frame, S-Mount isolates those arms for attacks. The key is recognizing that mount is not one position but a family of related positions, each optimized for specific scenarios. Master practitioners flow between these variations so smoothly that the opponent can never establish effective defense."

- **Gordon Ryan**: "I use modified mounts constantly because everyone knows how to defend standard mount now. S-Mount is my go-to for armbars - I'll bait them into framing, then transition to S-Mount and the arm is gift-wrapped. Technical mount I use when they turn away, immediately setting up the back take. High mount is for when they turtle up - drive the chest high and either finish chokes or take the back. Each modification has specific purposes in my attacking system."

- **Eddie Bravo**: "Modified mounts are where creativity meets control. In 10th Planet, we've developed some unique variations that people don't see coming. The key is not being married to one position - if standard mount isn't working, modify it. If that modification gets defended, modify it again. It's like having different tools in a toolbox. The opponent thinks they've solved mount, then you hit them with a variation they didn't prepare for."

## Common Errors

### Error: Transitioning to modified mount without clear purpose
- **Consequence**: Modification sacrifices some stability of full mount. If done randomly without tactical reason, you lose control without gaining attacking advantage. Opponent exploits the weakened structure to escape or improve position.
- **Correction**: Only modify mount in response to specific defensive actions or to set up specific submissions. S-Mount when they extend arms, Technical Mount when they turn away, High Mount when they turtle. Each modification should make their current defense invalid and create new threats.
- **Recognition**: If you're transitioning between modified mounts without attempts at submissions or clear reactions to opponent's defense, you're doing it wrong.

### Error: Poor base during modification transition
- **Consequence**: The moment of transitioning between mount variations is when you're most vulnerable. Poor base during transition allows opponent to explode into escapes, sweeps, or reversals. Control is lost during the very move meant to increase control.
- **Correction**: Maintain three points of contact during all transitions when possible. Keep weight heavy and distributed properly throughout the modification. Practice transitions slowly first to learn stable pathways. Don't rush modifications - smoothness prevents escape opportunities.
- **Recognition**: If opponent successfully escapes during your mount modifications, your base was compromised during transition.

### Error: Abandoning pressure and weight distribution
- **Consequence**: Modified mounts require adjusted weight distribution but still need heavy pressure. If you lift weight off opponent during modification, they gain space for frames, bridges, or hip escapes. Position becomes cosmetic without real control.
- **Correction**: Each modified mount has optimal weight distribution. S-Mount loads weight on bent-knee side, Technical Mount maintains perpendicular pressure, High Mount drives chest weight forward. Stay heavy and connected throughout all modifications.
- **Recognition**: If opponent feels light and mobile under your modified mount, you've lost pressure.

### Error: Failing to return to full mount when modification is defended
- **Consequence**: Stubbornly maintaining a defended modified mount position is worse than returning to standard mount. You end up in a weaker structure that's being countered, risking position loss entirely. Ego costs you control.
- **Correction**: Modified mounts are exploratory - if the specific attack they enable is defended, smoothly return to full mount and try different approach. Don't commit to failed modifications. Flow back to strongest position and reassess.
- **Recognition**: If you're stuck in a modified mount position for more than 10-15 seconds without progressing or attacking, you should have returned to full mount already.

### Error: Telegraphing which modified mount you'll use
- **Consequence**: If your transitions are predictable, opponent can prepare specific counters. They'll know S-Mount is coming when you reach for their arm, or Technical Mount when they turn slightly. Predictability allows them to time their defenses perfectly.
- **Correction**: Develop multiple pathways to each modification. Use feints and misdirection. Sometimes go to S-Mount on the opposite side they expect. Mix up your timing and entry methods. Keep opponent guessing which modification is coming.
- **Recognition**: If opponent is successfully defending your modified mount attempts repeatedly, you've become predictable.

## Training Drills

### Drill 1: Mount Modification Flow
Start in standard full mount. Partner on bottom performs various defensive actions (turning left, turning right, framing with arms, turtling). Top person responds with appropriate modified mount (Technical Mount for turns, S-Mount for frames, High Mount for turtling). Hold each modification for 5 seconds, then return to full mount. Repeat cycle. Begin at 25% resistance, build to 60%. 5-minute rounds. Focus: Reading defensive cues, smooth transitions, maintaining control throughout, appropriate modification selection.

### Drill 2: S-Mount Armbar Repetitions
Establish full mount. Partner extends arms to frame. Top person transitions to S-Mount position and threatens armbar. Partner defends armbar. Top person either finishes the armbar or returns to full mount based on defense. Repeat cycle with alternating sides. Progressive resistance (40%, 60%, 80%). 4-minute rounds. Focus: Clean S-Mount entries, maintaining balance on one knee, armbar mechanics, recognizing when to finish vs reset.

### Drill 3: Technical Mount to Back Take
Start in full mount. Bottom person turns to their side (away from you). Top person immediately transitions to Technical Mount, hooks their far arm, and works to establish back control. Partner provides realistic defensive resistance (70%). Complete the back take or return to mount. 5-minute rounds alternating. Focus: Recognizing the turn, fast Technical Mount establishment, using arm hook to climb to back, maintaining control if back take is defended.

### Drill 4: Modified Mount Chain Sparring
Positional sparring starting from full mount. Top person must cycle through at least three different modified mounts during each round while attempting submissions. Bottom person attempts to escape. If escape is successful, reset. If submission is nearly finished, reset in modified mount. Live resistance (80-90%). 5-minute rounds. Focus: For top - smooth transitions, appropriate modifications, maintaining dominance, submission setups. For bottom - defending different modifications, timing escapes during transitions.

### Drill 5: High Mount Pressure and Attacks
Establish full mount then transition to High Mount position. Maintain heavy chest pressure while setting up collar chokes, arm attacks, or back take opportunities. Partner attempts to create space and defend (70% resistance). 3-minute rounds. Focus: Proper weight distribution in High Mount, smothering pressure, transitioning to submissions without losing position, dealing with defensive frames, using position to tire opponent.

## Related Positions
- [[Mount]] - Standard full mount, parent position for all modifications
- [[S-Mount]] - Specific modified mount with one leg extended for armbars
- [[Technical Mount]] - Modified mount with one leg hooking opponent's arm for back take
- [[High Mount]] - Modified mount with elevated chest position for submissions
- [[Back Control]] - Target position from Technical Mount transitions
- [[Armbar Control]] - Submission position accessed from S-Mount

## Optimal Submission Paths

**Fastest path to submission** (S-Mount):
[[Modified Mount Top]] → [[S-Mount Establishment]] → [[Armbar from S-Mount]] → [[Won by Submission]]
*Reasoning: S-Mount creates immediate armbar threat when opponent frames. One of highest percentage attacks from mount family.*

**High-percentage path** (positional dominance):
[[Modified Mount Top]] → [[Technical Mount Transition]] → [[Back Take from Technical Mount]] → [[Back Control]] → [[Rear Naked Choke]] → [[Won by Submission]]
*Reasoning: Technical Mount to back is extremely high percentage, and back offers best submission rate. Most reliable path.*

**Alternative submission path** (High Mount):
[[Modified Mount Top]] → [[High Mount Transition]] → [[Cross Collar Choke from High Mount]] → [[Won by Submission]]
*Reasoning: High Mount creates strong collar choke opportunities in gi. Heavy pressure prevents defense.*

**Systematic path** (multiple modifications):
[[Modified Mount Top]] → [[S-Mount Attempt]] → [[Return to Full Mount]] → [[Technical Mount Transition]] → [[Back Control]] → [[Won by Submission]]
*Reasoning: Using modifications to create reactions, systematically advancing position until submission presents itself.*

## Decision Tree

**If** opponent extends arms to frame and push:
- Execute [[S-Mount Establishment]] → [[Armbar from S-Mount]] (Probability: 85%)
  - Reasoning: Extended arms are perfect armbar setup, S-Mount isolates them
- Or Execute [[Trap Arm]] → [[Americana from Mount]] (Probability: 70%)
  - Reasoning: Alternative arm attack when S-Mount is unavailable

**Else if** opponent turns to their side to escape:
- Execute [[Technical Mount Transition]] → [[Back Take]] (Probability: 88%)
  - Reasoning: Side turn exposes back, Technical Mount is gateway position
- Or Execute [[Maintain Modified Mount]] → [[Technical Mount]] (Probability: 80%)
  - Reasoning: If back is defended, Technical Mount still controls turned opponent

**Else if** opponent turtles up defensively:
- Execute [[High Mount Transition]] → [[Back Take]] (Probability: 82%)
  - Reasoning: Turtle from mount exposes back for taking
- Or Execute [[High Mount]] → [[Collar Chokes]] (Probability: 75%)
  - Reasoning: High mount with turtle allows strong choke setups

**Else if** opponent bridges explosively:
- Execute [[Return to Full Mount]] → [[Mount]] (Probability: 90%)
  - Reasoning: Bridge indicates they're fighting modified structure, return to strongest position
- Or Execute [[Ride the Bridge]] → [[Maintain Modified Mount]] (Probability: 70%)
  - Reasoning: Use bridge energy to resettle in modified position

**Else** (opponent defensive but static):
- Execute [[Cycle Modifications]] → [[Various Modified Mounts]] (Probability: 75%)
  - Reasoning: Use different modifications to create reactions and openings
- Or Execute [[Return to Full Mount]] → [[Mount]] (Probability: 85%)
  - Reasoning: Reset to strongest position if modifications aren't creating opportunities
