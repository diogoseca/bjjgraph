#bjj #state #leg-entanglement #top #intermediate

## State Properties
- **State ID**: S248
- **Point Value**: 2 (Advantage position)
- **Position Type**: Offensive
- **Risk Level**: Medium
- **Energy Cost**: Low
- **Time Sustainability**: Medium

## State Description
Inside Ashi Garami Top, also known as Standard Ashi Garami or Single Leg X, is a foundational leg entanglement position where the top player controls one of opponent's legs between their own legs while maintaining inside control with one leg across opponent's hip. This position serves as the entry point for many advanced leg attack systems and provides direct access to straight ankle locks, heel hooks (where legal), and kneebars. The position balances control with offensive capability, allowing the top player to threaten submissions while maintaining relatively safe positioning.

Inside Ashi Garami represents the standard position in modern leg lock systems, serving as the foundation from which more complex entanglements develop. The "inside" designation refers to the inside leg (closest to opponent's body) being placed across their hip rather than their far hip, which distinguishes it from outside ashi. This inside positioning provides better control over opponent's hip movement and creates direct pathways to more advanced positions like honey hole and saddle.

The position excels in no-gi grappling where leg attacks are permitted, offering a systematic approach to leg attacks that can be developed from beginner to advanced levels. White and blue belts typically work straight ankle locks from this position, while advanced practitioners layer in heel hooks and transition to more complex entanglements. The position's effectiveness stems from the mechanical control it provides over one leg while leaving hands free for grips and adjustments.

## Visual Description
You are positioned perpendicular to your opponent, with your body forming an "L" or "T" shape relative to theirs. Your inside leg (closest to their body) extends across their near hip, with your foot positioned past their far hip to control hip rotation. Your outside leg weaves around their trapped leg, with your foot hooking behind their knee or lower thigh to prevent leg extraction. Both of your legs work together to clamp their trapped leg between yours, creating a mechanical trap that isolates the leg from their body. Your hips are elevated slightly off the mat or positioned to the side, creating an angle that allows you to apply pressure to their trapped leg while maintaining balance. Your upper body is positioned away from their free leg, with your hands controlling their trapped ankle or establishing grips on their upper body to limit defensive options. Your head is positioned away from kicking range of their free leg, typically angled toward their trapped leg side. The entanglement creates a configuration where their trapped leg is isolated and controllable, while their free leg has limited defensive utility due to your body positioning and angle. Your inside leg across their hip serves as a barrier that prevents them from turning into you or squaring up, while your outside leg's hook behind their knee prevents them from pulling their leg out. This position allows you to control distance, prevent escapes, and progressively break down their leg defenses while threatening multiple submission attacks.

## Key Principles
- **Inside Leg Control**: Maintain inside leg across opponent's hip to prevent rotation and maintain inside position
- **Outside Leg Hook**: Keep outside leg hooked behind opponent's knee to prevent leg extraction
- **Hip Elevation**: Elevate hips to create pressure and improve submission leverage
- **Distance Management**: Control distance between bodies to facilitate attacks while preventing counters
- **Progressive Control**: Build from basic control to advanced entanglements systematically
- **Submission Hierarchy**: Understand and apply appropriate submissions based on rule set and skill level

## Expert Insights
- **John Danaher**: "Inside Ashi Garami is the foundational position of modern leg lock systems. Before you can master heel hooks or saddle positions, you must understand the mechanics of inside ashi. The position teaches fundamental concepts—inside control, hip pressure, leg isolation—that apply to all leg entanglements. Your primary focus should be on mastering the straight ankle lock from this position first, as it develops the mechanical understanding needed for more dangerous attacks. The inside leg across the hip is critical—it prevents opponent rotation and maintains your inside position, which is the key to leg lock dominance. Build control methodically, understand the transitions to more advanced positions, and never rush the submission."

- **Gordon Ryan**: "Inside ashi is my entry point for almost all leg attacks. I look for this position constantly—from guard passing, from failed takedowns, from opponent's guard pulls. Once I secure inside ashi, I immediately evaluate whether to stay and attack from here or transition to honey hole or saddle. The straight ankle lock from inside ashi is extremely high percentage, especially when opponent is focused on defending heel hooks. In competition, I use inside ashi as both a finishing position and a transitional position depending on opponent's reactions. The key is understanding when to stay and when to advance—this decision-making separates good leg lockers from great ones."

- **Eddie Bravo**: "While inside ashi isn't traditionally part of the 10th Planet system, I've incorporated it because it connects beautifully with our existing positions. From inside ashi, you can transition to positions we already use like the truck and leg attacks we've developed. The position fits our philosophy of control before submission—establish inside ashi, control their leg completely, then attack. I teach students to think of inside ashi as a gateway position—it's rarely where you finish, but it's often where you start. The position also works well in combination with upper body attacks, which is important in our system. If leg locks aren't available, you can transition to back attacks or other submissions using the control you've established."

## Common Errors
- **Error**: Loose leg control
  - **Consequence**: Allows opponent to extract leg and escape entanglement, losing attacking position.
  - **Correction**: Maintain tight leg control by keeping your legs clamped around opponent's trapped leg, using inside leg across hip and outside leg hooking behind their knee.
  - **Recognition**: If opponent's leg feels loose or they're making progress extracting it, your leg control needs tightening.

- **Error**: Poor body angle
  - **Consequence**: Reduces submission effectiveness and makes position easier to counter or escape.
  - **Correction**: Position body perpendicular to opponent with proper alignment—inside leg controls hip, outside leg controls knee, upper body angled for optimal leverage on trapped leg.
  - **Recognition**: If submissions feel weak or opponent easily defends, examine your body angle and alignment.

- **Error**: Neglecting upper body control
  - **Consequence**: Opponent can use hands to defend leg or create frames that neutralize attacks.
  - **Correction**: Control opponent's upper body with grips, frames, or positioning to limit their defensive capabilities while setting up leg attacks.
  - **Recognition**: If opponent successfully blocks submissions with hand fighting, you need better upper body control.

- **Error**: Rushing submission attempts
  - **Consequence**: Results in lost position as opponent escapes during premature attack, losing control before securing finish.
  - **Correction**: Build control progressively—establish entanglement, eliminate space, control hips, isolate leg, then apply submission slowly with full control.
  - **Recognition**: If opponent frequently escapes during your attacks, you're rushing the finish before securing position.

- **Error**: Ignoring opponent's free leg
  - **Consequence**: Allows opponent to use free leg for frames, escapes, or even counter-attacks.
  - **Correction**: Monitor and control opponent's free leg positioning with your body angle and leg placement to prevent them from using it effectively in defense.
  - **Recognition**: If opponent's free leg interferes with your attacks or creates escape opportunities, you're not managing it properly.

- **Error**: Staying in static position
  - **Consequence**: Allows opponent to develop escape momentum and eventually break free or counter.
  - **Correction**: Make continuous micro-adjustments based on opponent's movements—tighten entanglement when they push, transition to better positions when they defend, adjust grips based on their reactions.
  - **Recognition**: If opponent progressively improves their position despite your control, you're being too static.

- **Error**: Wrong submission selection for rule set
  - **Consequence**: Illegal attacks result in disqualification or missed opportunities by not using available submissions.
  - **Correction**: Understand legal submissions for your rule set and belt level—straight ankle locks are legal everywhere, heel hooks have specific restrictions, always verify competition rules.
  - **Recognition**: Know the rules before competing and practice submissions appropriate for your level and rule set.

## Training Drills
- **Entry to Control Drill**: From various positions (standing, seated guard, failed guard pass), practice entering inside ashi with proper leg configuration and body angle. Partner provides 25% resistance initially, increasing to 75% as technique improves. 15 repetitions focusing on smooth entry and immediate control establishment. This builds entry timing and recognition.

- **Position Retention Drill**: Partner establishes inside ashi on you, and you attempt escapes using 50% resistance. Partner maintains position through micro-adjustments and control refinements. 5-minute rounds building position retention endurance and defensive awareness. Switch roles to understand both perspectives. This develops the ability to hold position under pressure.

- **Submission Progression Flow**: From established inside ashi, practice transitioning between straight ankle lock, toe hold, and kneebar without releasing position. Focus on smooth transitions and understanding which submission is available based on opponent's leg positioning. 3-minute rounds emphasizing control maintenance during submission changes. This builds submission awareness and flow.

- **Position Advancement Drill**: From inside ashi, practice transitioning to honey hole and saddle positions based on opponent's reactions. Partner provides realistic defensive responses. 10 transitions to each advanced position, focusing on maintaining control during transition. This develops ability to recognize and execute position improvements.

- **Live Positional Sparring**: Start in inside ashi position and roll with progressive resistance—first 5 minutes at 50% (focus on control and technique), next 5 minutes at 75% (build timing), final 5 minutes at 100% (test under competition pressure). Top player works for submissions and position advancement, bottom player works for escapes and reversals. Reset to inside ashi after each success or escape. Track success rates and time to submission to measure improvement.
