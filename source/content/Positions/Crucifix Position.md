## State Properties
- **State ID**: S028
- **Point Value**: 3 (Strong control with submission opportunities)
- **Position Type**: Control/submission position
- **Risk Level**: Low
- **Energy Cost**: Low
- **Time Sustainability**: Medium to Long

## State Description
The Crucifix is a specialized control position where one practitioner controls their opponent by isolating one of their arms while simultaneously controlling their head/neck area. The position typically involves the controlling practitioner perpendicular to their opponent, with the opponent's isolated arm trapped between the controlling practitioner's legs while their head is controlled through various grips or hooks. The Crucifix offers exceptional control with minimal energy expenditure while creating numerous submission opportunities, particularly chokes and armlocks, making it one of the most efficient control positions in BJJ.

## Key Principles
- Isolate and control one of opponent's arms with legs
- Establish head/neck control with arms or legs
- Maintain perpendicular body positioning
- Create and exploit submission angles
- Prevent opponent from turning into you
- Maintain control through proper weight distribution
- Apply systematic pressure to expose submission opportunities

## Prerequisites
- Understanding of arm isolation mechanics
- Familiarity with perpendicular control positions
- Recognition of entry opportunities
- Knowledge of submission options from position

## State Invariants
- One of opponent's arms isolated and controlled between legs
- Control of opponent's head/neck region
- Perpendicular body alignment
- Opponent typically prone or on side
- Limited mobility for opponent

## Defensive Responses (When Opponent Has This State)
- [[Bridge and Roll]] → [[Guard Recovery]]
- [[Arm Extraction]] → [[Turtle Position]]
- [[Hip Escape]] → [[Side Control Escape]]
- [[Duck Under]] → [[Neutral Position]]
- [[Forward Roll]] → [[Scramble Position]]

## Offensive Transitions (Available From This State)
- [[Crucifix Rear Naked Choke]] → [[Won by Submission]]
- [[Crucifix Straight Armlock]] → [[Won by Submission]]
- [[Reverse Triangle from Crucifix]] → [[Triangle Control]]
- [[Crucifix to Back Control]] → [[Back Control]]
- [[Wrist Lock from Crucifix]] → [[Won by Submission]]
- [[Rolling Crucifix]] → [[Arm Triangle]]
- [[Crucifix Neck Crank]] → [[Won by Submission]]
- [[Transition to North-South]] → [[North-South]]

## Counter Transitions
- [[Re-establish Crucifix]] → [[Crucifix Position]] (against escape attempts)
- [[Switch to Back Control]] → [[Back Control]] (if position is compromised)
- [[Transition to Turtle Top]] → [[Turtle Top]] (if opponent turns)

## Expert Insights
- **Danaher System**: Views the crucifix as an exceptionally efficient control position that provides both positional dominance and high-percentage submission opportunities with minimal energy expenditure. Emphasizes the mechanical principles of arm isolation and head control, focusing on systematic progression through submission attempts based on the opponent's defensive reactions.
- **Gordon Ryan**: Utilizes the crucifix extensively in competition, emphasizing proper weight distribution and connection points to maintain control while methodically working toward submissions. Particularly focuses on creating pressure that forces predictable defensive movements that expose submission opportunities.
- **Eddie Bravo**: Has developed specialized crucifix variations within the 10th Planet system that connect to his twister and truck control positions. Emphasizes unique submission combinations not commonly seen in traditional BJJ, particularly neck cranks and innovative choke variations.

## Common Errors
- Poor leg positioning → Arm extraction opportunities
- Insufficient head control → Defensive mobility
- Body misalignment → Reduced control efficiency
- Premature submission attempts → Position compromise
- Overcommitment to single submission → Predictability

## Training Drills
- Crucifix maintenance against increasing resistance
- Transition flows between crucifix and related positions
- Progressive submission sequences
- Control and pressure sensitivity exercises
- Entry practice from multiple positions

## Related States
- [[Back Control]] - Similar control with different mechanics
- [[Turtle Top]] - Common entry position to crucifix
- [[North-South]] - Related perpendicular control position
- [[Triangle Control]] - Related submission control
- [[Arm Triangle]] - Potential transitional submission

## Decision Tree
If opponent defends neck exposure:
- Execute [[Crucifix Straight Armlock]] or [[Wrist Lock from Crucifix]]

Else if opponent attempts to turn into you:
- Execute [[Reverse Triangle from Crucifix]] or [[Rolling Crucifix]]

Else if opponent exposes neck:
- Execute [[Crucifix Rear Naked Choke]] or [[Crucifix Neck Crank]]

Else if control becomes compromised:
- Execute [[Crucifix to Back Control]] or [[Transition to North-South]]

## Position Metrics
- Success Rate: 80% control retention (competition data)
- Average Time in Position: 30-90 seconds
- Submission Probability: 65%
- Control Maintenance Probability: 85%
- Position Loss Probability: 10%

## Optimal Paths
Primary submission path:
[[Crucifix Position]] → [[Crucifix Rear Naked Choke]] → [[Won by Submission]]

Secondary submission path:
[[Crucifix Position]] → [[Crucifix Straight Armlock]] → [[Won by Submission]]

Transitional path:
[[Crucifix Position]] → [[Crucifix to Back Control]] → [[Back Control]] → [[Rear Naked Choke]] → [[Won by Submission]]

## Computer Science Analogy
The Crucifix Position represents a highly optimized control node in the BJJ state graph with exceptional constraints on opponent movement. It functions as a "resource locking" mechanism similar to process isolation in operating systems, where both arm and head resources are simultaneously locked, severely restricting the opponent's degrees of freedom. This creates a favorable computational scenario where the controlling player's action space remains large while the opponent's is minimized, representing a near-optimal state in the positional hierarchy.
