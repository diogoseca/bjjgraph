# Crucifix Position
#bjj #state #control #submission #crucifix

## State Properties
- **State ID**: S028
- **Point Value**: 3 (Strong control with submission opportunities)
- **Position Type**: Control/submission position
- **Risk Level**: Low
- **Energy Cost**: Low
- **Time Sustainability**: Medium to Long

## State Description
The Crucifix is a specialized control position where one practitioner controls their opponent by isolating one of their arms while simultaneously controlling their head/neck area. The position typically involves the controlling practitioner perpendicular to their opponent, with the opponent's isolated arm trapped between the controlling practitioner's legs while their head is controlled through various grips or hooks. The Crucifix offers exceptional control with minimal energy expenditure while creating numerous submission opportunities, particularly chokes and armlocks, making it one of the most efficient control positions in BJJ.

### Visual Description
You are positioned perpendicular to your opponent, forming a cross-like alignment with their body, where their isolated arm is trapped securely between your legs—one leg often hooks over their shoulder or upper arm while the other presses against their torso or traps the arm at the elbow, effectively pinning it. Your upper body controls their head or neck, often with an arm wrapping around their neck in a seatbelt grip or similar hold, pulling their face towards your chest to limit their vision and mobility. Your weight is strategically placed, often sitting on or near their shoulder or upper back, keeping them flattened or on their side, unable to turn into you or escape easily. This setup severely restricts the opponent, who is typically prone or on their side on the mat, with one arm completely immobilized and their head controlled, leaving them vulnerable to chokes or armlocks as you maintain a dominant angle for attack while expending minimal energy to hold the position.

## Key Principles
- Isolate and control one of opponent's arms with legs
- Establish head/neck control with arms or legs
- Maintain perpendicular body positioning
- Create and exploit submission angles
- Prevent opponent from turning into you
- Maintain control through proper weight distribution
- Apply systematic pressure to expose submission opportunities

## Prerequisites
- Understanding of arm isolation mechanics
- Familiarity with perpendicular control positions
- Recognition of entry opportunities
- Knowledge of submission options from position

## State Invariants
- One of opponent's arms isolated and controlled between legs
- Control of opponent's head/neck region
- Perpendicular body alignment
- Opponent typically prone or on side
- Limited mobility for opponent

## Counter Transitions
- [[Re-establish Crucifix]] → [[Crucifix Position]] (against escape attempts)
- [[Switch to Back Control]] → [[Back Control]] (if position is compromised)
- [[Transition to Turtle Top]] → [[Turtle Top]] (if opponent turns)

## Expert Insights
- **Danaher System**: Views the crucifix as an exceptionally efficient control position that provides both positional dominance and high-percentage submission opportunities with minimal energy expenditure. Emphasizes the mechanical principles of arm isolation and head control, focusing on systematic progression through submission attempts based on the opponent's defensive reactions.
- **Gordon Ryan**: Utilizes the crucifix extensively in competition, emphasizing proper weight distribution and connection points to maintain control while methodically working toward submissions. Particularly focuses on creating pressure that forces predictable defensive movements that expose submission opportunities.
- **Eddie Bravo**: Has developed specialized crucifix variations within the 10th Planet system that connect to his twister and truck control positions. Emphasizes unique submission combinations not commonly seen in traditional BJJ, particularly neck cranks and innovative choke variations.

## Common Errors
- **Error**: Poor leg positioning
  - **Consequence**: Leads to arm extraction opportunities, as improper leg placement allows the opponent to free their trapped arm.
  - **Correction**: Ensure your legs are securely trapping their arm, with one leg over the shoulder or upper arm and the other pressing against their torso or elbow.
- **Error**: Insufficient head control
  - **Consequence**: Results in increased defensive mobility for the opponent, enabling them to turn their head or body to initiate escapes.
  - **Correction**: Maintain a tight grip or hook around their neck or head, pulling it towards your chest to limit their vision and movement.
- **Error**: Body misalignment
  - **Consequence**: Causes reduced control efficiency, as not being perpendicular weakens your leverage and pressure on the opponent.
  - **Correction**: Keep your body aligned perpendicular to theirs, ensuring your weight is placed effectively on their shoulder or upper back.
- **Error**: Premature submission attempts
  - **Consequence**: Leads to position compromise, as rushing a submission can create openings for the opponent to escape or counter.
  - **Correction**: Secure control first, ensuring all connection points are tight before transitioning to a submission attempt.
- **Error**: Overcommitment to single submission
  - **Consequence**: Creates predictability, allowing the opponent to anticipate and defend against your primary attack.
  - **Correction**: Vary your submission attempts, using feints or chaining multiple attacks to keep the opponent guessing.

## Training Drills
- **Crucifix Maintenance**: Practice maintaining Crucifix against increasing resistance, focusing on arm isolation and head control.
- **Transition Flows**: Drill transition flows between Crucifix and related positions like Back Control or North-South, ensuring smooth movement.
- **Progressive Submission Sequences**: Work on progressive submission sequences, chaining attacks like chokes and armlocks from Crucifix.
- **Control and Pressure Sensitivity**: Engage in control and pressure sensitivity exercises, learning to adjust weight and grips based on opponent reactions.
- **Entry Practice**: Practice entry into Crucifix from multiple positions, such as Turtle Top or during scrambles, to build dynamic application.

## Computer Science Analogy
The Crucifix Position represents a highly optimized control node in the BJJ state graph with exceptional constraints on opponent movement. It functions as a "resource locking" mechanism similar to process isolation in operating systems, where both arm and head resources are simultaneously locked, severely restricting the opponent's degrees of freedom. This creates a favorable computational scenario where the controlling player's action space remains large while the opponent's is minimized, representing a near-optimal state in the positional hierarchy.
