# Scarf Hold Top
#bjj #position #pin #kesa-gatame #top

## State Description

Scarf Hold Top (Kesa Gatame) is a traditional judo pinning position worth 3 points in IBJJF rules, where you sit perpendicular to your opponent's torso with your hip against their ribs, controlling their near arm across your body while applying cross face pressure. This position offers strong control through hip pressure and arm isolation, creating both submission opportunities and pathways to more dominant positions like mount.

The position is characterized by sitting at approximately a 90-degree angle to your opponent's body, with your bodyweight distributed through your hip into their ribcage. The near arm is trapped and controlled, while your arm wraps around their head creating cross face pressure. This configuration prevents most common escapes while setting up powerful submission attacks, particularly the americana shoulder lock.

Scarf hold offers excellent control with lower energy expenditure, making it sustainable for extended periods. However, it carries slightly more risk than standard side control due to potential back exposure if the opponent successfully turns away. The position excels against opponents unfamiliar with its specific escapes and provides strong submission opportunities through the isolated near arm.

## Visual Description

You are sitting perpendicular to your opponent's torso, positioned at roughly a 90-degree angle with your right hip pressed firmly into their right ribcage. Your left arm wraps around their head, with your hand gripping their far shoulder or gi fabric, creating cross face pressure that turns their face away from you. Their right arm is trapped across your chest and torso, controlled by your right hand gripping their wrist or sleeve. Your right leg is extended for base while your left leg is bent with the knee near their head. Your opponent lies on their back or partially turned, unable to create effective frames due to their trapped arm. Your weight is distributed primarily through your hip into their ribs, creating constant pressure that restricts breathing and movement.

This creates a controlling platform where your hip pressure and arm control prevent most escapes while positioning their trapped arm perfectly for submissions. The perpendicular angle gives you leverage advantages for maintaining control and transitioning to other positions when needed.

## Key Principles

- **Hip Pressure**: Heavy, constant weight through your hip into opponent's ribs restricts breathing and movement
- **Arm Isolation**: Controlling near arm eliminates primary defensive tool and creates submission opportunities
- **Cross Face Control**: Prevents opponent from turning into you, which is primary escape direction
- **Base Management**: Extended back leg and bent front leg provide stability against bridges and turns
- **Weight Distribution**: Sit on hip, not on your butt, to maximize pressure and mobility
- **Head Position**: Keep your head low and away from opponent to prevent them grabbing it
- **Escape Awareness**: Be ready for bridge-and-turn or back-door escapes and counter immediately

## Offensive Transitions

From this position, you can execute:

### Submissions
- [[Americana from Scarf Hold]] → [[Americana Control]] (Success Rate: Beginner 25%, Intermediate 40%, Advanced 55%)
  - Isolate trapped arm, grip wrist and elbow, lift elbow while pinning wrist for shoulder lock

- [[Arm Triangle from Scarf Hold]] → [[Arm Triangle Control]] (Success Rate: Beginner 20%, Intermediate 35%, Advanced 50%)
  - Use opponent's trapped arm against their own neck, wrap arm around head, squeeze for blood choke

- [[Straight Armbar from Scarf Hold]] → [[Armbar Control]] (Success Rate: Beginner 15%, Intermediate 30%, Advanced 45%)
  - Extend trapped arm, rotate body to break angle, apply armbar mechanics

### Position Improvements
- [[Transition to Mount]] → [[Mount]] (Success Rate: Beginner 40%, Intermediate 55%, Advanced 70%)
  - Step over body to mount when opponent defends submissions or attempts escape

- [[Transition to North-South]] → [[North-South]] (Success Rate: Beginner 50%, Intermediate 65%, Advanced 80%)
  - Walk around head to north-south for different attacking angle and more secure control

- [[Take the Back]] → [[Back Control]] (Success Rate: Beginner 30%, Intermediate 45%, Advanced 60%)
  - If opponent turns away, follow their movement to establish back control

## Defensive Responses

When opponent has this position against you, available counters:

- [[Bridge and Turn Escape]] → [[Guard Recovery]] (Success Rate: 35%)
  - Bridge explosively and turn into opponent, trying to recover guard or create scramble

- [[Back Door Escape]] → [[Turtle Position]] (Success Rate: 40%)
  - Turn away from opponent, come to your knees, establish turtle position

- [[Push Face and Create Space]] → [[Side Control Escape]] (Success Rate: 25%)
  - Frame on opponent's face, create space, attempt to slip out or recover guard

- [[Arm Extraction]] → [[Scarf Hold Defense]] (Success Rate: 30%)
  - Pull trapped arm out using bridging and hip movement, prevent submissions

## Decision Tree

**If** opponent frames on face and attempts to turn in:
- Execute [[Maintain Cross Face Pressure]] → [[Scarf Hold Top]] (Probability: 65%)
  - Reasoning: Heavy cross face prevents turn completion
- Or Execute [[Transition to Mount]] → [[Mount]] (Probability: 55%)
  - Reasoning: Use their turn momentum to establish mount

**Else if** opponent turns away attempting back door escape:
- Execute [[Hook Near Leg and Flatten]] → [[Scarf Hold Top]] (Probability: 60%)
  - Reasoning: Leg hook prevents escape to turtle
- Or Execute [[Take the Back]] → [[Back Control]] (Probability: 50%)
  - Reasoning: Follow their turn to back control

**Else if** opponent is flat and defensive:
- Execute [[Attack Americana]] → [[Submission Control]] (Probability: 40%)
  - Reasoning: Static position allows submission setup
- Or Execute [[Transition to North-South]] → [[North-South]] (Probability: 65%)
  - Reasoning: Move to different angle for new attacks

**Else** (opponent bridging or creating movement):
- Resettle weight and pressure → [[Scarf Hold Top]] (Probability: 70%)
  - Reasoning: Ride out movement then reestablish heavy control

## Expert Insights

**John Danaher**: "Scarf hold demonstrates the principle that perpendicular pressure can be just as effective as parallel pressure. The key is the hip placement - sitting on your hip, not your butt, creates the crushing weight that makes this position so difficult to escape. The trapped arm is a gift - it's already isolated and controlled, setting up the americana naturally. However, one must be aware of the back exposure vulnerability. If the opponent turns away successfully, you must immediately transition to back control or abandon the position. The position's effectiveness comes from understanding it's primarily a control position with submission opportunities, not the reverse."

**Gordon Ryan**: "In competition, I use scarf hold opportunistically rather than as a primary control position. It's excellent after certain takedowns or when transitioning between positions. The americana is high-percentage if you're patient with the setup. The key is not to force it - wait for the arm to give you a small opening, then capitalize immediately. One advantage is that many modern BJJ practitioners are less familiar with scarf hold escapes since side control is taught more commonly, so they waste energy on ineffective escape attempts. I'll often use it to tire opponents before transitioning to mount or back for higher-percentage submissions."

**Eddie Bravo**: "Scarf hold is old school but effective. In no-gi, you lose some of the gi control options but the fundamentals remain the same - hip pressure and arm control. I teach it as part of the top game progression, particularly focusing on the transition options. If they defend well, you've got mount and back available. If they defend poorly, you've got the arm. The position teaches important principles about weight distribution and perpendicular pressure that apply throughout your top game. Don't sleep on the traditional positions - they became traditional because they work."

## Common Errors

### Error: Sitting Too High on Opponent's Chest
- **Consequence**: Reduces pressure effectiveness, makes bridging escapes easier, allows opponent to turn more easily. High position lacks the crushing hip pressure that makes scarf hold effective.
- **Correction**: Sit lower with hip against ribs, not chest. Your hip should be in the pit of their ribcage. This maximizes pressure and stability.
- **Recognition**: If opponent can bridge you easily or breathe comfortably, you're sitting too high.

### Error: Releasing Near Arm Control
- **Consequence**: Opponent immediately creates frames and escapes. Near arm control is the foundation of the position - lose it and you lose everything.
- **Correction**: Maintain constant grip on trapped arm with at least one hand. Never release completely unless transitioning.
- **Recognition**: If opponent is pushing your face or creating space, their arm isn't truly controlled.

### Error: Weight Too Far Back on Your Butt
- **Consequence**: Reduces pressure, makes position easier to escape, less mobile for transitions. Sitting on butt instead of hip removes the crucial pressure element.
- **Correction**: Roll forward onto your hip bone, not your sitting bones. Think "hip into ribs" not "butt on mat."
- **Recognition**: If you feel stable but opponent isn't struggling, weight distribution is likely wrong.

### Error: Head Too High or Forward
- **Consequence**: Opponent can grab your head for leverage in escapes or sweeps. High head position is vulnerable.
- **Correction**: Keep head low, tucked close to opponent's head, away from their free arm.
- **Recognition**: If opponent is reaching for your head, it's too accessible.

### Error: Forgetting to Control Cross Face
- **Consequence**: Opponent turns into you easily, escapes to guard or creates scramble. Cross face pressure is key escape prevention.
- **Correction**: Maintain constant cross face pressure with arm around head, hand on far shoulder or gi.
- **Recognition**: If opponent is looking at you and turning toward you, cross face is insufficient.

### Error: Being Too Static
- **Consequence**: Opponent finds escape timing, you miss submission opportunities. Good control requires constant micro-adjustments.
- **Correction**: Actively adjust pressure, respond to their movements, transition when opportunities arise.
- **Recognition**: If opponent is making progress on escapes, you're being too passive.

### Error: Forcing Americana Too Early
- **Consequence**: Arm isn't sufficiently isolated, attempt fails, position weakens. Rushing submissions often loses control.
- **Correction**: Perfect the pin first, ensure arm is truly trapped, then attack submission when timing is right.
- **Recognition**: If americana attempt fails and opponent nearly escapes, it was premature.

## Training Drills

### Drill 1: Hip Pressure Development
Partner lies flat while you practice establishing and maintaining scarf hold with maximum hip pressure. Partner provides no resistance (0%) initially, then gives feedback on pressure level. Progress to partner attempting small movements (25% resistance) while you maintain crushing pressure. Focus on weight distribution through hip, not butt. Partner should feel significant breathing restriction (while remaining safe). Practice for 2-minute rounds, 5 rounds total. Common mistake: sitting on butt instead of hip. Success metric: partner reports strong pressure and restricted breathing.

### Drill 2: Escape Prevention Sequences
Partner attempts specific escapes (bridge and turn, back door escape) at 50% speed and power. Your goal is to recognize escape attempt immediately and counter appropriately. Bridge and turn: apply cross face and base. Back door escape: hook leg and flatten. Progress resistance from 50% to 75% as proficiency improves. 10 repetitions of each escape type per round. Focus on timing recognition and immediate response. Common error: waiting too long to counter. Success: shut down escapes before they develop.

### Drill 3: Submission Attack Flow
Establish scarf hold with cooperative partner (25% resistance). Practice flowing between americana setup, arm triangle setup, and position transitions (mount, north-south). Focus on maintaining control throughout transitions, not forcing submissions. Each flow should last 30-60 seconds before partner gives escape window. 8 rounds of flow. Goal is to develop comfort with all offensive options from position. Common mistake: losing control during transitions. Success metric: smooth flow between attacks without position loss.

### Drill 4: Live Positional Sparring
Start in established scarf hold. Top person maintains and attacks (submissions and transitions). Bottom person attempts escapes. Reset when: submission occurs, bottom escapes, or top transitions to mount/back. 3-minute rounds, alternate positions. Progress from 50% intensity to 90% intensity as both partners develop proficiency. Record successful escapes, submissions, and transitions. Goal: develop realistic application timing and pressure management.

## Related Positions

- [[Side Control Top]] - Similar pinning mechanics from parallel rather than perpendicular angle, often entry point to scarf hold
- [[Kuzure Kesa Gatame]] - Modified scarf hold variation with arm underhook instead of arm trap, similar but different control points
- [[Mount]] - Natural progression from scarf hold for more dominant position and points
- [[North-South]] - Alternative pinning position reached by walking around head from scarf hold
- [[Back Control]] - Available if opponent turns away attempting back door escape from scarf hold

## Optimal Submission Paths

**Fastest path to submission** (direct attack):
[[Scarf Hold Top]] → [[Americana from Scarf Hold]] → [[Won by Submission]]
*Reasoning: Arm is already trapped and isolated, americana is natural extension of control mechanics. Highest percentage submission from this position.*

**High-percentage path** (systematic control):
[[Scarf Hold Top]] → [[Perfect Hip Pressure]] → [[Arm Isolation]] → [[Americana from Scarf Hold]] → [[Won by Submission]]
*Reasoning: Establishing perfect pressure first makes submission inevitable. Taking time to perfect control before attacking increases success dramatically.*

**Alternative submission path** (if americana defended):
[[Scarf Hold Top]] → [[Americana Attempt]] → [[Opponent Defends]] → [[Arm Triangle from Scarf Hold]] → [[Won by Submission]]
*Reasoning: Americana defense often creates arm triangle opportunity. Arm stays bent and tight to neck, perfect for blood choke.*

**Positional dominance path** (point maximization):
[[Scarf Hold Top]] → [[Maintain Control]] → [[Transition to Mount]] → [[Mount Attacks]] → [[Won by Submission]]
*Reasoning: Mount scores more points (4 vs 3) and offers more submission options. Use scarf hold to tire opponent, then upgrade position.*

## Timing Considerations

**Best Times to Enter**:
- Immediately after successful throw or takedown that lands in scarf hold configuration
- When opponent turns into you from side control creating perpendicular angle
- As transition from mount when opponent turns to escape

**Best Times to Attack**:
- When opponent is flat and defensive, not actively escaping
- After successfully defending bridge attempt - opponent is tired and flat
- When trapped arm loosens or moves slightly - attack americana immediately

**Vulnerable Moments**:
- Initial establishment - brief window where opponent can prevent full control
- When transitioning to submissions - moment of position weakening
- If opponent bridges explosively - momentary instability requires countering

**Fatigue Factors**:
- Position is very low energy cost for top player - sustainable indefinitely
- Bottom player tires quickly from constant pressure and breathing restriction
- Longer you maintain position, easier submissions and transitions become

## Competition Considerations

**Point Scoring**: Scarf hold scores 3 points in IBJJF as a side control variant (pass to control for 3 seconds). In judo, it's a recognized pinning hold (kesa gatame) that can win by ippon if held for 20 seconds. Mount transition adds 4 more points.

**Time Management**: Excellent position for controlling match pace. Low energy cost means you can maintain it for entire rounds if needed. Use this to tire aggressive opponents before attacking.

**Rule Set Adaptations**: In gi, more grip options for control and cross face. In no-gi, rely more on arm trapping and body weight. In submission-only, focus on americana and arm triangle finishes rather than positional transitions.

**Competition Strategy**: Use after successful takedowns to secure position and points. Good defensive position for protecting leads. Transition to mount if you need more points or back if you need submissions.
