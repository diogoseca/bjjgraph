## State Description

Worm Guard Bottom is an innovative lapel-based guard system developed by Keenan Cornelius that uses the opponent's gi lapel woven through their own legs to create unique control and attack opportunities. The position combines lapel control with precise leg placement to create a control system that is extremely difficult to pass when executed correctly, while offering powerful sweeps and back take opportunities.

The guard is established by extracting the opponent's lapel (typically the same-side lapel), feeding it under their leg, and wrapping it around your own shin or foot to create a tight connection. This lapel weave creates a mechanical control that restricts the opponent's movement and posture in ways that traditional guard systems cannot replicate. The position is heavily dependent on gi grips and cannot be applied in no-gi contexts.

Worm guard excels against opponents who are unfamiliar with the system, as the control mechanisms and attack patterns are highly unusual compared to traditional guards. The position requires significant technical knowledge and practice to execute effectively, but rewards dedicated study with a guard system that can shut down even expert passers. The learning curve is steep, but the payoff is substantial for gi-based competitors.

## Visual Description

You are on your back with your opponent's lapel extracted and woven through the space under their own leg, then wrapped around your shin or foot on the same side, creating a tight connection between their gi and your leg. Your wrapped leg typically hooks behind their thigh or knee, using the lapel tension to control their leg's position and prevent them from backing out or circling away. Your free leg extends to manage distance, often with a foot on their hip, knee, or bicep to prevent them from collapsing forward pressure onto you. Your hands maintain strategic grips—one controlling their sleeve on the opposite side to break their posture and prevent defensive grips, the other may hold their pants, belt, or additional lapel material to enhance control. Your hips remain active despite the seemingly static lapel connection, constantly adjusting angles to off-balance your opponent and create sweep opportunities. The worm guard creates an unusual trapped feeling for your opponent, as their own gi and leg are working against them, limiting their passing options to unconventional paths that you can predict and counter.

## Key Principles

- **Lapel Weave Integrity**: Maintain constant tension on the lapel wrapped through opponent's leg and around your shin to preserve primary control mechanism
- **Leg Pin Control**: Use lapel-wrapped leg to pin opponent's leg in place, preventing backward escape or leg extraction which would break the guard
- **Opposite Side Disruption**: Control opponent's opposite sleeve to break symmetry and posture, making it impossible for them to establish stable passing pressure
- **Distance Management with Free Leg**: Actively use free leg to manage optimal distance, preventing close-range smash while maintaining attack ranges
- **Hip Angle Adjustment**: Constantly adjust hip angles despite lapel connection to create off-balancing forces that set up sweeps
- **Predictive Counter Strategy**: Understand that worm guard forces opponent into limited passing options which you can anticipate and counter systematically
- **Grip Endurance Focus**: Worm guard requires sustained grip strength on lapel and sleeve; develop grip endurance for extended exchanges

## Decision Tree

**If** opponent is unfamiliar with worm guard (showing confusion):
- Execute [[Worm Guard Sweep]] → [[Mount]] or [[Side Control Top]] (Probability: 60%)
  - Reasoning: Unfamiliarity with position leads to poor defensive posture, making sweep high-percentage
- Or Execute [[Worm to Back Take]] → [[Back Control]] (Probability: 55%)
  - Reasoning: Confused opponents often expose back when trying to clear unfamiliar control

**Else if** opponent attempts to back out or disengage:
- Execute [[Worm Guard Sweep]] → [[Mount]] or [[Side Control Top]] (Probability: 50%)
  - Reasoning: Backward movement plays directly into sweep mechanics
- Or Transition to [[Squid Guard Entry]] → [[Squid Guard Position]] (Probability: 45%)
  - Reasoning: As they back out, advance lapel control to more dominant squid position

**Else if** opponent drives forward with pressure:
- Execute [[Triangle from Worm]] → [[Triangle Control]] (Probability: 35%)
  - Reasoning: Forward pressure breaks their posture, creating triangle entry
- Or Execute [[Inverted Worm Back Take]] → [[Back Control]] (Probability: 40%)
  - Reasoning: Use their forward momentum to invert under and access back

**Else if** opponent attempts to clear lapel or free trapped leg:
- Execute [[Technical Stand-Up from Worm]] → [[Standing Position]] (Probability: 50%)
  - Reasoning: Their focus on clearing lapel allows you to stand while maintaining connection
- Or Transition to [[De La Riva Guard]] → [[De La Riva Recovery]] (Probability: 45%)
  - Reasoning: If lapel is being cleared effectively, transition to non-lapel guard system

**Else** (opponent establishes defensive control):
- Continue pressure with [[Worm Guard Sweep]] → [[Mount]] or [[Side Control Top]] (Probability: 40%)
  - Reasoning: Methodically work sweep mechanics even against prepared defense
- Or Advance to [[Ringworm Position]] → [[Ringworm Guard]] (Probability: 35%)
  - Reasoning: Enhance control by adding second leg to lapel weave system

## Expert Insights

**John Danaher**: "The worm guard represents an evolution in guard technology that exploits the gi in ways that traditional systems do not. Keenan Cornelius's innovation here is creating a control system where the opponent's own equipment becomes their constraint. The mechanical principle is elegant: by threading the lapel through their leg, you create a closed loop system where their movement options are severely restricted. The key is understanding that worm guard is not about strength or athleticism—it's about precise technical execution of a control system. Treat it as a systematic approach to guard retention and attacking."

**Gordon Ryan**: "I don't personally use worm guard because I compete no-gi primarily, but I've trained with Keenan and I respect the system deeply. When executed correctly, it's incredibly frustrating to pass even when you know what's coming. The guard works because it forces the passer into very specific responses, which you can anticipate and counter. If I were competing gi more, I would invest time in worm guard because it gives such a huge advantage against opponents who haven't specifically trained the counters. It's a high-investment, high-return guard system."

**Eddie Bravo**: "Worm guard is fascinating because it's such a recent innovation that shows BJJ is still evolving rapidly. Keenan took the lapel concept and created an entirely new guard system that didn't exist before. That's the spirit of innovation I love. While I focus more on no-gi systems, the principles of worm guard—using your opponent's equipment against them, creating unusual control mechanics—these are universal. In 10th Planet, we think about similar concepts with lockdown and rubber guard, where we're creating control systems that feel foreign and uncomfortable to the opponent."

## Common Errors

### Error: Losing lapel tension during setup or maintenance
- **Consequence**: Entire worm guard structure collapses if lapel loses tension, allowing opponent to extract leg and escape control system. Without tight lapel connection, position becomes ineffective standard open guard.
- **Correction**: Maintain constant pulling pressure on lapel throughout position. Monitor lapel wrap around shin/foot to ensure it stays tight. If tension loosens, immediately adjust or transition to different position.
- **Recognition**: If opponent can move their trapped leg freely or back away despite your attempts to control, lapel tension is insufficient. Should feel locked connection throughout.

### Error: Poor initial lapel feed through opponent's leg
- **Consequence**: Incorrect lapel weave angle or depth makes control weak and easy to clear. Improper feed can also create false sense of security that collapses under pressure.
- **Correction**: Practice deliberate lapel feeding—pull ample lapel material, feed deep under their leg (not shallow), wrap tightly around your shin/foot with proper tension. Seek coaching on exact mechanics of lapel weave.
- **Recognition**: If opponent easily clears "worm guard" with minimal effort, your initial setup was likely flawed. Proper worm guard should be difficult to clear even for experienced opponents.

### Error: Neglecting opposite-side sleeve or posture control
- **Consequence**: Without breaking opponent's posture through opposite-side control, they can maintain strong base despite worm control, reducing sweep effectiveness and allowing defensive passing strategies.
- **Correction**: Always control opposite sleeve and actively break their posture forward and to the side. Use sleeve grip to prevent them from establishing strong posting hand. Combine lapel control with aggressive posture breaking.
- **Recognition**: If opponent maintains upright, comfortable posture despite worm control, you lack proper opposite-side disruption. They should feel off-balanced and broken down.

### Error: Static hip position without angle creation
- **Consequence**: Even with proper worm control, static hips allow opponent to stabilize and work systematic counters. Reduces sweep effectiveness and makes position predictable.
- **Correction**: Constantly adjust hip angles—move laterally, create angles toward trapped leg side, use hip movement to generate off-balancing forces. Worm control stabilizes, but hips create attacks.
- **Recognition**: If you feel stuck in worm position without generating sweep pressure, your hips are too static. Should feel dynamic movement creating constant threats.

### Error: Over-reliance on worm guard without backup systems
- **Consequence**: Opponents who train worm guard counters regularly can shut down the position, and if it's your only guard, they'll pass. Over-specialization creates exploitable weakness.
- **Correction**: Develop worm guard as part of broader guard system including spider, DLR, and standard lapel guards. Have clear transitions when worm is countered. Use worm strategically rather than exclusively.
- **Recognition**: If experienced opponents consistently pass your guard because they know worm counters, you're over-reliant. Should have multiple guard options.

### Error: Attempting worm guard without sufficient technical understanding
- **Consequence**: Worm guard is technically complex; attempting it with poor understanding leads to ineffective control and easy passes. Half-learned worm guard is worse than standard guards.
- **Correction**: Study instructional material from Keenan Cornelius, attend seminars if possible, drill extensively with experienced training partner who knows the position. Invest proper time in learning before using in competition.
- **Recognition**: If you're frequently losing worm guard to basic counters or can't maintain position, your technical understanding is insufficient. Need systematic study.

### Error: Poor management of free leg distance
- **Consequence**: Free leg too close allows smash passing; too far reduces your ability to finish sweeps or create pressure. Poor distance management defeats purpose of worm control.
- **Correction**: Use free leg actively—foot on hip, knee, or bicep to manage ideal distance. Adjust based on opponent's pressure and passing attempts. Free leg is as important as wrapped leg.
- **Recognition**: If opponent easily collapses onto you or you can't reach them to finish sweeps, your free leg management is wrong. Should maintain optimal distance throughout.

## Training Drills

### Drill 1: Worm Guard Entry Sequences
Start from standard open guard, practice extracting lapel, feeding it through opponent's leg, and wrapping around your shin with partner at 25% resistance. Focus on smooth, efficient entry that maintains control throughout. Partner provides feedback on lapel depth and tension. Progress to 50%, 75% resistance as entry improves. Emphasize simultaneous establishment of opposite sleeve control and proper hip positioning. 5 minute rounds, 3-4 rounds, with rest between to review technique details. Goal is confident, automatic worm establishment from various open guard positions.

### Drill 2: Worm Guard Sweep Mechanics
With worm guard established (start from established position), practice specific sweep mechanics against progressive resistance (start 25%). Partner maintains defensive base while you work off-balancing and sweep execution. Focus on hip angle creation, lapel tension maintenance through sweep, and coordinated use of both legs. Partner increases to 50%, 75%, 90% as your sweeps become more effective. 3 minutes per resistance level, 4-5 rounds total, with coaching feedback on mechanical execution. Build power and precision in sweep finish.

### Drill 3: Worm to Back Take Transitions
Practice flowing from worm guard directly to back control through various paths (inverted back take, technical stand-up back take, squid transition back take). Start with compliant partner (0% resistance) to learn movement patterns, progress to 50%, then 75% resistance. Focus on maintaining connection through transition, reading opponent's defensive reactions, and timing your back take entries. 2 minute rounds, 6-8 rounds covering different back take variations, with video review to identify improvement areas. Goal is high-percentage back take from worm position.

### Drill 4: Worm Guard Defense and Transitions
Partner attempts specific worm guard counters (lapel clear, back step, cartwheel, pressure pass) while you practice recognizing counter early and transitioning to squid guard, lapel guard variations, or DLR system (50% resistance initially). Goal is fluid adaptation when worm is being successfully countered. Partner increases to 75% intensity as your transitions improve. Focus on reading defensive cues, making early decisions, and maintaining offensive position despite position changes. 3 minute rounds, 4-5 rounds, with partner mixing counter types. Should develop sensitivity to when to fight for worm versus when to transition.

### Drill 5: Worm Guard Position Sparring
Start every round with worm guard established, then free spar with goal of sweeping, submitting, or taking back (you) or passing guard (partner). Partner begins at 50% resistance, progressing to 75%, then 100% live rolling over multiple sessions. Reset to worm guard after each successful action. Focus on all learned principles: lapel tension, posture breaking, hip movement, sweep mechanics, back take timing, and transition decisions. 5 minute rounds, 5-6 rounds per session, with coaching feedback between rounds. Build live application against increasing resistance levels.
