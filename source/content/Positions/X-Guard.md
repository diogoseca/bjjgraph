# X-Guard
#bjj #state #guard #leg_entanglement #open_guard

## State Properties
- **State ID**: S012
- **Point Value**: 0 (Neutral with strong offensive advantage)
- **Position Type**: Offensive control position
- **Risk Level**: Medium
- **Energy Cost**: Medium to High
- **Time Sustainability**: Medium

## State Description
X-Guard is an advanced open guard variation where the bottom player entangles one of the opponent's legs, using both of their own legs to control it while creating strong leverage for sweeps and transitions. This position provides exceptional control over the opponent's balance and mobility, creating powerful sweeping opportunities and serving as a gateway to various leg entanglements. X-Guard is characterized by the "X" formation created by the bottom player's legs around the opponent's leg.

## Visual Description

You are on your back or partially seated with both of your legs forming an X-shaped entanglement around one of your opponent's legs, your top leg hooking over the outside of their thigh while your bottom leg hooks under and inside their same leg, creating a scissoring control. Your opponent stands on their free leg above you, their trapped leg elevated and completely controlled between your crossed legs, severely compromising their balance and ability to generate base. Your hands typically grip their pants at the ankle or knee of the trapped leg, or control their belt, collar, or other leg to prevent them from establishing a stable base or initiating passing sequences. The opponent's weight is unevenly distributed, forced to balance on one leg while you control the other, their upper body often leaning or shifting as they struggle to maintain equilibrium. Your hips remain mobile, able to generate angles and leverage by extending or retracting your legs, while your back may be flat or partially elevated depending on the specific sweeping or transitional attack you're setting up. This configuration creates a powerful mechanical advantage where small hip movements translate into large disruptions of your opponent's balance, making them vulnerable to sweeps in multiple directions while providing direct entries into modern leg entanglement systems.

## Key Principles
- Control opponent's base leg through proper leg positioning
- Maintain upper body connection through grips
- Create and exploit leverage through extension and retraction
- Manipulate opponent's weight distribution to set up sweeps
- Prevent opponent from establishing base or counters
- Transition seamlessly between X-Guard variations

## Prerequisites
- Hip mobility and hamstring flexibility
- Understanding of leverage mechanics
- Basic sweeping principles
- Familiarity with leg positioning control

## State Invariants
- One of opponent's legs controlled between your legs
- Upper leg wrapped around outside of opponent's controlled leg
- Lower leg hooking inside of opponent's controlled leg
- Control of opponent's other leg or upper body to prevent stabilization

## Defensive Responses (When Opponent Has This State)
- [[Base Widening]] → [[X-Guard Defense]]
- [[Leg Kick-Through]] → [[Standing up]]
- [[Hip Pressure]] → [[Smash Pass]]
- [[Hand Fighting]] → [[Grip Fighting]]

## Offensive Transitions (Available From This State)
- [[Classic X-Guard Sweep]] → [[Top Position]]
- [[Technical Standup]] → [[Top Position]]
- [[X-Guard to Single Leg X]] → [[Single Leg X Guard]]
- [[X-Guard to Ashi Garami]] → [[Ashi Garami]]
- [[Reverse X Transition]] → [[Reverse X Guard]]
- [[Ankle Pick from X-Guard]] → [[Top Position]]
- [[Kiss of the Dragon]] → [[Back Control]]

## Counter Transitions
- [[Guard Recovery System]] → [[X-Guard]] (against escape attempts)
- [[Transition to Butterfly]] → [[Butterfly Guard]] (if position is compromised)
- [[Shin-to-Shin Fallback]] → [[Shin-to-Shin Guard]] (under pressure)

## Expert Insights
- **Danaher System**: Views X-Guard as part of the "Lower Body Trinity" along with Single Leg X and Butterfly Guard. Emphasizes precise mechanical control with a focus on breaking the opponent's balance backward before executing sweeps. Creates systematic connections between X-Guard and leg entanglements as part of a comprehensive lower body attack system.
- **Gordon Ryan**: Uses X-Guard as a powerful control position with a focus on creating dynamic weight transfers that force predictable reactions. Often employs it as part of complex transitions, moving between X-Guard, Single Leg X, and Reverse X to set up both sweeps and entries to leg entanglements.
- **Eddie Bravo**: Incorporates X-Guard within the 10th Planet system with unique entries and transitions to leg lock positions. Emphasizes creative gripping strategies and often connects X-Guard to the lockdown and Rubber Guard systems through specialized transition sequences.

## Common Errors
- Poor leg positioning → Reduced leverage and control
- Neglecting upper body connections → Escape opportunities
- Static positioning → Predictable patterns
- Overextending → Loss of control structure
- Premature sweep attempts → Failed offensive opportunities

## Training Drills
- X-Guard entry from various positions
- Transition flows between X-Guard variations
- Elevation and control drills with increasing resistance
- Sweep combinations with follow-ups
- Defense prevention and counter drills

## Related States
- [[Single Leg X Guard]] - Similar leg entanglement with different configuration
- [[Butterfly Guard]] - Common entry position to X-Guard
- [[Reverse X Guard]] - Inverted variation with different control angles
- [[Ashi Garami]] - Leg entanglement often entered from X-Guard
- [[Shin-to-Shin Guard]] - Preliminary control position for X-Guard entry

- [[Ashi Garami]] - Related position
- [[Single Leg X Guard]] - Related position
- [[Butterfly Guard]] - Related position
- [[Shin-to-Shin Guard]] - Related position
- [[Top Position]] - Related position

## Decision Tree
If opponent stands tall with weight on trapped leg:
- Execute [[Classic X-Guard Sweep]]

Else if opponent shifts weight backward:
- Execute [[Technical Standup]]

Else if opponent drives forward with pressure:
- Execute [[X-Guard to Single Leg X]]

Else if opponent attempts to kick through:
- Execute [[Kiss of the Dragon]]

## Position Metrics
- Success Rate: 70% offensive advancement (competition data)
- Average Time in Position: 15-40 seconds
- Sweep Probability: 65%
- Submission Entry Probability: 40%
- Position Loss Probability: 25%

## Optimal Paths
Highest-percentage sweeping path:
[[X-Guard]] → [[Technical Standup]] → [[Top Position]] → [[Side Control]] → [[Mount]] → submission chain

Leg lock-oriented path:
[[X-Guard]] → [[X-Guard to Ashi Garami]] → [[Inside Sankaku]] → [[Inside Heel Hook]] → [[Won by Submission]]

Back-taking path:
[[X-Guard]] → [[Kiss of the Dragon]] → [[Back Control]] → [[Rear Naked Choke]] → [[Won by Submission]]

## Computer Science Analogy
X-Guard functions as a specialized node in the BJJ state graph with high connectivity to both conventional positional paths and the modern leg lock system. It represents an efficient "routing algorithm" that allows navigation from defensive positions to dominant offensive outcomes through calculated weight manipulation and leverage.
