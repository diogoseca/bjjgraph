## State Properties

- **Position Type**: Defensive/offensive hybrid guard
- **Risk Level**: Medium
- **Energy Cost**: Medium to High
- **Time Sustainability**: Medium

## State Description
Reverse De La Riva Guard (RDLR) is a modern guard variation that emerged as a counter to specific passing strategies, particularly the knee cut and leg drag passes. The position is characterized by the bottom player hooking the opponent's non-passing leg with their outside leg, while the inside leg creates a frame across the opponent's hip or thigh. RDLR serves as both a defensive position to prevent passes and an offensive launching pad for sweeps, back takes, and transitions to other guards, making it a crucial component of the modern guard system.

## Key Principles
- Hook opponent's non-passing leg with your outside leg
- Frame against opponent's passing hip with your inside leg
- Control opponent's sleeve/wrist or collar with far-side arm
- Establish belt/hip grip with near-side arm when possible
- Maintain spine angle to prevent flattening
- Create and exploit leverage through strategic hooks and frames
- Manage distance to counter passing pressure while maintaining offensive options

## Prerequisites
- Hip mobility and flexibility
- Understanding of modern passing counters
- Familiarity with inversion mechanics
- Frame coordination and control
- Defensive awareness and timing

## State Invariants
- Outside leg hooking opponent's non-passing leg
- Inside leg positioned as frame against opponent's hip/thigh
- Upper body control through grips and posture
- Angled positioning rather than flat on back
- Active hip movement and connectivity

## Defensive Responses (When Opponent Has This State)
- [[Knee Cut Force]] → [[Knee Cut Pass]]
- [[Double Unders Pass]] → [[Double Unders Control]]
- [[Leg Drag Completion]] → [[Leg Drag Position]]
- [[RDLR Smash]] → [[Smash Pass Position]]
- [[Long Step Pass]] → [[Side Control]]

## Offensive Transitions (Available From This State)
- [[RDLR Inversion]] → [[Berimbolo]]
- [[Kiss of the Dragon]] → [[Back Control]]
- [[RDLR to Single Leg X]] → [[Single Leg X Guard]]
- [[Reverse X Transition]] → [[Reverse X Guard]]
- [[RDLR to X-Guard]] → [[X-Guard]]
- [[RDLR Back Take]] → [[Back Control]]
- [[Technical Stand-up]] → [[Single Leg Takedown]]
- [[RDLR to De La Riva]] → [[De La Riva Guard]]

## Counter Transitions
- [[Re-establish RDLR]] → [[Reverse De La Riva Guard]] (against pass attempts)
- [[Invert to Recover]] → [[Reverse De La Riva Guard]] (when pressured)
- [[Switch to DLR]] → [[De La Riva Guard]] (if angle changes)

## Expert Insights
- **Danaher System**: Views RDLR primarily as a defensive position used to counter specific passing strategies. Emphasizes the mechanics of proper framing and hip movement to prevent passing while setting up transitions to more offensively oriented positions like Single Leg X and X-Guard.
- **Gordon Ryan**: Utilizes RDLR extensively as both a defensive recovery position and as a launching pad for back takes via berimbolo variations. Emphasizes subtle weight shifting and grip fighting details that facilitate offensive transitions while maintaining defensive integrity.
- **Eddie Bravo**: Incorporates RDLR principles into the 10th Planet system with modified gripping strategies suitable for no-gi. Often connects RDLR to the lockdown and rubber guard systems through specialized transition sequences, focusing on creating unique angles and leverage points.

## Common Errors
- Passive hook placement → Ineffective control
- Weak inside leg frame → Vulnerability to knee cut
- Flat back positioning → Loss of defensive structure
- Focusing solely on defense → Missing offensive opportunities
- Poor grip management → Inability to control opponent's movements

## Training Drills
- RDLR maintenance against progressive passing pressure
- Transition flows between RDLR and related guards
- Inversion technique and recovery exercises
- Grip fighting and control sequences
- Berimbolo and back take entries with resistance

- [[X-Guard]] - Related leg control position
- [[Half Guard Bottom]] - Alternative defensive position
- [[Butterfly Guard]] - Complementary guard system

## Decision Tree
If opponent attempts knee cut pass:
- Execute [[RDLR to Single Leg X]] or [[Kiss of the Dragon]]

Else if opponent attempts leg drag:
- Execute [[RDLR Inversion]] → [[Berimbolo]]

Else if opponent stands tall:
- Execute [[RDLR Back Take]] or [[Technical Stand-up]]

Else if opponent drives weight forward:
- Execute [[Reverse X Transition]] or [[RDLR to X-Guard]]

## Position Metrics
- Success Rate: 70% defensive retention (competition data)
- Average Time in Position: 20-45 seconds
- Sweep Probability: 40%
- Back Take Probability: 30%
- Position Loss Probability: 30%

## Optimal Paths
Back-taking path:
[[Reverse De La Riva Guard]] → [[RDLR Inversion]] → [[Berimbolo]] → [[Back Control]] → [[Rear Naked Choke]] → [[Won by Submission]]

Leg lock path:
[[Reverse De La Riva Guard]] → [[RDLR to Single Leg X]] → [[Single Leg X Guard]] → [[Ashi Garami]] → [[Inside Heel Hook]] → [[Won by Submission]]

Sweep path:
[[Reverse De La Riva Guard]] → [[RDLR to X-Guard]] → [[X-Guard]] → [[Technical Stand-up Sweep]] → [[Top Position]]

## Computer Science Analogy
RDLR functions as an adaptive response algorithm in the BJJ state graph, specifically designed to counter certain passing patterns (knee cut, leg drag). It implements a "conditional branching" logic where defensive responses trigger predetermined offensive sequences. The position can be modeled as a state with high branch factor but specialized effectiveness against certain opponent states, similar to how specific algorithms are optimized to handle particular input patterns.
