# Truck Position Top
#bjj #state #truck #top #offensive #10thplanet

## State Properties
- **State ID**: S093
- **Point Value**: 4 (Considered back control variant)
- **Position Type**: Offensive submission position
- **Risk Level**: Low
- **Energy Cost**: Low to Medium
- **Time Sustainability**: Medium

## State Description
The Truck Position Top is a dominant back attack variation where you control your opponent from behind with their legs entangled, using your boot (foot) pressed against their hip to create torque and control while hunting for twister, calf slicer, banana split, or back control finishes. Popularized by Eddie Bravo and the 10th Planet Jiu-Jitsu system, this position represents an evolution of traditional back control that emphasizes leg entanglement and spinal attacks. The truck creates a unique control system where the opponent is trapped on their side, unable to effectively defend multiple simultaneous submission threats.

The position's power comes from the dilemma it creates: defending the upper body (twister) exposes the lower body (calf slicer/banana split), while defending the lower body allows upper body attacks. This multiple-threat system makes the truck one of the highest finishing-rate positions in modern BJJ. The boot control is the engine of the position, creating the torque that enables all subsequent attacks.

### Visual Description
You are positioned behind and partially on top of your opponent who is on their side with their back exposed to you. Your legs are entangled with theirs, typically with one of your legs hooking their lower leg while your other leg's foot (boot) presses firmly against their hip or thigh, creating pressure that controls their orientation. Your boot creates a constant pushing force that twists their body and prevents them from turning to face you or rolling through to escape. Your arms control their upper body, with one arm typically reaching across their chest toward their far shoulder (twister position) or controlling their near arm, while your other arm may be working on further controls or adjusting positions. Your chest is against their back or upper shoulder, creating weight and pressure that pins them. Your head position varies based on which submission you're setting up, but typically stays mobile to adjust to their defensive movements. This configuration creates a position where the opponent is corkscrewed between your leg pressure and upper body control, unable to generate effective escape movements while you systematically work through your submission attacks.

## Key Principles
- **Boot Pressure Maintenance**: Constant hip/thigh pressure controls opponent orientation
- **Leg Entanglement Control**: Tangled legs restrict opponent mobility
- **Multiple Threat System**: Chain between twister, calf slicer, banana split
- **Upper-Lower Body Connection**: Coordinate leg and arm attacks
- **Slow Methodical Attacks**: Position rewards patience over rushing
- **Dilemma Creation**: Force opponent to choose which attack to defend
- **Back Control Option**: Always available as fallback position

## Prerequisites
- Understanding of back take mechanics
- Knowledge of leg entanglement systems
- Experience with crab ride position
- Familiarity with twister mechanics and safety

## State Invariants
- Boot pressed against opponent's hip/thigh
- Opponent on their side with back exposed

## Expert Insights
- **John Danaher**: "The truck represents an interesting positional innovation that exploits the mechanical vulnerabilities created when leg entanglement meets back exposure. While I don't emphasize the truck as heavily as traditional back control in my systematic approach, I recognize its effectiveness as a finishing position when the entry presents itself. The key technical insight is understanding that the boot control creates a fulcrum that amplifies all other control and attack mechanisms—without the boot, the position collapses. The twister itself is a powerful submission, but practitioners must exercise extreme caution in training due to its spinal attack nature. From a systematic perspective, I teach the truck as an opportunistic position rather than a destination, always ready to consolidate to traditional back control when the opponent's defense proves sound."

- **Gordon Ryan**: "I don't hunt for the truck position actively in my game, but when the entry presents itself—particularly from turtle or half guard back takes—I use it to finish immediately or force the opponent into worse positions. The calf slicer from truck is my highest percentage attack because it's less familiar to most opponents than the twister, and the pain comes on quickly, leading to fast taps. In competition, I'm always aware that the truck can be controversial with some referees regarding back point criteria, so I typically use it as a quick finishing attempt before transitioning to standard back control. The position works best against opponents who aren't specifically trained in 10th Planet systems, as those familiar with the truck have developed specific defenses that make finishing more challenging."

- **Eddie Bravo**: "The truck is a cornerstone of the 10th Planet system—it's our answer to the guard pass-to-back control sequence that traditional BJJ emphasizes. What makes the truck revolutionary is the multiple submission threats it creates from a single position. Students often make the mistake of fixating on the twister, but the real power is in the submission chains: threaten the twister and they defend high, hit the calf slicer low; defend the calf slicer and they expose the banana split or electric chair. The boot control is everything—if you lose that pressure, the position falls apart. We drill truck entries from everywhere: turtle, half guard, rubber guard, even standing. The key innovation is recognizing that back control doesn't have to look like traditional back control to be effective. The truck proves that leg entanglement combined with back exposure creates finishes that traditional positions can't access."

## Common Errors
- **Error**: Losing boot pressure during submission attempts
  - **Consequence**: Opponent escapes the torque control and can roll through or untangle legs, losing the dominant position entirely.
  - **Correction**: Maintain constant boot pressure even while working upper body attacks; the boot is the foundation of all control.
  - **Recognition**: If opponent seems mobile or can change orientation easily, boot pressure is insufficient.

- **Error**: Rushing the twister without proper setup
  - **Consequence**: Opponent defends easily and escapes because the position wasn't fully established.
  - **Correction**: Ensure leg entanglement and boot control are solid before committing to twister grip; use feints and alternative attacks to create openings.
  - **Recognition**: If opponent sees the twister coming and defends before you're close to finishing, you rushed.

- **Error**: Ignoring opponent's boot grip defense
  - **Consequence**: Opponent grabs and controls your boot, eventually peeling it off and escaping the truck.
  - **Correction**: Adjust boot angle and pressure when grabbed, or transition to alternative attack while boot is defended.
  - **Recognition**: If opponent successfully removes your boot, you ignored their defense too long.

- **Error**: Applying twister too aggressively in training
  - **Consequence**: Risk of serious spinal injury to training partner, losing training partners, or developing bad safety habits.
  - **Correction**: Apply all truck submissions slowly and progressively, giving partner ample time to tap; never crank or jerk the twister.
  - **Recognition**: If partner doesn't tap and is in danger, you're going too hard.

- **Error**: Not transitioning to back control when needed
  - **Consequence**: Wastes time in truck when opponent has solid defense, missing scoring opportunities or better submission setups.
  - **Correction**: Recognize when truck submissions aren't developing quickly and transition to traditional back control for points and new attacks.
  - **Recognition**: If you're in truck for more than 30-45 seconds without submission progress, transition.

## Training Drills
- **Boot Control Maintenance**: Partner attempts to clear your boot while you maintain pressure, practicing adjustment angles and pressure (progressive resistance).

- **Submission Chain Drilling**: Flow between twister, calf slicer, banana split based on partner's defensive reactions, developing threat recognition.

- **Truck Entry Sequences**: Practice entering truck from turtle, crab ride, half guard, and scramble situations, focusing on quick boot establishment.

- **Twister Finish Mechanics**: Slowly drill twister completion with partner tapping early, developing proper technique and safety awareness.

- **Truck to Back Transition**: When partner defends truck effectively, practice smooth transition to traditional back control hooks.
