# Crucifix Control Position
#bjj #state #dominant #crucifix #submission

## State Properties
- **State ID**: S213
- **Point Value**: 4 (Back control variation)
- **Position Type**: Offensive/Controlling
- **Risk Level**: Low
- **Energy Cost**: Medium
- **Time Sustainability**: Medium

## State Description
Crucifix Control Position is an extremely dominant control position where both of the opponent's arms are isolated and controlled, rendering them defenseless. The controlling practitioner typically has their legs threaded through or hooking the opponent's arms while simultaneously controlling their body, usually from a back or side position. This configuration creates a "crucified" appearance, hence the name. The position offers nearly complete submission control with minimal risk of escape or counter-attack.

The crucifix is considered one of the most dominant positions in grappling due to the complete helplessness it creates. With both arms trapped, the opponent cannot defend chokes, frame for escapes, or post for base. It represents the pinnacle of positional control before submission, combining elements of back control with arm isolation. Modern BJJ has developed sophisticated entry systems into crucifix from turtle, failed guard passes, and scrambles.

## Visual Description

The controlling practitioner is typically positioned on the opponent's side or back, with their legs threaded through and controlling both of the opponent's arms. One leg (typically the inside leg) threads under the opponent's near arm at the shoulder, hooking across their chest or neck. The other leg threads over the opponent's far arm, hooking behind their back or around their body. The opponent is trapped on their side or face-down with both arms extended and isolated, unable to bring them back to defend. The controller's upper body is free to attack, with hands available to secure chokes or armlocks. The opponent's head and neck are completely exposed with no arm defense available. Body weight pins the opponent through the legs while the upper body remains mobile for submissions. The configuration creates a mechanical cage where any movement by the opponent only tightens the control. This position combines the psychological despair of complete helplessness with the physical reality that escape is nearly impossible without the controlling player making an error.

## Key Principles
- **Arm Isolation**: Both arms must be trapped and extended, unable to return to defensive positions
- **Leg Threading**: Legs create the control structure by threading through opponent's arms
- **Body Control**: Weight distribution pins opponent while keeping controller mobile
- **Neck Exposure**: Position creates clear pathway to opponent's neck with no arm defense
- **Patience**: No need to rush submissions, control is overwhelming
- **Multiple Attacks**: Chain submissions forcing opponent to choose which defense attempt

## Prerequisites
- Entry from turtle top, failed guard pass defense, or scrambles
- Understanding of leg threading and control mechanics
- Ability to maintain complex leg positions while attacking
- Recognition of crucifix opportunities during transitions

## State Invariants
- Both opponent's arms isolated and controlled
- Legs threaded through opponent's arm structure
- Opponent on side or face-down
- Controller has free hands for submissions
- Opponent cannot defend with arms

## Expert Insights
- **John Danaher**: "The crucifix is the logical endpoint of arm isolation strategy. When you successfully separate both of the opponent's arms from their defensive duties simultaneously, you create a situation where they have no good options. The crucifix demonstrates a key principle: control the arms, control the person. From here, you can attack at leisure with submissions while the opponent can only wait and hope you make an error. The position is so dominant that merely achieving it often results in immediate psychological submission."

- **Gordon Ryan**: "Crucifix is my favorite position to submit people from because they literally can't do anything. I hunt for it constantly from turtle, and I've developed specific entries from various positions. The key is not rushing the submission - once you have the crucifix, you've already won. Take your time, set up the perfect choke, and if they defend that, there's an armbar. It's the ultimate no-win position for your opponent."

- **Eddie Bravo**: "The crucifix is huge in 10th Planet, especially how we enter it from the truck position. Marcelo Garcia popularized the turtle entries, but we've taken it further by creating systematic pathways from rubber guard and other positions. What makes it special is the opponent knows they're screwed - that psychological defeat is as important as the physical control. We teach students to hunt for the crucifix, not just accept it when it appears."

## Common Errors

### Error: Insufficient leg threading allowing arm escape
- **Consequence**: If legs aren't deeply threaded through opponent's arms, they can pull their arms back to defensive positions, escaping the crucifix entirely. Control collapses and opponent regains ability to defend or escape.
- **Correction**: Thread legs deep through the shoulder line, not just through the crook of the elbow. Hooks should be tight and active, constantly pulling to maintain arm extension. Think of legs as a cage that must remain closed.
- **Recognition**: If opponent's arm is bending significantly or they're pulling it back toward their body, threading is insufficient.

### Error: Rushing submissions without solidifying control
- **Consequence**: Attempting submissions before crucifix structure is secure allows opponent to escape during the transition. Premature attacks sacrifice positional dominance for low-percentage submissions. Position is more valuable than rushed finish.
- **Correction**: First, ensure both arms are fully isolated and legs are properly positioned with good weight distribution. Only then begin attacking. Take 3-5 seconds to perfect control before hunting submissions. The crucifix itself is worth 4 points and guarantees submission opportunities.
- **Recognition**: If you're losing crucifix control while attempting submissions, you rushed the attack before solidifying the position.

### Error: Poor weight distribution allowing opponent to roll
- **Consequence**: If weight is positioned incorrectly, opponent can generate rolling momentum that disrupts the crucifix structure. They may roll into you, collapsing your leg hooks and freeing their arms. Position is lost through lack of proper pinning.
- **Correction**: Distribute weight to prevent rolling in either direction. Usually requires keeping your chest low and using your body weight to pin their hips or shoulder. Adjust weight dynamically as they attempt to move. Stay heavy and connected.
- **Recognition**: If opponent successfully rolls or bridges despite crucifix structure, your weight distribution was faulty.

### Error: Focusing on only one arm instead of controlling both
- **Consequence**: Controlling only one arm creates a half-crucifix that allows opponent to use their free arm to defend chokes, create frames, or work escapes. Position loses its defining characteristic of complete helplessness.
- **Correction**: Crucifix requires both arms isolated simultaneously. If you can only control one arm, this is not crucifix - it's a different position. Work to capture the second arm before considering it a crucifix. Both legs must be actively trapping.
- **Recognition**: If opponent can touch their own body with one hand or defend choke attempts, you don't have true crucifix control.

### Error: Losing connection during submission attempts
- **Consequence**: Reaching too far for submissions or compromising body position to finish allows opponent to exploit gaps in control. They may slip an arm free or create space to begin escapes. Submission attempt costs the position.
- **Correction**: Maintain close connection with core and hips throughout all submission attempts. Don't overextend arms to finish chokes - stay tight and use efficient mechanics. If you must choose between maintaining position and finishing, choose position first.
- **Recognition**: If crucifix structure breaks down during submission attempt and opponent escapes or improves position, you disconnected too much.

## Training Drills

### Drill 1: Crucifix Entry from Turtle
Partner starts in turtle position. Practicing partner works various entries to crucifix: from overhook control, from clock position, from failed guard pass situations. Once crucifix is established, hold for 10 seconds focusing on control structure, then reset. Progress from cooperative (0% resistance) to 60% resistance. 5-minute rounds. Focus: Clean entries, proper leg threading depth, immediate weight distribution, recognizing entry opportunities.

### Drill 2: Crucifix Maintenance Challenge
Start with crucifix established. Bottom person attempts various escape methods (pulling arms in, rolling, bridging, going to guard) at progressive resistance (40%, 60%, 80%). Top person maintains crucifix structure through all attempts. 3-minute rounds. Focus: Adjusting weight distribution, re-threading legs when necessary, staying connected, patience under pressure. If position is lost, analyze what broke down.

### Drill 3: Submission Chains from Crucifix
Establish crucifix. Practice flowing between different submissions: RNC attempt → if they defend, switch to far arm straight armbar → if they defend that, switch to near arm attack → clock choke. Start at 40% defensive resistance, build to 70%. 4-minute rounds alternating. Focus: Maintaining control through transitions, reading defensive attempts, smooth flow between submissions, never releasing pressure.

### Drill 4: Positional Sparring - Crucifix or Turtle
Start in turtle position. Practicing partner works to establish crucifix, turtle player works to prevent it and escape turtle. If crucifix is achieved, defender has 30 seconds to escape or must reset. Live resistance (90-100%). 5-minute rounds. Focus: For top - recognizing entries and capturing crucifix quickly. For bottom - preventing arm isolation and escaping before crucifix solidifies. Realistic competition pacing.

### Drill 5: Back to Crucifix Flow
Start in back control with hooks. Practice rolling or transitioning to crucifix position, maintaining control throughout. Then reverse: crucifix to back control. Flow back and forth smoothly. Partner provides 50% resistance. 4-minute rounds. Focus: Understanding relationship between these dominant positions, smooth transitions maintaining control, never releasing the opponent, using transitions to set up submissions.

## Related Positions
- [[Back Control]] - Parent position, crucifix is often entered from back control
- [[Turtle Top]] - Common starting position for crucifix entries
- [[Mount]] - Alternative dominant position, can transition from crucifix
- [[Truck Position]] - 10th Planet system entry point to crucifix
- [[Armbar Control]] - Submission position often accessed from crucifix
- [[Clock Choke Position]] - Specific submission setup from crucifix in gi

## Optimal Submission Paths

**Fastest path to submission** (direct attack):
[[Crucifix Control Position]] → [[Rear Naked Choke from Crucifix]] → [[Won by Submission]]
*Reasoning: RNC is immediately available with perfect control and no arm defense possible. Highest percentage direct submission from crucifix.*

**High-percentage path** (systematic):
[[Crucifix Control Position]] → [[Set Up Clock Choke]] → [[Won by Submission]]
*Reasoning: Clock choke in gi is extremely high percentage from crucifix due to collar control and arm isolation. Very difficult to defend.*

**Alternative submission path** (arm attack):
[[Crucifix Control Position]] → [[Straight Armbar from Crucifix]] → [[Won by Submission]]
*Reasoning: When opponent defends neck desperately, extended arms are vulnerable to straight armbar. Creates submission dilemma.*

**Multiple attack path** (chain submissions):
[[Crucifix Control Position]] → [[RNC Attempt]] → [[Armbar from Crucifix]] → [[Won by Submission]]
*Reasoning: Attacking neck forces arm defense, exposing arms for armlocks. Creates no-win scenario where defending one attack opens another.*

## Decision Tree

**If** opponent tucks chin to defend rear naked choke:
- Execute [[Straight Armbar from Crucifix]] → [[Won by Submission]] (Probability: 85%)
  - Reasoning: Chin tuck means they're focused on neck, both arms are extended and vulnerable
- Or Execute [[Clock Choke]] (gi) → [[Won by Submission]] (Probability: 80%)
  - Reasoning: Clock choke bypasses chin defense by attacking from different angle

**Else if** opponent tries to pull one arm in:
- Execute [[Re-isolate Arm]] → [[Crucifix Control Position]] (Probability: 90%)
  - Reasoning: Re-extend the arm using leg pressure before attempting submissions
- Or Execute [[Attack Opposite Arm]] → [[Armbar]] (Probability: 75%)
  - Reasoning: Their focus on one arm leaves other arm vulnerable

**Else if** opponent remains still and defensive:
- Execute [[Rear Naked Choke from Crucifix]] → [[Won by Submission]] (Probability: 88%)
  - Reasoning: Static defense allows perfect choke setup with no arm defense
- Or Execute [[Bow and Arrow Choke]] (gi) → [[Won by Submission]] (Probability: 82%)
  - Reasoning: Gi allows high-percentage bow and arrow with perfect control

**Else if** opponent tries to roll:
- Execute [[Adjust Weight]] → [[Maintain Crucifix]] (Probability: 92%)
  - Reasoning: Rolling attempts are easily controlled with proper weight distribution
- Or Execute [[Roll to Mount]] → [[Mount]] (Probability: 85%)
  - Reasoning: Use their rolling momentum to transition to mount while maintaining dominance

**Else** (opponent exhausted or not defending):
- Execute [[Perfect RNC Setup]] → [[Won by Submission]] (Probability: 95%)
  - Reasoning: Take time to set up textbook rear naked choke with no rush
- Or Execute [[Armbar Finish]] → [[Won by Submission]] (Probability: 90%)
  - Reasoning: Lack of defense allows choice of any submission with high success

## Position Metrics
- Success Rate: 92% retention (competition data - extremely high)
- Average Time in Position: 30-90 seconds (typically ends in submission)
- Submission Probability: Beginner 52%, Intermediate 68%, Advanced 82%
- Escape Probability (opponent): Beginner 8%, Intermediate 5%, Advanced 3%
- Position Advancement: 95% (either submission or maintained dominance)
- Psychological Impact: Maximum - opponent often taps preemptively
