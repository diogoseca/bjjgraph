# Triangle Escape Position
#bjj #state #defensive #submission-defense #triangle-escape

## State Properties
- **State ID**: S102
- **Point Value**: 0 (Defensive position, no positional points awarded)
- **Position Type**: Defensive/Survival-Oriented
- **Risk Level**: High
- **Energy Cost**: High
- **Time Sustainability**: Short

## State Description
Triangle Escape Position represents the critical defensive state where a practitioner is caught in an opponent's triangle choke configuration and must execute systematic defensive techniques to avoid submission while working toward positional escape. This is one of BJJ's most dangerous defensive scenarios, requiring immediate defensive priorities (maintaining breathing space and blood flow) combined with methodical escape execution to break the triangle lock and recover to safer positions. The position demands understanding of the triangle's mechanical structure, including leg positioning, angle creation, and choking mechanisms, to effectively counter and escape.

Unlike some defensive positions where time works in the defender's favor, triangle escape position becomes progressively more dangerous as the attacking practitioner refines their control and angle, making quick decisive defensive action critical. Success in this position often determines match outcomes, as triangle chokes represent high-percentage submissions when properly applied.

## Visual Description

From the defensive practitioner's perspective, you find yourself with one arm trapped inside opponent's guard configuration while your head and other arm are positioned outside their leg triangle. Your trapped arm is typically across your own neck alongside your head, with opponent's legs forming a locked triangle around your neck and shoulder. The opponent has one leg crossed over the other behind your head or shoulder, creating a tightening mechanism that compresses your neck and restricts blood flow when they squeeze. Your body position is bent forward with your head lower than your hips in dangerous posture, giving the opponent gravitational and leverage advantages. Your free arm has critical responsibility for maintaining some posture and preventing complete angle optimization by opponent. The spatial relationship creates visible stress on your neck and breathing, with pressure increasing when opponent angles their body perpendicular to yours or pulls your head down while extending their hips. Your trapped arm position prevents easy extraction as pulling creates more tightness in the triangle configuration. The opponent's shin across your neck creates the primary choking pressure while their crossed ankle behind your head locks the position preventing easy separation.

## Key Principles
- Maintain emergency breathing space as absolute first priority before attempting escape
- Establish strong defensive posture by driving weight forward onto opponent to prevent angle creation
- Control opponent's hip with free arm to limit their body angling and position optimization
- Create systematic space progression starting from relieving immediate pressure before full escape
- Keep trapped arm position awareness to prevent increased tightness during escape attempts
- Use base and posture maintenance to neutralize opponent's leverage advantages
- Execute escape techniques with steady pressure rather than explosive movements that create openings

## Prerequisites
- Triangle choke established by opponent with legs locked
- One arm trapped inside triangle configuration
- Head and opposite arm positioned outside triangle
- Opponent applying or attempting to apply choking pressure

## State Invariants
- Opponent's legs forming triangle around neck and shoulder
- One arm trapped in dangerous position across own neck
- Choking pressure present or imminent requiring defensive response
- Defensive practitioner in compressed forward posture under opponent's control

- [[Space Creation]] → [[Triangle Escape Position]] (Success Rate: 30%)

## Offensive Transitions (Limited from this defensive position)
- [[Slam Counter]] → [[Impact Escape]] (Success Rate: Beginner 10%, Intermediate 15%, Advanced 20%)
  *Note: Illegal in most competitions, self-defense application only*

## Counter Transitions
- [[Re-establish Posture]] → [[Triangle Escape Position]] (against tightening attempts)
- [[Emergency Tap]] → Match conceded (when escape becomes impossible and submission imminent)

## Expert Insights
- **Danaher System**: Approaches triangle escape as a hierarchical defensive system where posture and pressure must be established before any arm extraction or escape attempt. Emphasizes that most triangle escape failures occur because practitioners attempt to extract trapped arm before establishing sufficient posture and relieving primary choking pressure. Systematizes escape into distinct phases: emergency breathing space creation, posture establishment, hip control, angle prevention, space progressive creation, and only then arm extraction and final escape. Treats prevention as far superior to cure, teaching detailed triangle defense principles that prevent triangle establishment rather than relying on escapes from completed triangles.
- **Gordon Ryan**: Views triangle escape through realistic competition lens where a fully locked triangle with proper angle is nearly impossible to escape against skilled opponent, emphasizing the critical importance of early defensive intervention before triangle is fully secured. Focuses on aggressive posture maintenance and "making the position expensive" by forcing opponent to work continuously to maintain and tighten position, creating fatigue and technical errors that enable escape opportunities. Notes that in high-level competition, preventing the triangle lock from completing (especially stopping the leg cross and angle creation) matters far more than having sophisticated escape techniques from fully established triangles.
- **Eddie Bravo**: Has extensive triangle attack and defense experience through 10th Planet's emphasis on submission-oriented grappling. When teaching triangle defense, emphasizes the importance of staying calm under submission pressure and methodically working through defensive sequences rather than panicking and exhausting energy through explosive failed attempts. Advocates for understanding that triangle defense often creates opportunities for opponent to transition to other attacks (armbars, omoplatas), requiring awareness of these transitions and defensive responses beyond pure triangle escape focus.

## Common Errors
- **Attempting to pull trapped arm out immediately** → Tightens triangle and accelerates submission
- **Poor posture allowing opponent to create optimal angle** → Dramatically reduces escape probability
- **Explosive movements creating positional instability** → Burns energy while potentially worsening position
- **Neglecting hip control allowing opponent to angle freely** → Permits opponent to optimize choking mechanics
- **Failing to create breathing space before attempting full escape** → Risk of passing out before completing escape
- **Focusing on wrong leg (far leg instead of near leg on neck)** → Ineffective pressure application missing primary threat
- **Stalling without progressive escape work** → Allows opponent to refine position and complete submission

## Training Drills
- **Positional Survival Training** - Extended rounds starting in fully locked triangle with focus purely on maintaining breathing space and posture, building ability to stay calm and survive under submission pressure without panicking
- **Progressive Escape Drilling** - Partner applies triangle with increasing tightness from 30% to 80% as escape techniques are practiced, developing proper mechanics before facing full submission threat
- **Stack Escape Repetitions** - High volume repetitions of stacking escape mechanics focusing on posture, weight distribution, and hip control, building automatic defensive responses
- **Arm Extraction Practice** - Isolated drilling of trapped arm removal techniques with partner maintaining realistic leg configuration but reduced choking pressure, developing precise extraction mechanics
- **Early Defense Training** - Practice identifying triangle setup stages and implementing defensive measures before lock completion, developing prevention skills superior to escape techniques
- **Scenario-Based Defense** - Partner applies various triangle configurations (arm-in, no-arm, mounted triangle, etc.) requiring appropriate escape variation selection

## Related Positions
- [[Triangle Control]] - Opponent's attacking position when holding triangle choke
- [[Closed Guard Bottom]] - Common position from which triangles are initiated
- [[Armbar Control]] - Alternative submission opponent may transition to if triangle escape begins
- [[Omoplata Control]] - Another attack option available to opponent during triangle defense
- [[Guard Top Position]] - Destination position when triangle escape is successful

## Decision Tree

**If** triangle is not yet fully locked (early stage):
- Execute immediate [[Posture Up]] and [[Prevent Leg Cross]] (Probability: 70%)
- Prioritize prevention over escape from worse position

**Else if** triangle locked but angle not yet optimized:
- Establish [[Strong Posture]] and [[Hip Control]] to prevent angle creation (Probability: 55%)
- Use [[Stack Pressure]] to neutralize leverage advantages (Probability: 50%)

**Else if** choking pressure intense requiring immediate action:
- Create emergency [[Breathing Space]] through leg push or posture drive (Probability: 40%)
- Then work [[Systematic Escape]] sequence starting with pressure relief (Probability: 35%)

**Else if** trapped arm position allows adjustment:
- Execute [[Hitchhiker Escape]] by hiding elbow and rotating (Probability: 45%)
- Or attempt [[Leg Push Escape]] after establishing posture (Probability: 40%)

**Else** (fully locked triangle with optimal angle):
- Recognize serious danger and work [[Emergency Defense]] (Probability: 25%)
- May need to accept [[Tap]] to avoid injury or unconsciousness

## Position Metrics
- Success Rate: 30% escape from fully locked triangle (competition data)
- Success Rate: 60% prevention before full lock (early defense)
- Average Time in Position: 15-45 seconds before tap or escape
- Submission Risk: 70% if triangle fully locked with proper angle
- Escape Probability: Decreases 10% per 10 seconds as opponent refines position
- Position Loss Probability: 60% (tap) vs 40% (escape)

## Optimal Escape Paths

**Fastest path to safety** (early intervention):
[[Triangle Setup Detected]] → [[Immediate Posture Defense]] → [[Prevent Leg Cross]] → [[Guard Top Position]]
*Reasoning: Prevention far easier than escape, stopping triangle before lock completion provides highest success rates*

**High-percentage escape** (systematic):
[[Triangle Escape Position]] → [[Stack and Posture]] → [[Hip Control]] → [[Create Space]] → [[Arm Extraction]] → [[Guard Passing Position]]
*Reasoning: Methodical approach addressing each defensive priority in sequence maximizes escape probability from bad position*

**Alternative emergency escape** (when stacking fails):
[[Triangle Escape Position]] → [[Hitchhiker Escape]] → [[Elbow Hide]] → [[Body Rotation]] → [[Side Control Top]]
*Reasoning: Alternative mechanism when conventional stacking is defended, uses trapped arm positioning differently*

**Last resort option** (competition context):
[[Triangle Escape Position]] → [[Survival Maintenance]] → [[Wait for Opponent Error]] → [[Capitalize on Space]] → [[Quick Escape]]
*Reasoning: When immediate escape appears impossible, maintaining survival position while waiting for opponent's technical error or fatigue*
