# Honey Hole Position Top
#bjj #state #leg-entanglement #top #advanced

## State Properties
- **State ID**: S245
- **Point Value**: 2 (Advantage position)
- **Position Type**: Offensive
- **Risk Level**: Medium
- **Energy Cost**: Medium
- **Time Sustainability**: Medium

## State Description
Honey Hole Position Top, also known as Inside Sankaku or 411 position, is an advanced leg entanglement where the top player traps one of opponent's legs between their own legs while facing their opponent. This position is highly offensive, providing direct access to heel hooks, kneebars, and toe holds while limiting opponent's escape options. The position creates a powerful control system through hip pressure and leg configuration, making it one of the most dangerous positions in modern no-gi BJJ.

The Honey Hole represents the culmination of modern leg lock development, pioneered by John Danaher and his students. From this position, the top player maintains significant control advantages while threatening multiple submission paths. The position is characterized by the specific leg entanglement where one leg triangles around opponent's trapped leg while the other leg crosses over their hip, creating a figure-four configuration that isolates the leg for attack.

This position excels in no-gi grappling and submission-only rulesets where leg attacks are permitted. It requires careful control and technical precision to maintain while setting up submissions. The risk level is medium because improper execution can result in counter-entanglements or leg lock exposure for the attacker.

## Visual Description
You are positioned perpendicular to your opponent, with your body forming a "T" shape relative to theirs. Your inside leg (closest to their body) weaves under their trapped leg and triangles back, hooking your outside ankle to create a figure-four configuration around their thigh. Your outside leg crosses over their hip, pinning them to the mat and preventing rotation. Your hips are elevated slightly off the mat, creating downward pressure on their trapped leg while your upper body leans back, establishing control with your hands gripping their trapped ankle or controlling their upper body. Your head is positioned away from their free leg to avoid kicks, while your entire body alignment creates a mechanical advantage for heel hook and kneebar attacks. The entanglement completely isolates one of their legs, limiting their mobility to only upper body movements and their free leg, which has minimal defensive utility from this angle. This configuration allows you to control distance, prevent escapes, and progressively break down their leg defenses while maintaining superior position.

## Key Principles
- **Leg Configuration Control**: Maintain proper figure-four entanglement with inside leg triangling and outside leg crossing hip
- **Hip Pressure**: Apply constant downward hip pressure to pin opponent and prevent rotation
- **Distance Management**: Control space between bodies to facilitate submissions while preventing counter-attacks
- **Upper Body Control**: Secure opponent's upper body with grips or frames to limit defensive reactions
- **Submission Progression**: Build attacks systematically from control to breaking mechanics to finish
- **Escape Prevention**: Anticipate common escape attempts (hip rotation, leg extraction) and maintain control adjustments

## Prerequisites
- Understanding of leg entanglement hierarchy
- Heel hook mechanics and safety protocols
- Hip mobility for maintaining entangled position
- Grip strength for controlling opponent's leg

## State Invariants
- One opponent leg trapped in figure-four configuration between your legs
- Your outside leg crosses over opponent's hip
- Perpendicular body alignment (T-shape relative to opponent)
- Hip elevation maintained for pressure

## Expert Insights
- **John Danaher**: "The Honey Hole is the crown jewel of leg entanglement systems. Your primary focus must be on controlling the distance and maintaining the proper leg configuration—inside leg creates the triangle, outside leg controls the hip. The submission is merely the natural consequence of proper positional control. Most practitioners rush to the finish without establishing the fundamental control elements, which leads to escapes and lost opportunities. Build control methodically, eliminate space, then apply breaking mechanics progressively."

- **Gordon Ryan**: "This is my highest percentage finishing position in competition. The key is recognizing when to enter and having the confidence to hold the position under pressure. I look for this entry from almost every guard position—X-guard, single leg X, even failed guard passes. Once I secure the entanglement, I focus on hip pressure first, then hand position on their heel. The outside heel hook is my primary finish, but threatening the inside heel hook or kneebar forces reactions that open the outside finish."

- **Eddie Bravo**: "While the Honey Hole comes from the modern leg lock game, it fits perfectly with 10th Planet principles of control before submission. From this position, I teach students to think in layers—first layer is leg entanglement, second layer is hip control, third layer is upper body control, then submission. If you skip layers, you'll get countered by experienced grapplers. The position also connects beautifully to the truck and twister system if opponent manages to turn away—just follow their rotation and you're in position for back attacks."

## Common Errors
- **Error**: Insufficient hip control
  - **Consequence**: Allows opponent to escape by creating space and removing their leg from entanglement.
  - **Correction**: Keep your hips tight to opponent's hip, using your legs to clamp their trapped leg while maintaining constant pressure to eliminate escape routes.
  - **Recognition**: If you feel opponent's leg slipping or they're creating distance between hips, your hip control is inadequate.

- **Error**: Over-rotating too early
  - **Consequence**: Telegraphs the submission and gives opponent time to defend or counter-rotate.
  - **Correction**: Build control incrementally—secure leg entanglement first, establish hip connection, then rotate deliberately with full control of opponent's leg.
  - **Recognition**: If opponent easily blocks your rotation or counters, you've likely rotated before establishing sufficient control.

- **Error**: Neglecting upper body control
  - **Consequence**: Opponent can use frames or grips to prevent rotation or create defensive posture.
  - **Correction**: Control opponent's upper body with overhooks, underhooks, or wrist control to limit their defensive options while setting up leg attacks.
  - **Recognition**: If opponent successfully frames against your chest or blocks your movements with their hands, you need better upper body control.

- **Error**: Incorrect leg configuration
  - **Consequence**: Weakens entanglement and allows opponent to escape or counter.
  - **Correction**: Ensure your outside leg crosses over opponent's hip while inside leg triangles around their trapped leg—this creates maximum control and submission leverage.
  - **Recognition**: If your legs feel loose or opponent can move their trapped leg significantly, your configuration is incorrect.

- **Error**: Applying submission before control
  - **Consequence**: Results in lost position as opponent escapes during premature submission attempt.
  - **Correction**: Establish complete positional control first—secure entanglement, eliminate space, control hips—then apply submission slowly and progressively.
  - **Recognition**: If opponent escapes as you attempt submission, you rushed the finish before securing position.

- **Error**: Ignoring opponent's free leg
  - **Consequence**: Opponent can use their free leg to create frames, push off, or even strike in MMA contexts.
  - **Correction**: Position your head and upper body away from their free leg's range while monitoring its position; use your outside leg's positioning to limit their free leg's effectiveness.
  - **Recognition**: If opponent's free leg interferes with your control or attacks, you haven't properly neutralized it.

- **Error**: Static positioning without adjustment
  - **Consequence**: Allows opponent to build escape momentum and eventually break free.
  - **Correction**: Continuously make micro-adjustments based on opponent's movements—tighten legs when they push, shift hips when they rotate, adjust grips based on their hand fighting.
  - **Recognition**: If opponent progressively improves their position despite your control, you're being too static.

## Training Drills
- **Entanglement Retention Drill**: Partner starts in honey hole, you maintain position while they use 50% resistance to attempt escapes. Focus on hip pressure, leg configuration, and making constant adjustments. Start with 30-second rounds, progress to 2-minute rounds as control improves. Partner should attempt all standard escapes: hip rotation, leg extraction, inside position reversal.

- **Entry to Control Progression**: Start from various guard positions (X-guard, single leg X, ashi garami) and practice entering honey hole with proper leg configuration and hip control. Do 10 repetitions from each starting position, focusing on smooth transitions and immediate control establishment. Partner offers 25% resistance initially, increasing to 75% as technique improves.

- **Submission Chain Drill**: From established honey hole, flow between outside heel hook, inside heel hook, kneebar, and toe hold without releasing position. Practice transitioning between submissions based on opponent's defensive reactions. 5-minute rounds focusing on maintaining control while threatening multiple attacks. This builds submission awareness and control endurance.

- **Live Positional Sparring**: Start in honey hole position and roll with progressive resistance—first 5 minutes at 50%, next 5 minutes at 75%, final 5 minutes at 100%. Top player works to maintain and submit, bottom player works to escape. Reset to starting position after escape or submission. Track success rates to measure improvement.

- **Entry Timing Drill**: Partner plays open guard or engages in scrambles, you look for honey hole entry opportunities. Focus on recognizing when opponent's leg is vulnerable for entanglement—during guard passes, after failed sweeps, during transitions. Emphasize timing and quick entry rather than forcing position.
