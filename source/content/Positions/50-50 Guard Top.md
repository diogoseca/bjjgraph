  # Common Questions (Q&A Patterns for LLM/Chatbot)
  common_questions:
    - q: "When should I attack heel hook vs kneebar from 50-50 top?"
      a: "Attack heel hook when you have clean access to the heel and strong inside control. Transition to kneebar if opponent successfully defends the heel or hides it away. The kneebar often opens when opponent focuses all defense on protecting the heel."
      context: "decision_making"
      skill_level: "intermediate"

    - q: "How do I prevent position reversal in 50-50?"
      a: "Prevent reversal by maintaining constant hip pressure, keeping inside position with your legs, and controlling opponent's heel. Never let your weight come off them, and fight hard for inside control if they attempt to match your position."
      context: "defensive"
      skill_level: "intermediate"

    - q: "What if my opponent is defending everything?"
      a: "If opponent is defending all leg attacks, transition to back take by releasing the leg entanglement and taking the back as they focus on leg defense. Alternatively, clear the legs and pass to side control for dominant position."
      context: "adaptation"
      skill_level: "advanced"

    - q: "How fast should I move in 50-50 scrambles?"
      a: "Move with controlled urgency - fast enough to secure advantageous grips and position before opponent equalizes, but controlled enough to maintain balance and not give up inside position. Speed without control leads to reversals."
      context: "technical"
      skill_level: "intermediate"

    - q: "Should I stay in 50-50 or try to pass?"
      a: "If you have strong inside control and submission experience, stay and attack. If opponent is matching your position or you're uncertain about leg locks, clear the legs and pass to side control for safer dominant position."
      context: "strategic"
      skill_level: "beginner"

  # Coaching Cues (Natural Language for Instruction)

  # Dilemma Structures (Craig Jones Philosophy)
  dilemmas:
    - scenario: "Opponent defends heel hook"
      dilemma_created: "Defending heel by hiding it exposes knee to kneebar and creates back take opportunity"
      offensive_options:
        - "Kneebar → Won by Submission (Success: 55%)"
        - "Back Take → Back Control Top (Success: 70%)"
      narrative: "As your opponent focuses all attention on protecting their heel, their knee becomes vulnerable and their back begins to expose. Your heel hook threat has created two new attacks."

    - scenario: "Opponent attempts leg extraction"
      dilemma_created: "Extracting leg requires creating space which allows pass or back exposure"
      offensive_options:
        - "Leg Drag Pass → Side Control Top (Success: 70%)"
        - "Back Take → Back Control Top (Success: 65%)"
      narrative: "Your opponent's attempt to escape the leg entanglement creates the space you need to either pass their guard or take their back."

    - scenario: "Opponent equalizes position"
      dilemma_created: "Matching your inside position requires shifting weight which creates submission openings"
      offensive_options:
        - "Heel Hook → Won by Submission (Success: 60%)"
        - "Ankle Lock → Won by Submission (Success: 50%)"
      narrative: "As your opponent shifts their weight to match your inside control, their leg structure becomes vulnerable to quick submission attacks."

  # Narrative Generation Prompts
  narrative_prompts:
    entry: "The legs tangle and twist as both fighters scramble. You secure top position in the 50-50, your hips heavy on your opponent."
    control: "From top 50-50, you maintain pressure and control. Your opponent's leg is trapped, their heel within reach. The submission opportunities are everywhere."
    attack_initiation: "You secure the heel with both hands. Your opponent's eyes widen - they know what's coming. The heel hook is there."
    success: "The tap comes quick and clear. Your heel hook was inevitable from the moment you controlled the heel. Perfect execution from 50-50 top."
    failure: "Your opponent defends the heel expertly, hiding it away. No matter - the kneebar is there instead, or perhaps the back. The position gifts you options."
    position_loss: "Your opponent matches your inside control and begins reversing the position. Time to extract and pass, or accept the reversal and defend."

  # Knowledge Assessment Questions
  knowledge_questions:
    - question: "What are the three primary submissions from 50-50 Guard Top?"
      answer: "Heel hook (primary), kneebar (alternative), and ankle lock/toe hold (quick opportunistic). Additionally, calf slicer is available in some positions. The key is chaining between them based on opponent's defense."

      points: 10

    - question: "What is inside position control and why is it critical?"
      answer: "Inside position means your leg is inside your opponent's leg structure, closer to their centerline. This is critical because inside control allows you to attack their leg while preventing them from attacking yours. It's the dominant position in any leg entanglement."

    - question: "When opponent defends your heel hook, what is the highest percentage transition?"
      answer: "Back take is the highest percentage transition (70% at advanced level). When opponent focuses on defending their heel, their back becomes exposed. Alternative is kneebar (55% success) if the knee is accessible."

    - question: "How does leg lock experience level affect this position?"
      answer: "Against less experienced opponents, submission success increases significantly (+10-15% modifier) because they defend poorly and panic. Against experienced leg lockers, position becomes more neutral and transitions to passing or back take become more important."

    - question: "What are the two key factors for maintaining top position in 50-50?"
      answer: "Hip pressure (keeping your weight heavy on opponent to prevent them coming up) and inside position control (keeping your leg inside theirs). Without both, opponent can reverse position or escape. These work together to create the top advantage."

## State Description

50-50 Guard Top is a neutral leg entanglement position where both practitioners have their legs entwined in a mirror configuration, with you achieving top position through superior hip pressure and inside control. Despite being scored as neutral (0 points) in most rulesets, the top position provides significant advantages for leg lock attacks and transitions to dominant positions. The position is named "50-50" because both fighters theoretically have equal access to each other's legs, though top position breaks this parity.

From this position, you have multiple high-percentage submission opportunities, primarily the heel hook, along with alternative attacks including kneebar, ankle lock, and calf slicer. The top position also enables strong transitions to back control or passing to side control when submissions are defended. The leg entanglement creates a complex tactical situation where inside position control, grip fighting, and submission chains determine success.

The 50-50 Guard Top is particularly effective in no-gi competition where heel hooks are legal, and against opponents with limited leg lock experience. However, it carries significant risk as the position can quickly reverse, and both practitioners are vulnerable to leg attacks. Energy management is important as maintaining grip control and hip pressure over time requires sustained effort.

## Visual Description

You are positioned on top with your right leg triangled around your opponent's right leg, your shin across their thigh and your foot hooking behind their knee. Your left leg is positioned alongside their left leg, maintaining inside control with your calf or shin. Your hips are heavy, pressing down on your opponent to keep them flat on their back. Your upper body is leaning forward over your opponent, creating downward pressure that prevents them from sitting up or escaping. Both your hands are controlling your opponent's right heel or foot, with strong grips that prevent extraction.

Your opponent is on their back with their right leg trapped in your triangle configuration. Their left leg is entangled with yours, creating a mirror image of leg positioning. They are trying to match your inside control, fight your grips, or create space to escape. The leg entanglement creates a complex knot where both fighters' legs are intertwined.

Key pressure points include your hip weight pressing down on opponent's hips (preventing upward movement and escape), your right shin across their thigh (controlling leg angle and creating triangle structure), and your hands on their heel (enabling submissions and preventing leg extraction). Your inside position with the left leg prevents them from achieving equal control.

This creates offensive advantages through multiple submission attacks and transition opportunities while maintaining defensive security through top position, though the position requires active control to prevent reversal.

## Key Principles

- **Inside Position Dominance**: Maintaining inside control with your left leg is critical for all offensive opportunities and prevents opponent from attacking your legs effectively
- **Hip Pressure Application**: Constant downward hip pressure keeps opponent flat and prevents them from sitting up to equalize position or escape
- **Heel Control Priority**: Controlling opponent's heel with strong grips enables heel hook finish and prevents them from extracting their leg
- **Submission Chain Mentality**: Success requires chaining between heel hook, kneebar, ankle lock, and back take based on opponent's defensive reactions
- **Energy Management**: Position demands sustained grip strength and hip pressure, requiring efficient energy use to maintain control over time
- **Risk Awareness**: Position can reverse quickly if opponent matches inside control, requiring constant awareness of position parity

## Offensive Transitions

From this position, you can execute:

### Submissions

- [[Heel Hook]] → [[Won by Submission]] (Success Rate: Beginner 30%, Intermediate 45%, Advanced 65%)
  - Primary submission from top 50-50; control heel and apply rotational pressure

- [[Kneebar from 50-50]] → [[Won by Submission]] (Success Rate: Beginner 25%, Intermediate 40%, Advanced 55%)
  - Alternative when heel is defended; attack knee joint with leg extension

- [[Ankle Lock]] → [[Won by Submission]] (Success Rate: Beginner 35%, Intermediate 50%, Advanced 65%)
  - Quick foot lock when opponent defends other attacks

- [[Calf Slicer]] → [[Won by Submission]] (Success Rate: Beginner 20%, Intermediate 35%, Advanced 50%)
  - Compression lock on calf muscle when opponent crosses legs defensively

### Position Improvements

- [[Back Take from 50-50]] → [[Back Control Top]] (Success Rate: Beginner 35%, Intermediate 50%, Advanced 70%)
  - Highest percentage transition when opponent defends legs; release entanglement and take back

- [[Leg Drag Pass]] → [[Side Control Top]] (Success Rate: Beginner 40%, Intermediate 55%, Advanced 70%)
  - Clear leg entanglement and pass to dominant top position

## Defensive Responses

When opponent has this position against you, available counters:

- [[50-50 Escape to Standing]] → [[Neutral Standing]] (Success Rate: 45%)
  - Extract legs carefully and return to standing position

- [[Counter Heel Hook]] → [[50-50 Guard Bottom]] (Success Rate: 40%)
  - Opponent attacks your leg with their own heel hook threat

- [[Leg Entanglement Reversal]] → [[50-50 Guard Bottom]] (Success Rate: 35%)
  - Match inside position and use technique to reverse top/bottom positions

- [[Toe Hold Defense]] → [[50-50 Guard Top Maintained]] (Success Rate: 50%)
  - Defend opponent's submission attempt while maintaining top advantage

## Decision Tree

**If** opponent's leg is exposed and heel accessible:
- Execute [[Heel Hook]] → [[Won by Submission]] (Probability: 65%)
  - Reasoning: Heel hook is primary finish from top 50-50 position
- Or Execute [[Kneebar]] → [[Won by Submission]] (Probability: 55%)
  - Reasoning: Alternative leg lock when heel hook is defended

**Else if** opponent is defending legs actively:
- Execute [[Back Take Transition]] → [[Back Control Top]] (Probability: 70%)
  - Reasoning: Defensive focus on legs opens back exposure
- Or Execute [[Leg Drag Pass]] → [[Side Control Top]] (Probability: 55%)
  - Reasoning: Clear entanglement for safer dominant position

**Else if** opponent is equalizing position (matching inside control):
- Execute [[Ankle Lock]] → [[Won by Submission]] (Probability: 50%)
  - Reasoning: Quick submission before position fully reverses
- Or Execute [[Leg Extraction]] → [[Neutral Standing]] (Probability: 45%)
  - Reasoning: Reset to neutral rather than risk complete reversal

**Else** (maintaining control without immediate finish):
- Maintain position and setup → [[50-50 Guard Top]] (Probability: 60%)
  - Reasoning: Control position while creating submission opening through grip fighting and pressure

## Expert Insights

**John Danaher**: "The 50-50 position represents the ultimate expression of modern leg lock theory. The name suggests equality, but top position creates decisive advantage through hip pressure and inside control. Your primary objective is heel hook submission, but the position's true power lies in the submission chain - heel hook to kneebar to back take. Each defensive response opens the next attack. The key technical detail is inside position on the non-triangled leg; this single element determines who controls the exchange. In training, develop the ability to recognize inside position instantly and fight for it with the same intensity you would fight for dominant position in positional grappling. The practitioner who controls inside position controls the outcome."

**Gordon Ryan**: "I've finished dozens of high-level opponents from 50-50 top. Here's what works in competition: get inside position first, control the heel second, finish third. Most people rush to the heel and lose inside control - that's when the position reverses. In competition, I use 50-50 primarily as an entry to other positions. If I have a clean heel hook, I finish it fast. If not, I take the back or pass. Time management is critical - don't spend three minutes in 50-50 trading grip fights. Get your attack or get out. The back take from 50-50 when they defend the heel is one of the highest percentage moves in no-gi grappling. Your training partners will defend your heel hook in the room; learn to take their back when they do."

**Eddie Bravo**: "50-50 gets a bad reputation as a stalling position, but that's because people don't understand the attacks. From top 50-50, you've got heel hooks, kneebars, toe holds, calf slicers, ankle locks, and back takes. If you're stalling, you're doing it wrong. The key is the grip fight - you need control of that heel before anything works. I teach my students to enter 50-50 with a plan: heel hook first, but have your backup ready. If they defend, don't stubbornly chase the same attack. Flow to kneebar, flow to back take. The position rewards creativity and submission chains. Also, 50-50 is excellent for the smaller grappler because it neutralizes size advantage - leg entanglements don't care how big you are."

## Common Errors

### Error: Abandoning Inside Position Control
- **Consequence**: Losing inside position allows opponent to equalize the entanglement and potentially reverse to top position themselves. Without inside control, your submission success rate drops dramatically and you become vulnerable to opponent's leg attacks.
- **Correction**: Fight constantly for inside position with your left leg. Keep your shin or calf pressed inside opponent's leg structure. If you feel them gaining inside control, immediately address it by redirecting your leg positioning before pursuing submissions.
- **Recognition**: If opponent's leg feels like it's gaining inside angle on yours, or if their hip position is starting to match yours, you're losing inside control. Stop your current attack and recover inside position first.

### Error: Insufficient Hip Pressure
- **Consequence**: Without constant downward hip pressure, opponent can sit up, create space, extract their leg, or reverse the position. Light hips allow opponent to equalize and potentially gain top position.
- **Correction**: Keep your hips heavy and driving downward at all times. Even when attacking submissions, maintain hip weight on opponent. Think of your hips as an anchor preventing their escape.
- **Recognition**: If opponent is able to sit up partially or create space underneath them, your hip pressure is insufficient. Reset by driving hips down and forward before continuing attacks.

### Error: Weak Heel Control Grips
- **Consequence**: Weak grips allow opponent to extract their heel, defend heel hook, or pull their leg free from the entanglement. Poor grip control is the primary reason heel hooks fail from 50-50.
- **Correction**: Establish strong two-handed control on opponent's heel before attempting finish. Your grips should be tight enough that opponent cannot pull heel away despite maximum effort. Grips are your connection to the submission.
- **Recognition**: If opponent is able to rotate heel away from you or pull their foot free, your grips are inadequate. Pause submission attempt, reset grips with maximum tightness, then continue.

### Error: Pursuing Single Attack Too Long
- **Consequence**: Stubbornly chasing one submission (usually heel hook) allows opponent to adapt their defense and potentially create escape opportunities. Also wastes energy on defended attacks.
- **Correction**: If heel hook is defended after 2-3 serious attempts, immediately chain to alternative attacks: kneebar, ankle lock, or back take. Keep opponent defending multiple threats rather than perfecting defense of one.
- **Recognition**: If you've attempted the same submission three times and opponent is defending successfully, you're overly committed. Switch attacks immediately.

### Error: Neglecting Energy Management
- **Consequence**: 50-50 position requires sustained grip strength and hip pressure over time. Fatigued grips cannot control heel effectively, and tired hips cannot prevent escape or reversal.
- **Correction**: Be strategic about when to apply maximum pressure and when to conserve. Maintain controlling pressure constantly but save explosive effort for submission finishes. Consider passing or taking back if position extends beyond 90 seconds without clear advantage.
- **Recognition**: If your forearms are burning and grips are weakening, or if maintaining hip pressure feels difficult, your energy is depleting. Make a decision: finish quickly, transition to less demanding position, or extract.

### Error: Ignoring Position Reversal Threat
- **Consequence**: Failing to recognize when opponent is matching your inside control and achieving position parity leads to unexpected reversals. Suddenly you're on bottom defending same attacks you were just attempting.
- **Correction**: Constantly monitor opponent's inside position attempts. If they're close to matching your control, address it immediately by increasing hip pressure, fighting for inside angle, or extracting from position entirely. Don't wait until reversal is complete.
- **Recognition**: If you feel opponent's leg achieving similar inside angle to yours, or if their hip position is rising to match yours, position reversal is imminent. Act immediately to prevent or accept reversal and defend.

### Error: Poor Transition Timing
- **Consequence**: Attempting transitions to back take or pass at wrong moment allows opponent to defend easily or reverse. Timing of exits from 50-50 is critical for success.
- **Correction**: Transition to back take when opponent is heavily focused on defending their heel (creates back exposure). Transition to pass when opponent is actively trying to extract legs (creates passing opportunity). Time transitions to opponent's actions.
- **Recognition**: If transition attempts are easily defended, timing is wrong. Wait for opponent's defensive commitment before transitioning.

## Training Drills

### Drill 1: Inside Position Battle - Control Fundamentals
Start in 50-50 entanglement with partner, both seeking inside position on the free leg. Practice fighting for inside control without submissions, focusing purely on leg positioning angles and hip pressure. Begin at 0% resistance (partner allows you inside position), progress to 25% (mild resistance), 50% (active competition), 75% (intense battle), and 100% (full competition). Sets: 3 minutes per round, 3 rounds with 1 minute rest. Focus on feeling when you have inside control vs when opponent is gaining it. Common mistake: focusing on upper body instead of hip and leg angles.

### Drill 2: Top Position Maintenance - Pressure and Control
Partner starts in bottom 50-50 and attempts to reverse position to top while you work to maintain top position using hip pressure and inside control. No submissions allowed - pure positional control. Begin at 25% resistance (partner makes slow escape attempts), progress to 50% (realistic escape efforts), 75% (intense reversal attempts), 100% (full competition). 5 rounds of 2 minutes each. Goal: maintain top position for entire round without reversal. Focus: constant hip pressure, inside control, and grip fighting. Partner should try different methods: hip escape, position matching, leg extraction.

### Drill 3: Submission Chain Flow - Heel Hook to Alternatives
Start in top 50-50 with good inside control. Attempt heel hook; partner defends by hiding heel. Immediately chain to kneebar; partner defends by pulling knee back. Immediately chain to back take or leg drag pass. Flow through entire sequence smoothly. Begin at 0% resistance (partner allows everything), progress through 25%, 50%, 75% resistance. Focus on smooth transitions between attacks without pause. 10 repetitions per round, 3 rounds. Goal: make transitions automatic so defenses create immediate alternative attacks. Common mistake: pausing between attacks instead of flowing continuously.

### Drill 4: Entry and Establishment - Scramble to Top 50-50
Start standing or from failed guard pull/takedown. Enter leg entanglement (start with simple entries), scramble for top position with inside control. Partner provides progressive resistance. Begin at 25% (partner allows position establishment), increase to 50% (partner actively competes for top position), 75% (intense scramble), 100% (full competition). 5 rounds of 2 minutes, emphasizing quick inside control establishment and hip pressure application. Focus: winning the scramble phase where 50-50 is established. This is where position advantage is often determined.

### Drill 5: Live Positional Sparring - Full 50-50 Game
Start in established 50-50 entanglement with partner. You start on top with inside control. Full live sparring with submissions allowed. Reset when submission occurs, position is fully reversed, or someone extracts completely. 5-minute rounds with 2-minute rest, 4-5 rounds. Focus: combining all elements (inside control, hip pressure, submissions, chains, transitions). Partner provides 100% resistance and attempts reversals and submissions. Goal: maintain top position and finish or transition successfully at least 60% of the time.

## Optimal Submission Paths

**Fastest path to submission** (direct attack):
[[50-50 Guard Top]] → [[Heel Hook]] → [[Won by Submission]]
*Reasoning: Heel hook is primary submission with 65% advanced success rate when clean inside control and heel access exists. Fastest finish if setup is clean.*

**High-percentage path** (systematic chain):
[[50-50 Guard Top]] → [[Heel Hook Attempt]] → [[Opponent Defends]] → [[Kneebar]] → [[Won by Submission]]
*Reasoning: Chaining to kneebar after heel hook defense increases overall finish rate to ~80% combined. Opponent cannot defend both simultaneously.*

**Alternative submission path** (back take option):
[[50-50 Guard Top]] → [[Heel Hook Attempt]] → [[Opponent Defends Heavily]] → [[Back Take]] → [[Back Control Top]] → [[Rear Naked Choke]] → [[Won by Submission]]
*Reasoning: When opponent invests all defense in protecting legs, back becomes exposed. Back take is 70% success and leads to high-percentage finishes.*

**Positional dominance path** (safe progress):
[[50-50 Guard Top]] → [[Leg Drag Pass]] → [[Side Control Top]] → [[Mount]] → [[Armbar from Mount]] → [[Won by Submission]]
*Reasoning: Clearing legs and passing to side control removes risk of position reversal. From side control, traditional submission paths are available with lower technical risk.*

**Opportunistic path** (quick finish):
[[50-50 Guard Top]] → [[Ankle Lock]] → [[Won by Submission]]
*Reasoning: When opponent briefly exposes foot while fighting for position, quick ankle lock can finish before they establish defenses. Requires excellent timing but offers rapid finish.*

## Timing Considerations

**Best Times to Enter**:
- After failed takedown attempt creates leg entanglement during scramble
- When opponent pulls guard and legs become entangled in transition
- From single leg X guard when position transforms into 50-50 configuration

**Best Times to Attack**:
- Immediately after establishing top position before opponent equalizes inside control
- When opponent makes grip-fighting error exposing their heel
- After applying hip pressure for 5-10 seconds and feeling opponent flatten

**Vulnerable Moments**:
- When transitioning between submission attempts (brief loss of control)
- If grip strength is fading and heel control becomes compromised
- When opponent achieves equal inside position (position parity means reversal risk)

**Fatigue Factors**:
- Grip strength begins failing after 60-90 seconds of sustained heel control
- Hip pressure effectiveness decreases after 2+ minutes without rest
- Decision point: finish or extract should come within 90 seconds if possible

## Competition Considerations

**Point Scoring**: 50-50 position scores zero points in IBJJF and most rulesets. However, successful transition to back control (from 50-50) would score 4 points for back control. Leg drag pass to side control would score 3 points. Some rulesets may award advantages for deep submission attempts.

**Time Management**: In competition with time limits, avoid spending excessive time in 50-50 unless submission finish is imminent. If position extends beyond 90 seconds without clear advantage, consider extracting and passing or taking back for points. In no-time-limit matches, position sustainability is less critical.

**Rule Set Adaptations**:
- IBJJF Gi: Heel hooks illegal at all belts; only ankle locks, toe holds (brown/black), and kneebar allowed. 50-50 becomes more about position reversal and back takes.
- IBJJF No-Gi: Heel hooks legal at brown/black; position becomes submission-focused at higher belts.
- ADCC/Submission-only: All leg locks legal at all levels; 50-50 becomes high-risk high-reward position.
- Know your ruleset before entering 50-50 - illegal submissions change optimal strategy.

**Competition Strategy**: Use 50-50 top position as offensive weapon in no-gi matches where leg locks are legal. Against opponents with limited leg lock experience, position is highly effective. Against high-level leg lockers, treat 50-50 as transitional position to pass or take back rather than extended engagement. In gi competition without heel hooks, focus on back take and passing transitions rather than submissions.

## Historical Context

The 50-50 guard position gained prominence in modern BJJ competition in the late 2000s and early 2010s, particularly through the success of competitors like Rafa Mendes and Marcelo Garcia who used it as both offensive and defensive position. Initially controversial for perceived stalling potential, the position evolved as submission-based approaches (primarily from Eddie Cummings, Gordon Ryan, and the Danaher Death Squad) demonstrated its offensive potential through leg locks. The position name reflects the theoretically equal access both practitioners have to each other's legs, though top position breaks this parity. Today, 50-50 is recognized as a sophisticated position requiring deep understanding of inside control, leg entanglement theory, and submission chains.
