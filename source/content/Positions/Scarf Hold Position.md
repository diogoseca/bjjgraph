# Scarf Hold Position
#bjj #state #pin #control #kesa-gatame

## State Properties
- **State ID**: S242
- **Point Value**: 3 (Controlling pin position)
- **Position Type**: Offensive/Controlling
- **Risk Level**: Medium
- **Energy Cost**: Low to Medium
- **Time Sustainability**: Long

## State Description
Scarf Hold (Kesa Gatame) is a fundamental pinning position where the top practitioner controls the opponent from a perpendicular angle, trapping one arm while using their body weight to immobilize the opponent's upper body. This position is particularly effective for maintaining control with minimal energy expenditure and offers unique submission opportunities. The angular nature of this pin creates a different dynamic than traditional north-south or side control positions, limiting specific escape routes while opening others.

## Visual Description

From a top-down view, the practitioner sits beside the opponent's upper body at approximately a 90-degree angle, with their hip positioned next to the opponent's chest. The practitioner's near arm threads under the opponent's near arm, gripping their own thigh or gi for control, while the far arm wraps around the opponent's head and neck, pulling it tight to their chest. The practitioner's legs are splayed wide for base, with the near leg extended and the far leg bent, creating a stable triangular base. The opponent lies on their back with their near arm trapped and controlled, their head pulled up and away from the mat, restricting their ability to bridge or turn effectively. This perpendicular configuration creates exceptional chest and shoulder pressure on the opponent while allowing the top person to distribute weight efficiently through their hip and upper body, making the position highly sustainable with proper technique.

## Key Principles
- Maintain perpendicular angle to opponent's body
- Keep opponent's near arm controlled and isolated
- Pull opponent's head tight to your chest to prevent bridging
- Keep hips heavy and low against opponent's chest
- Maintain wide base with legs for stability
- Distribute weight through hips, not just upper body
- Control opponent's far arm to prevent framing

## Prerequisites
- Successful transition from side control or guard pass
- Control of opponent's near arm
- Opponent flat on back
- Proper angular positioning relative to opponent

## State Invariants
- Top practitioner perpendicular to opponent's body
- Opponent's near arm controlled and trapped
- Opponent's head pulled up and controlled
- Top practitioner's hip against opponent's chest
- Top practitioner seated or based beside opponent

## Defensive Responses (When Opponent Has This State)
- [[Bridge and Turn]] → [[Turtle Position]] or [[Guard Recovery]]
- [[Arm Extraction]] → [[Side Control Bottom]] or [[Half Guard Bottom]]
- [[Hip Escape]] → [[Guard Recovery]]
- [[Inside Arm Push]] → [[Scarf Hold Escape]]

## Offensive Transitions (Available From This State)
- [[Modified Scarf Hold]] → [[Modified Scarf Hold Position]]
- [[North-South Transition]] → [[North-South]]
- [[Triangle Setup]] → [[Triangle Control]]
- [[Americana from Scarf Hold]] → [[Won by Submission]]
- [[Armbar from Scarf Hold]] → [[Armbar Control]]
- [[Reverse Scarf Hold]] → [[Reverse Kesa Gatame]]

## Counter Transitions
- [[Re-establish Scarf Hold]] → [[Scarf Hold Position]] (against escape attempts)
- [[Transition to Mount]] → [[Mount]] (if opponent creates space)
- [[Transition to Side Control]] → [[Side Control]] (if angle is compromised)

## Expert Insights
- **Danaher System**: Emphasizes the importance of hip pressure and head control in scarf hold, viewing it as a transitional position rather than a final destination. Focuses on using the position to set up arm attacks and transitions to more dominant positions when opponent attempts to escape. The key is maintaining the angle and preventing opponent from turning into you.
- **Gordon Ryan**: Uses scarf hold primarily as a transitional position in no-gi grappling, recognizing its effectiveness but also its vulnerability to certain escapes. Emphasizes quick transitions to north-south or mount when opponent begins escape attempts, rather than trying to hold the position statically. Values the position more in gi where additional grips enhance control.
- **Eddie Bravo**: Incorporates scarf hold variations into his 10th Planet system, particularly when opponent attempts to turn away from side control or mount. Uses the position as a setup for arm triangles and back takes, viewing it as part of a flow rather than an isolated position. Emphasizes maintaining constant pressure and anticipating the opponent's defensive movements.

## Common Errors
- Opponent's near arm not adequately controlled → Easy arm extraction
- Head control too loose → Opponent can bridge and turn
- Hips too high → Reduced pressure and control
- Weight too far forward → Vulnerability to bridging escapes
- Base too narrow → Instability when opponent moves explosively
- Failing to control opponent's far arm → Opponent can create frames
- Static hold without pressure adjustment → Opponent escapes over time

## Training Drills
- Scarf hold maintenance against progressive resistance
- Transition drills from side control to scarf hold
- Submission sequences from scarf hold (Americana, arm triangle, armbar)
- Escape defense drills focusing on head control and arm isolation
- Flow drills between scarf hold, modified scarf hold, and north-south
- Pressure application and weight distribution practice

## Related States
- [[Modified Scarf Hold]] - Variation with different arm and head control
- [[Reverse Kesa Gatame]] - Reverse orientation scarf hold
- [[Side Control Top]] - Adjacent pinning position
- [[North-South Transition]] - Related pinning position
- [[Twister Control]] - Advanced variation with leg control

## Related Positions

- [[Side Control]] - Related position
- [[North-South]] - Related position
- [[Mount]] - Related position
- [[Triangle Control]] - Related position
- [[Turtle Position]] - Related position

## Decision Tree
If opponent attempts to extract near arm:
- Execute [[Americana from Scarf Hold]] or [[Armbar from Scarf Hold]]

Else if opponent bridges toward you:
- Execute [[Modified Scarf Hold]] to adjust angle and maintain control

Else if opponent turns away:
- Execute [[North-South Transition]] → [[North-South]]

Else (stable control established):
- Execute [[Triangle Setup]] or maintain position for control points

## Position Metrics
- Success Rate: 70% retention (varies by experience level)
- Average Time in Position: 1-3 minutes
- Submission Probability: 40%
- Positional Advancement Probability: 35% (to mount or north-south)
- Position Loss Probability: 30%

## Optimal Submission Paths
The shortest path to submission from this position:
[[Scarf Hold Position]] → [[Americana from Scarf Hold]] → [[Won by Submission]]

High-percentage path:
[[Scarf Hold Position]] → [[Triangle Setup]] → [[Triangle Control]] → [[Won by Submission]]

Alternative control-oriented path:
[[Scarf Hold Position]] → [[North-South Transition]] → [[North-South]] → [[Kimura]] → [[Won by Submission]]
