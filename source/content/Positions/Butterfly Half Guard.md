## State Properties
- **State ID**: S021
- **Point Value**: 0 (Neutral with offensive options)
- **Position Type**: Hybrid offensive guard
- **Risk Level**: Medium
- **Energy Cost**: Medium to High
- **Time Sustainability**: Medium

## State Description
Butterfly Half Guard is a powerful hybrid position that combines elements of both butterfly guard and half guard. The bottom player controls one of the opponent's legs in half guard while simultaneously inserting a butterfly hook under the opponent's other leg. This creates a versatile position with strong sweeping mechanics from the butterfly hook combined with the stability and control of half guard. The position offers exceptional offensive capabilities while maintaining reasonable defensive security.

## Key Principles
- Trap one of opponent's legs in half guard configuration
- Insert butterfly hook under opponent's free leg
- Establish upper body control through underhook or collar ties
- Maintain seated posture rather than lying flat
- Create and exploit leverage through active butterfly hook
- Control opponent's posture to prevent passing
- Generate elevation through coordinated leg drive and upper body pull

## Prerequisites
- Hip mobility and core strength
- Understanding of both butterfly and half guard mechanics
- Ability to maintain seated posture
- Familiarity with sweep mechanics and leverage points

## State Invariants
- One of opponent's legs trapped in half guard
- Butterfly hook inserted under opponent's free leg
- Upper body connection through grips or clinch
- Relative upright posture (not flat on back)
- Active hip movement and positioning

## Defensive Responses (When Opponent Has This State)
- [[Hook Removal and Pressure]] → [[Headquarters Position]]
- [[Crossface and Flatten]] → [[Flattened Half Guard]]
- [[Knee Slice Counter]] → [[Knee Cut Position]]
- [[Double Unders Pass]] → [[Double Unders Control]]
- [[Leg Weave Pass]] → [[Leg Drag Position]]

## Offensive Transitions (Available From This State)
- [[Butterfly Half Sweep]] → [[Top Position]]
- [[Modified Butterfly Sweep]] → [[Mount]]
- [[Transition to Full Butterfly]] → [[Butterfly Guard]]
- [[Hook Sweep to Back]] → [[Back Control]]
- [[Butterfly Half to X-Guard]] → [[X-Guard]]
- [[Butterfly Half to Single Leg X]] → [[Single Leg X Guard]]
- [[Overhead Sweep]] → [[Top Position]]
- [[John Wayne Sweep]] → [[Top Position]]

## Counter Transitions
- [[Re-establish Butterfly Half]] → [[Butterfly Half Guard]] (against pass attempts)
- [[Transition to Deep Half]] → [[Deep Half Guard]] (under pressure)
- [[Knee Shield Recovery]] → [[Knee Shield Half Guard]] (defensive option)

## Expert Insights
- **Danaher System**: Views butterfly half as a powerful hybrid position that offers strong sweeping mechanics with reduced risk compared to full butterfly. Emphasizes the mechanical principles of combining the elevation capabilities of the butterfly hook with the control aspects of the half guard, creating a position that amplifies the strengths of both while mitigating their weaknesses.
- **Gordon Ryan**: Utilizes butterfly half extensively, particularly as a transitional position within his bottom game system. Emphasizes the importance of upper body control and grip fighting to create advantageous angles for sweeping, and often connects butterfly half to leg entanglement entries.
- **Eddie Bravo**: Incorporates butterfly half principles into the 10th Planet system with unique configurations that connect to the lockdown and rubber guard systems. Emphasizes unorthodox control mechanisms and transition pathways not commonly seen in traditional BJJ.

## Common Errors
- Passive butterfly hook → Ineffective elevation
- Lying flat on back → Reduced sweeping leverage
- Poor upper body control → Vulnerability to passing
- Disconnected hook and half guard control → Fragmented position
- Overcommitment to single attacks → Predictable patterns

## Training Drills
- Butterfly half maintenance against increasing pressure
- Transition flows between butterfly half and related guards
- Sweep combinations with progressive resistance
- Upper body control and grip fighting sequences
- Recovery to butterfly half from defensive positions

## Related States
- [[Butterfly Guard]] - Full butterfly position with both hooks
- [[Half Guard Bottom]] - Traditional half guard without butterfly hook
- [[X-Guard]] - Advanced guard with similar elevation mechanics
- [[Single Leg X Guard]] - Related leg entanglement position
- [[Knee Shield Half Guard]] - Defensive half guard variation

## Decision Tree
If opponent stands with weight on trapped leg:
- Execute [[Butterfly Half Sweep]] or [[Hook Sweep to Back]]

Else if opponent drives forward with pressure:
- Execute [[Modified Butterfly Sweep]] or [[Overhead Sweep]]

Else if opponent attempts to free trapped leg:
- Execute [[Butterfly Half to X-Guard]] or [[Butterfly Half to Single Leg X]]

Else if opponent gives space:
- Execute [[Transition to Full Butterfly]] for more offensive options

## Position Metrics
- Success Rate: 65% offensive action (competition data)
- Average Time in Position: 20-45 seconds
- Sweep Probability: 60%
- Transition to Better Guard Probability: 25%
- Position Loss Probability: 25%

## Optimal Paths
Primary sweeping path:
[[Butterfly Half Guard]] → [[Butterfly Half Sweep]] → [[Top Position]] → [[Side Control]] → [[Mount]] → submission chain

Back-taking path:
[[Butterfly Half Guard]] → [[Hook Sweep to Back]] → [[Back Control]] → [[Rear Naked Choke]] → [[Won by Submission]]

Leg entanglement path:
[[Butterfly Half Guard]] → [[Butterfly Half to Single Leg X]] → [[Single Leg X Guard]] → [[Ashi Garami]] → [[Inside Heel Hook]] → [[Won by Submission]]

## Computer Science Analogy
Butterfly Half Guard represents an elegant composite data structure in the BJJ state graph, combining properties of two fundamental guard types to create a hybrid with enhanced capabilities. It implements principles of both butterfly and half guard, creating a position with the elevation mechanics of butterfly and the stability of half guard. This hybridization creates a state with advantageous properties of both parent states while mitigating their individual weaknesses, similar to how composite design patterns in software engineering combine objects to create structures with enhanced functionality.
