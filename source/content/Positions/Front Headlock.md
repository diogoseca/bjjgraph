## State Properties
- **State ID**: S025
- **Point Value**: 2 (Advantageous control position)
- **Position Type**: Control/submission setup position
- **Risk Level**: Low
- **Energy Cost**: Medium
- **Time Sustainability**: Medium to Long

## State Description
The Front Headlock is a powerful control position typically established from a frontal standing or kneeling position, where one practitioner controls their opponent's head and one arm. The controlling practitioner wraps one arm around the opponent's head and typically secures an underhook on the opponent's arm or establishes another form of upper body control. This position serves as both a powerful control mechanism and a launching point for numerous submissions, particularly chokes like the guillotine, anaconda, and d'arce, as well as takedowns and positional advancements.

## Key Principles
- Control opponent's head and at least one arm
- Maintain chest-to-head connection
- Establish proper head positioning to prevent escapes
- Create and manipulate angles to set up attacks
- Control opponent's posture and mobility
- Apply strategic pressure to force defensive reactions
- Maintain solid base to prevent counter-attacks

## Prerequisites
- Understanding of head and arm control mechanics
- Proper weight distribution and base
- Familiarity with choke mechanics
- Recognition of transitional opportunities

## State Invariants
- Control of opponent's head with one arm
- Control of at least one of opponent's arms
- Chest-to-head connection
- Elevated head position relative to opponent
- Opponent in defensive posture (typically hunched)

## Defensive Responses (When Opponent Has This State)
- [[Head Pop Escape]] → [[Neutral Standing]]
- [[Granby Roll]] → [[Guard Recovery]]
- [[Arm Drag Counter]] → [[Back Control]]
- [[Limp Arm and Base]] → [[Single Leg Entry]]
- [[Sprawl Counter]] → [[Turtle Position]]

## Offensive Transitions (Available From This State)
- [[Guillotine Control]] → [[Guillotine Choke]]
- [[Anaconda Entry]] → [[Anaconda Control]]
- [[D'arce Setup]] → [[D'arce Control]]
- [[Snap Down]] → [[Turtle Top]]
- [[Go Behind]] → [[Back Control]]
- [[Front Headlock to Mount]] → [[Mount]]
- [[Transition to North-South]] → [[North-South]]
- [[Japanese Necktie]] → [[Side Control]]
- [[Arm-in Guillotine]] → [[Mount]]

## Counter Transitions
- [[Re-establish Front Headlock]] → [[Front Headlock]] (against escapes)
- [[Switch to Back Control]] → [[Back Control]] (if opponent turns)
- [[Sprawl to Top Turtle]] → [[Turtle Top]] (if opponent shoots)

## Expert Insights
- **Danaher System**: Views the front headlock as a critical control position that creates a branching decision tree of submission and positional advancement options. Emphasizes precise mechanical control of the head and shoulders to prevent defensive movement before committing to specific submissions. Creates a systematic approach to choke selection based on the opponent's defensive reactions.
- **Gordon Ryan**: Uses the front headlock extensively in his no-gi system, focusing on creating seamless transitions between different choke variations to exploit defensive reactions. Emphasizes maintaining constant pressure while making subtle adjustments to head position and arm configuration based on the opponent's defensive posture.
- **Eddie Bravo**: Incorporates front headlock control as a key position in the 10th Planet system, often connecting it directly to specialized transitions like the Truck and Twister positions rather than traditional choke finishes. Emphasizes unorthodox control mechanisms and unique finishing sequences.

## Common Errors
- Insufficient head control → Easy escape opportunities
- Poor body positioning → Reduced leverage for attacks
- Telegraphing submission entries → Predictable patterns
- Neglecting base and posture → Vulnerability to counters
- Rushing submission attempts → Defensive opportunities

## Training Drills
- Front headlock control maintenance against increasing resistance
- Transitional flows between front headlock and related positions
- Submission entry sequences with progressive resistance
- Defensive recognition and counter drills
- Position recovery exercises when control is compromised

## Related States

- [[D'arce Control]] - Related submission control
- [[Anaconda Control]] - Related submission control
- [[Turtle Top]] - Related top control position
- [[Back Control]] - Common transition from front headlock

## Decision Tree
If opponent keeps head low and arm in:
- Execute [[Anaconda Entry]] or [[D'arce Setup]]

Else if opponent raises head while defending:
- Execute [[Guillotine Control]] or [[Snap Down]]

Else if opponent attempts to stand:
- Execute [[Go Behind]] or [[Snap Down]]

Else if opponent turns away:
- Execute [[Switch to Back Control]]

## Position Metrics
- Success Rate: 75% offensive advancement (competition data)
- Average Time in Position: 15-45 seconds
- Submission Probability: 40%
- Positional Advancement Probability: 65%
- Position Loss Probability: 15%

## Optimal Paths
Primary submission path:
[[Front Headlock]] → [[Guillotine Control]] → [[Guillotine Choke]] → [[Won by Submission]]

Back-taking path:
[[Front Headlock]] → [[Go Behind]] → [[Back Control]] → [[Rear Naked Choke]] → [[Won by Submission]]

Alternative submission path:
[[Front Headlock]] → [[D'arce Setup]] → [[D'arce Control]] → [[D'arce Choke]] → [[Won by Submission]]

## Computer Science Analogy
The Front Headlock represents a high-connectivity node in the BJJ state graph with multiple weighted edges to submission states and advantageous positions. It functions as a "gateway" control position with exceptional branching factor, where the controlling player can select from numerous high-probability paths based on the opponent's reactions. This creates a decision tree optimization problem where the player must select actions that maximize expected value while accounting for defensive responses.
