# Front Headlock
#bjj #state #control #takedown #submission

## State Properties
- **State ID**: S025
- **Point Value**: 2 (Advantageous control position)
- **Position Type**: Control/submission setup position
- **Risk Level**: Low
- **Energy Cost**: Medium
- **Time Sustainability**: Medium to Long

## State Description
The Front Headlock is a powerful control position typically established from a frontal standing or kneeling position, where one practitioner controls their opponent's head and one arm. The controlling practitioner wraps one arm around the opponent's head and typically secures an underhook on the opponent's arm or establishes another form of upper body control. This position serves as both a powerful control mechanism and a launching point for numerous submissions, particularly chokes like the guillotine, anaconda, and d'arce, as well as takedowns and positional advancements.

### Visual Description
You are in a frontal position, either standing or kneeling, facing your opponent who is typically in a lower stance, with their head bent forward. Your dominant arm is wrapped tightly around their head, encircling their neck with your bicep and forearm, pulling their face towards your chest or hip to maintain a strong chest-to-head connection that limits their ability to posture up. Your other arm often secures their near arm, either with an underhook or by controlling their wrist, preventing them from framing or attacking, while your legs are positioned with a wide base to maintain balance and resist counters. The opponent is hunched over, struggling to maintain posture under your control, with one arm potentially trapped and their head locked down, making them vulnerable to chokes, takedowns, or transitions to other dominant positions.

## Key Principles
- Control opponent's head and at least one arm
- Maintain chest-to-head connection
- Establish proper head positioning to prevent escapes
- Create and manipulate angles to set up attacks
- Control opponent's posture and mobility
- Apply strategic pressure to force defensive reactions
- Maintain solid base to prevent counter-attacks

## Prerequisites
- Understanding of head and arm control mechanics
- Proper weight distribution and base
- Familiarity with choke mechanics
- Recognition of transitional opportunities

## State Invariants
- Control of opponent's head with one arm
- Control of at least one of opponent's arms
- Chest-to-head connection
- Elevated head position relative to opponent
- Opponent in defensive posture (typically hunched)

- [[Japanese Necktie]] → [[Side Control]] (Success Rate: Beginner 25%, Intermediate 40%, Advanced 55%)
- [[Arm-in Guillotine]] → [[Mount]] (Success Rate: Beginner 30%, Intermediate 45%, Advanced 60%)

## Counter Transitions
- [[Re-establish Front Headlock]] → [[Front Headlock]] (against escapes)
- [[Switch to Back Control]] → [[Back Control]] (if opponent turns)
- [[Sprawl to Top Turtle]] → [[Turtle Top]] (if opponent shoots)

## Expert Insights
- **Danaher System**: Views the front headlock as a critical control position that creates a branching decision tree of submission and positional advancement options. Emphasizes precise mechanical control of the head and shoulders to prevent defensive movement before committing to specific submissions. Creates a systematic approach to choke selection based on the opponent's defensive reactions.
- **Gordon Ryan**: Uses the front headlock extensively in his no-gi system, focusing on creating seamless transitions between different choke variations to exploit defensive reactions. Emphasizes maintaining constant pressure while making subtle adjustments to head position and arm configuration based on the opponent's defensive posture.
- **Eddie Bravo**: Incorporates front headlock control as a key position in the 10th Planet system, often connecting it directly to specialized transitions like the Truck and Twister positions rather than traditional choke finishes. Emphasizes unorthodox control mechanisms and unique finishing sequences.

## Common Errors
- **Error**: Insufficient head control
  - **Consequence**: Leads to easy escape opportunities, as the opponent can pull their head out or posture up to neutralize your control.
  - **Correction**: Ensure a tight grip around their neck with your arm, pulling their head firmly to your chest or hip to maintain connection.
- **Error**: Poor body positioning
  - **Consequence**: Results in reduced leverage for attacks, as improper alignment limits your ability to apply pressure or transition effectively.
  - **Correction**: Keep your chest connected to their head and maintain a wide, stable base with your legs to maximize control and leverage.
- **Error**: Telegraphing submission entries
  - **Consequence**: Creates predictable patterns, allowing the opponent to anticipate and defend against your attacks like guillotines or anacondas.
  - **Correction**: Use subtle adjustments and feints to disguise your intentions before committing to a submission setup.
- **Error**: Neglecting base and posture
  - **Consequence**: Increases vulnerability to counters, as a weak base can allow the opponent to sweep or take you down while you focus on control.
  - **Correction**: Maintain a strong, balanced stance with your legs wide and weight centered, ready to resist takedown attempts.
- **Error**: Rushing submission attempts
  - **Consequence**: Provides defensive opportunities, as premature attacks without proper control can lead to losing the position or being countered.
  - **Correction**: Secure all control points (head, arm, posture) before initiating submissions, ensuring a higher success rate.

## Training Drills
- **Control Maintenance**: Practice front headlock control maintenance against increasing resistance, focusing on head and arm control.
- **Transition Flows**: Drill transitional flows between front headlock and related positions like Back Control or Turtle Top, ensuring smooth movement.
- **Submission Entries**: Work on submission entry sequences with progressive resistance, learning to set up chokes like guillotines or anacondas.
- **Defensive Recognition**: Engage in defensive recognition and counter drills, learning to anticipate and neutralize opponent escapes or counters.
- **Position Recovery**: Train position recovery exercises when control is compromised, focusing on re-establishing the front headlock or transitioning to another control position.

[[Front Headlock]] → [[Darce Setup]] → [[Darce Choke]] → [[Marce Choke]] → [[Won by Submission]]

## Computer Science Analogy
The Front Headlock represents a high-connectivity node in the BJJ state graph with multiple weighted edges to submission states and advantageous positions. It functions as a "gateway" control position with exceptional branching factor, where the controlling player can select from numerous high-probability paths based on the opponent's reactions. This creates a decision tree optimization problem where the player must select actions that maximize expected value while accounting for defensive responses.
