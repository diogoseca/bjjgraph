# Saddle Position Top
#bjj #state #leg_entanglement #offensive_position #heel_hook #dominant

## State Properties
- **State ID**: S232
- **Point Value**: 2 (Advantage position)
- **Position Type**: Offensive / Dominant Control
- **Risk Level**: Medium
- **Energy Cost**: Low to Medium
- **Time Sustainability**: Long

## State Description
Saddle Position Top, also known as the Honey Hole, 411, or Inside Sankaku, represents the apex of leg entanglement control in modern Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu. This position provides the optimal mechanical configuration for inside heel hook attacks while severely limiting opponent's defensive and escape options. You control opponent's leg from an inside position, meaning your legs are positioned on the inside of their trapped leg, creating superior leverage and control compared to outside positions.

The Saddle is characterized by a figure-four configuration of your legs around opponent's leg, with their heel exposed and accessible for submission attacks. Your body positioning is perpendicular to your opponent, allowing you to use hip extension and rotation to apply devastating pressure to their knee joint. This position has revolutionized modern no-gi competition and represents the culmination of systematic leg attack progression.

From a strategic standpoint, reaching the Saddle often signals the end of the positional battle. The mechanical advantages are so significant that escape becomes extremely difficult even for high-level practitioners. Understanding proper entry sequences, control maintenance, and finishing mechanics is essential for any athlete competing in submission-oriented formats or no-gi competition where heel hooks are legal.

## Visual Description
You are positioned perpendicular to your opponent, typically sitting or lying on your side with your legs forming a figure-four around their trapped leg. Your inside leg threads through their legs and hooks over their thigh, while your outside leg crosses over to secure the figure-four, creating an inescapable lock. Your hips are positioned close to their knee joint with constant pressure preventing leg extraction. One or both of your arms control their foot and heel, with your grip typically securing the heel in the crook of your elbow or armpit for maximum control. Your upper body may lean back to create finishing angles or stay closer to control their upper body and prevent sitting up. The opponent is usually on their back or trying to turn, with their trapped leg bent and their heel dangerously exposed. Their free leg is attempting to create frames or distance, but your leg configuration severely limits their mobility. The spatial relationship creates a mechanical cage where every defensive movement potentially worsens their position.

## Key Principles
- **Inside Control Priority**: Maintain inside position on trapped leg - this is the source of mechanical advantage
- **Figure-Four Integrity**: Keep legs tightly configured in figure-four without gaps or looseness
- **Hip-to-Knee Pressure**: Constant pressure on knee joint prevents extraction and facilitates submissions
- **Heel Control Methods**: Secure heel using armpit grip, crook of elbow, or various hand configurations
- **Upper Body Control**: Prevent opponent from sitting up or creating effective defensive frames
- **Finishing Mechanics**: Understand proper rotation and extension for safe but effective submissions
- **Systematic Entry**: Access Saddle through proper progression rather than forcing low-percentage entries

## Offensive Transitions
From this dominant position, you can execute:

### Submissions
- [[Inside Heel Hook]] → [[Won by Submission]] (Success Rate: Beginner 55%, Intermediate 70%, Advanced 85%)
  - Primary finish from this position with optimal mechanical advantage

- [[Toe Hold]] → [[Won by Submission]] (Success Rate: Beginner 45%, Intermediate 60%, Advanced 75%)
  - Alternative leg attack when heel is defended or to create submission dilemmas

- [[Straight Ankle Lock]] → [[Won by Submission]] (Success Rate: Beginner 50%, Intermediate 65%, Advanced 78%)
  - Legal option in restricted rulesets, still highly effective from this control position

- [[Kneebar]] → [[Won by Submission]] (Success Rate: Beginner 40%, Intermediate 55%, Advanced 70%)
  - By adjusting body position, can threaten knee with extension-based attack

### Position Maintenance
- [[Saddle Consolidation]] → [[Saddle Position Top]] (Success Rate: Beginner 65%, Intermediate 78%, Advanced 90%)
  - Adjust control when opponent attempts escapes, maintaining dominant position

- [[Back Step Adjustment]] → [[Saddle Position Top]] (Success Rate: Beginner 60%, Intermediate 75%, Advanced 88%)
  - Reset position if opponent creates slight angles

### Transitions (If Escape Begins)
- [[Return to Cross Ashi]] → [[Cross Ashi Garami Top]] (Success Rate: Beginner 50%, Intermediate 65%, Advanced 80%)
  - Step back to cross ashi if opponent begins extracting leg

- [[Transition to Outside Ashi]] → [[Ashi Garami]] (Success Rate: Beginner 45%, Intermediate 60%, Advanced 75%)
  - Adjust to outside position if inside control is compromised

- [[Crab Ride Entry]] → [[Crab Ride]] (Success Rate: Beginner 35%, Intermediate 50%, Advanced 65%)
  - If opponent turns to knees, follow with crab ride control

## Defensive Responses
When opponent attempts to escape from bottom:

- [[Heel Grip Adjustment]] → [[Saddle Position Top]] (Success Rate: 75%)
  - Adjust heel grip when opponent attempts to hide heel

- [[Hip Pressure Increase]] → [[Saddle Position Top]] (Success Rate: 70%)
  - Increase hip pressure when opponent tries to create space

- [[Upper Body Control]] → [[Saddle Position Top]] (Success Rate: 65%)
  - Prevent sitting up by controlling upper body with free arm

- [[Position Reset]] → [[Saddle Position Top]] (Success Rate: 60%)
  - If position becomes loose, use back step to re-establish clean control

## Decision Tree

**If** heel is secured and opponent's leg is extended:
- Execute [[Inside Heel Hook]] → [[Won by Submission]] (Probability: 75%)
  - Reasoning: Optimal finishing conditions - immediate submission attempt warranted
- Or Execute [[Straight Ankle Lock]] → [[Won by Submission]] (Probability: 65%)
  - Reasoning: In rulesets where heel hooks restricted, ankle lock is available

**Else if** heel is hidden but control is maintained:
- Execute [[Toe Hold]] → [[Won by Submission]] (Probability: 55%)
  - Reasoning: Toes are often exposed when heel is hidden, creating alternative attack
- Or Execute [[Hip Pressure Increase]] → [[Saddle Position Top]] (Probability: 70%)
  - Reasoning: Force heel exposure through sustained pressure and positioning

**Else if** opponent is attempting to turn into you:
- Execute [[Saddle Consolidation]] → [[Saddle Position Top]] (Probability: 75%)
  - Reasoning: Adjust legs to maintain inside control as they turn
- Or Execute [[Inside Heel Hook]] → [[Won by Submission]] (Probability: 65%)
  - Reasoning: Their turn may expose heel further, creating immediate finish opportunity

**Else if** opponent is creating significant space:
- Execute [[Return to Cross Ashi]] → [[Cross Ashi Garami Top]] (Probability: 70%)
  - Reasoning: Maintain leg entanglement by stepping back to more sustainable position
- Or Execute [[Back Step Adjustment]] → [[Saddle Position Top]] (Probability: 60%)
  - Reasoning: Reset Saddle with clean back step entry

**Else if** opponent turns to knees:
- Execute [[Crab Ride Entry]] → [[Crab Ride]] (Probability: 65%)
  - Reasoning: Follow their movement to maintain attacking position from behind
- Or Execute [[Inside Heel Hook]] → [[Won by Submission]] (Probability: 55%)
  - Reasoning: Finish quickly before they complete turtle escape

**Else** (default - solid control):
- Execute [[Inside Heel Hook]] → [[Won by Submission]] (Probability: 70%)
  - Reasoning: Standard finish from controlled Saddle position
- Or Execute [[Kneebar]] → [[Won by Submission]] (Probability: 60%)
  - Reasoning: Create submission variety to prevent defensive specialization

## Expert Insights

**John Danaher**: "The Saddle position represents the pinnacle of leg entanglement control. When you have achieved a clean Saddle with inside control, the mechanical advantages are so overwhelming that escape becomes a race against time for your opponent. The key to mastering this position is not just the finish, but understanding the systematic progression that leads here - from standard ashi through inside ashi to the Saddle. Each step reduces opponent's defensive resources while increasing your offensive options. The finish itself must be applied with intelligence - heel hooks are efficient submissions, not demonstrations of strength. Control the heel, create the proper angle through rotation, and apply pressure progressively until your opponent taps. In training, prioritize your partner's safety above all else."

**Gordon Ryan**: "The Saddle is my highest percentage finishing position. Once I get there clean, the match is essentially over. The back step entry from cross ashi is my preferred method because it's fast and catches people by surprise. What makes the Saddle so effective isn't just the heel hook - it's that opponents know how dangerous it is, so they panic and make mistakes. I'll often threaten the heel hook to force a reaction, then finish with toe hold or straight ankle because they're overcommitting to heel defense. The mental game aspect is huge. And in training, I'm always super careful with heel hooks. There's no glory in injuring training partners. I apply just enough pressure for the tap, never more."

**Eddie Bravo**: "We've been developing the Honey Hole at 10th Planet for years, and it's become one of our core positions. What I love about it is how it fits with our whole system - from the lockdown to the truck to the Honey Hole, it's all connected. The position is incredibly dominant, but you have to be smart about it. In competition, I'm going for the finish. In the gym, I'm being a good training partner and keeping it light. We teach a lot of variations at 10th Planet - different entries, different grips, different finishes. The beauty is that once you understand the mechanics, you can adapt to whatever your opponent gives you. It's not just one technique, it's a whole system."

## Common Errors

### Error: Forcing Entry Too Early
- **Consequence**: Telegraphs your intention and allows opponent to defend before you establish control, often resulting in failed entry and loss of positional advantage. Rushing to Saddle from inadequate setups leads to sloppy position that's easier to escape.
- **Correction**: Follow systematic progression - establish strong ashi garami control first, advance to inside or cross ashi, THEN execute back step to Saddle when control is secure. Each position should be consolidated before advancing.
- **Recognition**: If opponent easily defends your Saddle entries or you're frequently losing position during entry, you're forcing it too early.

### Error: Loose Figure-Four Configuration
- **Consequence**: Creates space that allows opponent to extract their leg or turn into you, completely defeating the mechanical advantage of the position. Loose legs equal escape opportunities.
- **Correction**: Keep figure-four tight with constant tension - your feet should be actively pulled toward each other, creating inescapable vise around their leg. No daylight between your legs and their trapped limb.
- **Recognition**: If you can see space between your legs and their leg, or if they're making progress extracting their leg, your figure-four is too loose.

### Error: Neglecting Hip-to-Knee Pressure
- **Consequence**: Without constant hip pressure on their knee, opponent can create the space needed for escape sequences. Hip pressure is the foundation of control in this position.
- **Correction**: Keep your hips heavy and connected to their knee joint throughout all attacks and adjustments. Think of your hips as being "glued" to their knee - when you move, the connection moves with you.
- **Recognition**: If there's a gap between your hips and their knee that you could fit your hand through, you've lost essential pressure.

### Error: Applying Heel Hook with Upper Body Strength
- **Consequence**: Inefficient submission mechanics that are easy to defend, plus risk of injuring partner through jerky, forceful movements. Heel hooks should never be muscled - they're technical submissions.
- **Correction**: Finish heel hooks with hip rotation and extension, not arm strength. Secure heel position first, then use small, controlled hip movements to create rotational pressure on knee. Progression should be smooth and gradual.
- **Recognition**: If you're using significant arm and shoulder strength, or if your finish feels like you're "ripping" the submission, your mechanics are wrong.

### Error: Losing Upper Body Control
- **Consequence**: Allows opponent to sit up and establish frames that dramatically improve their escape chances. Sitting opponent is far more dangerous than flat opponent.
- **Correction**: Use your free arm to control their upper body - push their chest down, control their wrist, or establish grips that prevent sitting. Balance heel control with upper body control.
- **Recognition**: If opponent is sitting upright and using their hands effectively against your position, you've neglected upper body control.

### Error: Staying in Saddle Against Failed Attacks
- **Consequence**: Wastes energy and gives opponent repeated opportunities to learn your finish patterns and develop specific counters. Also risks opponent becoming comfortable in the position.
- **Correction**: If initial heel hook attempts are defended, either transition to alternative submissions (toe hold, ankle lock) or step back to cross ashi to reset and re-enter. Don't stubbornly repeat failed attacks.
- **Recognition**: If you've attempted the same finish 3+ times without success and position hasn't changed, you're stuck in repetitive pattern.

### Error: Inadequate Training Safety
- **Consequence**: Partner injuries that can range from minor sprains to career-ending knee ligament tears. Heel hooks from Saddle are capable of catastrophic damage if applied carelessly.
- **Correction**: In training, apply minimal pressure - only enough for partner to recognize the position. Establish clear tap protocols before drilling. Start all repetitions at 0% pressure and increase gradually only with partner consent. Never train heel hook finishes at high intensity.
- **Recognition**: If training partners seem hesitant to work with you on leg locks, or if you've had close calls with injury, reassess your training intensity.

## Training Drills

### Drill 1: Back Step Entry Precision (Technical Repetition)
Start in cross ashi garami with cooperative partner. Practice the back step entry to Saddle, focusing on maintaining connection throughout the step-over motion. Partner remains relatively static (25% resistance) but keeps their leg in realistic defensive position. Execute entry 10 times per side, resetting fully between reps. Focus on: maintaining hip pressure during step, landing in perfect figure-four configuration, securing heel grip as you land. Progress to having partner provide specific resistances: hiding heel, turning in, creating frames. 15-20 minutes per session until back step becomes reflexive and smooth. Key metric: can you land in clean Saddle position with heel control 9 out of 10 attempts?

### Drill 2: Submission Chain Flow (Positional Response)
Establish Saddle position with partner providing 50% defensive resistance. Flow between all available submissions based on their defensive responses: heel hook when heel is exposed, toe hold when toes are available, ankle lock when foot is accessible, kneebar when leg is extended. Partner should vary their defense - sometimes hiding heel, sometimes pointing toes, sometimes extending leg. You respond with appropriate submission for each defensive configuration. 5-minute rounds, focusing on smooth transitions between attacks without losing primary control. This builds the submission variety that creates true dilemmas for opponents.

### Drill 3: Saddle Control Maintenance (Progressive Resistance)
Start in established Saddle position. Partner's goal is to escape using all legal escape methods: turning in, extracting leg, sitting up, boot kicking. Your goal is to maintain Saddle position through all escape attempts. Start at 50% resistance and progress to 75% (never 100% due to injury risk with heel hooks). Focus on: adjusting figure-four as they move, maintaining hip pressure, resetting position when needed, controlling their upper body. 3-minute rounds with 1-minute break. Track how long you can maintain position against progressive resistance. Advanced version: partner has specific escape sequence they repeat, you must nullify it.

### Drill 4: Entry Sequence From Various Positions (Positional Flow)
Practice entering Saddle from all connected positions: standard ashi, inside ashi, cross ashi, leg drag passing positions, even from top half guard. Partner provides moderate resistance (40-50%) specific to each starting position. Goal is developing versatile entry game rather than relying on single entry. 8-minute rounds, switch starting positions every 90 seconds. This builds the systematic progression understanding that separates basic leg lockers from advanced practitioners. Track which entries work best for your body type and game.

### Drill 5: Safety-First Finishing (Controlled Application)
With highly trusted partner only, practice actual heel hook finishes at minimal pressure. Partner taps the instant they feel starting pressure - this drill is about developing feel for when heel hook is truly locked, not about proving finishing power. You practice securing heel, creating proper angle, and beginning rotation using hips (not arms). Stop immediately at partner's tap. Discuss after each rep whether the position was truly controlled. This is the most important drill for safe competition application. Never rush this drill, never increase pressure beyond minimum necessary. Partner's safety is paramount. 10-15 controlled repetitions maximum per session.

## Optimal Submission Paths

**Fastest finish path** (direct):
[[Saddle Position Top]] → [[Inside Heel Hook]] → [[Won by Submission]]
*Reasoning: When heel is secured and position is clean, direct heel hook is highest percentage finish. This is the fundamental purpose of the Saddle - optimal heel hook mechanics.*

**Alternative finish path** (toe hold):
[[Saddle Position Top]] → [[Toe Hold]] → [[Won by Submission]]
*Reasoning: When opponent hides heel effectively, toes become exposed. Toe hold provides alternative attack that forces opponent to choose which joint to protect.*

**Restricted ruleset path** (IBJJF legal):
[[Saddle Position Top]] → [[Straight Ankle Lock]] → [[Won by Submission]]
*Reasoning: In competitions where heel hooks are restricted, straight ankle lock remains highly effective from Saddle control. Position provides excellent leverage for ankle attacks.*

**Dilemma creation path** (Craig Jones philosophy):
[[Saddle Position Top]] → [[Toe Hold Threat]] → [[Inside Heel Hook]] → [[Won by Submission]]
*Reasoning: Threaten toe hold to force defensive reaction that exposes heel. Opponent must choose between protecting heel or toes, creating no-win situation.*

**Kneebar variation path** (alternative attack):
[[Saddle Position Top]] → [[Kneebar Adjustment]] → [[Kneebar]] → [[Won by Submission]]
*Reasoning: By adjusting body position slightly, can threaten kneebar. Useful against opponents who specialize in heel hook defense but lack kneebar defense.*

**Progressive advancement path** (systematic):
[[Cross Ashi Garami Top]] → [[Back Step to Saddle]] → [[Saddle Position Top]] → [[Inside Heel Hook]] → [[Won by Submission]]
*Reasoning: Shows complete progression from transitional position through entry to finish. This is the systematic approach emphasized by Danaher - earn the position through proper progression.*

## Position Metrics
- **Position Retention Rate**: Beginner 60%, Intermediate 75%, Advanced 88%
- **Submission Success Rate**: Beginner 55%, Intermediate 70%, Advanced 85%
- **Escape Denial Rate**: Beginner 65%, Intermediate 80%, Advanced 92%
- **Position Loss Probability**: Beginner 25%, Intermediate 15%, Advanced 8%
- **Average Time to Submission**: 30-60 seconds

## Timing Considerations

**Optimal Entry Timing**:
- When opponent is focused on defending current position and doesn't anticipate advancement
- After opponent attempts escape from cross ashi - capitalize on their movement
- When opponent's leg is extended and heel is exposed during transition
- Early in match when opponent has full energy but may lack defensive refinement

**Best Finishing Moments**:
- Immediately after securing position before opponent sets defensive frames
- When opponent attempts escape and extends their leg in the process
- After threatening alternative submission that forces heel exposure
- When opponent is fatigued and their defensive discipline declines

**Position Sustainability**:
- Saddle can be maintained for extended periods (2-3 minutes) with good control
- Unlike many dominant positions, doesn't require high energy output to maintain
- Longer time in position increases finishing probability as opponent fatigues
- Can use position to control pace and time in competition scenarios

**Risk Assessment**:
- First 10 seconds after entry are most vulnerable to escape - consolidate control first
- If opponent successfully hides heel for 30+ seconds, consider transition to alternative attack
- After failed submission attempt, reassess control before attacking again
- Energy investment is low enough that multiple attack attempts are sustainable

## Competition Considerations

**Rule Set Variations**:
- **IBJJF**: Heel hooks prohibited until brown/black belt; must use ankle locks and toe holds at lower belts
- **ADCC**: Full leg attack game allowed; Saddle position sees heavy use
- **Submission Underground/WNO**: Saddle is high-percentage position due to submission-only format
- **EBI Overtime**: Position's control allows for strategic time management

**Strategic Applications**:
- In points-based competition, Saddle provides control without point scoring - use strategically when ahead
- In submission-only, Saddle is often preferred finishing position due to mechanical advantages
- Against larger opponents, Saddle neutralizes size advantage through technical control
- Late in match, Saddle's low energy cost makes it ideal position for tired athletes

**Competition Psychology**:
- Many competitors fear heel hooks, creating mental advantage when you establish Saddle
- Reputation for Saddle proficiency can cause opponents to avoid leg entanglements entirely
- Must balance aggressive finishing with match strategy - early submission vs. controlled victory
- Clean Saddle entries often signal to opponent that their defensive knowledge has gap

## Historical Context

The Saddle position, while having roots in catch wrestling and sambo, was systematically refined and popularized in modern BJJ by John Danaher and his students in the mid-2010s. The position was previously known but not widely understood or taught in most BJJ academies. Through systematic analysis and competition success (particularly by Garry Tonon, Gordon Ryan, Eddie Cummings, and Nicky Ryan), the Danaher Death Squad demonstrated the position's dominance in professional no-gi competition. This forced the broader BJJ community to develop defensive responses and incorporate leg entanglement studies into their curriculum. The position's name variations (Saddle, Honey Hole, 411, Inside Sankaku) reflect different training lineages and geographic regions, but all describe essentially the same configuration. Eddie Bravo's 10th Planet system independently developed similar positions under the "Honey Hole" terminology, contributing to the position's evolution. The systematic approach to leg entanglements, with the Saddle as the apex position, represents one of the significant technical evolutions in BJJ's history.

## Safety Considerations

**CRITICAL WARNING**: The Saddle position provides optimal leverage for heel hook submissions, which are among the most dangerous techniques in BJJ. Heel hooks can cause ACL, MCL, and LCL tears that require surgical reconstruction and extensive rehabilitation. Unlike chokes or many joint locks where pain precedes structural damage, heel hooks can cause catastrophic injury before significant pain is felt.

**Training Safety Protocols**:
- Only train heel hooks from Saddle with partners who understand the risks and mechanics
- Always start with zero pressure - partner should tap to position, not to pain
- Establish verbal and physical tap signals before training
- Never increase pressure quickly - progression should be gradual and controlled
- If partner doesn't tap to light pressure, release and discuss - never force the finish
- Beginners should spend months on position control before attempting actual heel hook finishes
- Consider using heel hook specific training - establish position, partner taps, reset
- Some athletes never train heel hook finishes at high intensity, only positional control

**Competition Safety**:
- In competition with heel hooks allowed, finish progressively even under adrenaline
- If opponent doesn't tap immediately, don't assume they're being tough - they may not realize danger
- Consider verbal warning ("heel hook, tap") before finishing on less experienced opponents
- Respect taps instantly - no "extra pull" after tap
- Understand that winning match is not worth causing permanent injury

This position requires mature, safety-conscious training. If you're not prepared to train it safely, don't train it at all.
