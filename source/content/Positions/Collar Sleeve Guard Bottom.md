# Collar Sleeve Guard Bottom
#bjj #state #guard #bottom #gi

## State Properties
- **State ID**: S060
- **Point Value**: 0 (Neutral guard position)
- **Position Type**: Defensive with strong offensive options
- **Risk Level**: Low-Medium
- **Energy Cost**: Medium
- **Time Sustainability**: Long

## State Description
Collar Sleeve Guard Bottom is a fundamental gi-specific open guard position where the bottom player controls one of the opponent's collar grips (typically cross-collar) and the opposite sleeve, creating a strong control system based on asymmetric gripping. This guard position is highly versatile, offering numerous sweeping and submission opportunities while maintaining defensive security through grip control.

The position is characterized by the cross-body grip pattern: controlling the opponent's left collar with your right hand while gripping their right sleeve with your left hand, or vice versa. This diagonal control system creates powerful leverage for breaking posture, preventing passing, and setting up attacks. One or both feet typically rest on the opponent's hips, biceps, or collar to manage distance and create angles.

Collar Sleeve Guard is one of the most common and effective gi guard positions, seen at all levels of competition from white belt to black belt. It provides a solid foundation for developing guard concepts including distance management, angle creation, and grip-based control systems. The position naturally flows into many other guard variations and attack sequences.

## Visual Description
You are on your back with your right hand gripping deep into your opponent's left collar, creating a strong cross-collar grip that pulls down on their posture. Your left hand controls their right sleeve at the wrist or cuff, preventing them from posting or creating effective base on that side. Your right foot typically rests on their left hip, creating distance and preventing forward pressure, while your left foot may be on their right hip, bicep, or ready to create angles. Your shoulders are off the mat with your core engaged, allowing you to actively pull and push simultaneously. The collar grip pulls them forward and down while the sleeve grip extends their arm, creating tension throughout their body that limits their movement options. Your hips are mobile and positioned to create angles off to either side, allowing for sweeps and attacks. The combination of pulling their collar and extending their sleeve creates a broken posture that makes passing difficult while setting up multiple attacking sequences. The position feels active and controlling despite being on bottom, with your grips dictating the pace and options available to your opponent.

## Key Principles
- **Asymmetric Control**: Cross-body grip pattern (collar and opposite sleeve) creates powerful leverage and off-balancing opportunities
- **Distance Management**: Feet on hips or biceps control opponent's distance and prevent pressure passing
- **Posture Breaking**: Collar grip constantly pulls opponent forward, destroying their passing posture
- **Arm Extension**: Sleeve control extends one arm, limiting their posting ability and base
- **Angle Creation**: Hip movement off center creates angles for sweeps and submissions
- **Grip Fighting**: Active grip fighting prevents opponent from establishing their preferred controls
- **Chain Attacks**: Multiple attacks flow naturally from the position, creating decision dilemmas

## Decision Tree

**If** opponent postures strongly and extends arms:
- Execute [[Collar Drag Sweep]] → [[Top Position]] (Probability: 60%)
  - Reasoning: Strong posture creates opportunity for collar drag when pulling forward
- Or Execute [[Balloon Sweep]] → [[Mount]] (Probability: 50%)
  - Reasoning: Extended arms and high posture enable overhead sweep

**Else if** opponent drives forward with pressure:
- Execute [[Scissor Sweep Variation]] → [[Mount]] (Probability: 55%)
  - Reasoning: Forward pressure provides momentum for scissor sweep mechanics
- Or Execute [[Triangle Choke]] → [[Triangle Control]] (Probability: 50%)
  - Reasoning: Forward pressure breaks posture, enabling triangle entry

**Else if** opponent attempts to pass to controlled sleeve side:
- Execute [[Sleeve Drag Sweep]] → [[Back Take]] (Probability: 60%)
  - Reasoning: Passing movement toward controlled side creates back take opportunity
- Or Execute [[Omoplata]] → [[Omoplata Control]] (Probability: 50%)
  - Reasoning: Opponent's arm positioning during pass exposes shoulder

**Else** (balanced opponent maintaining distance):
- Execute [[Spider Guard Transition]] → [[Spider Guard Bottom]] (Probability: 55%)
  - Reasoning: Extend guard to create more control when opponent maintains distance
- Or Execute [[Lasso Guard Entry]] → [[Lasso Guard Bottom]] (Probability: 50%)
  - Reasoning: Lasso provides additional control and sweep opportunities

## Expert Insights

**John Danaher**: "Collar sleeve guard represents one of the most efficient expressions of fundamental guard concepts. The asymmetric grip pattern creates inherent mechanical advantages - you're pulling with one hand while pushing with the other, creating tension that disrupts the opponent's structure. The key to effectiveness is understanding that the grips are not merely holding positions; they are active tools constantly working to break posture and create reactions. When the opponent resists your collar pull, they expose themselves to sleeve drag attacks. When they resist the sleeve control, the collar drag becomes available. This action-reaction dynamic is what makes the position so effective. Students should focus on maintaining active grips that constantly threaten, rather than static grips that merely hold. The position serves as an excellent laboratory for learning fundamental principles of leverage, base destruction, and systematic attack progression."

**Gordon Ryan**: "I don't play a ton of collar sleeve in competition because I'm focused on leg locks and passing, but when I was coming up, this was one of my foundational guards. The thing about collar sleeve is that it's simple but effective - you don't need to be super flexible or have perfect timing like some other guards. You just need good grips and good reactions. If they push, you pull. If they pull, you push. Basic physics. The sweep percentage is high because you're constantly creating off-balancing moments. For beginners especially, this guard teaches you how grips create control and how to chain attacks together. Learn this guard well before you try to get fancy with berimbolos and inverted stuff. Solid fundamentals win matches."

**Eddie Bravo**: "Collar sleeve is old school, but it works. In 10th Planet we obviously focus more on no-gi, but my gi players use collar sleeve all the time because it's versatile and it flows into a lot of positions we like. The sleeve drag to back is huge for us - we're always hunting the back. The omoplata entries from collar sleeve are smooth. What I like about it is that it's not a static position - you're constantly moving, constantly threatening. That matches our philosophy of being active and offensive from everywhere. If you're holding collar sleeve and just chilling, you're doing it wrong. You should be making the top guy work and react. That's when you catch them."

## Common Errors

### Error: Passive or static gripping
- **Consequence**: Opponent establishes solid posture and base, initiating effective passing sequences without facing active threats. Passive grips waste the position's offensive potential.
- **Correction**: Grips must be active and dynamic. Constantly pull collar down and extend sleeve out. Create off-balancing moments every 2-3 seconds. If opponent feels comfortable, your grips aren't working. Use grips to threaten attacks continuously, not just hold position.
- **Recognition**: If opponent is stable and comfortable, your grips are passive.

### Error: Same-side grip pattern (collar and sleeve on same side)
- **Consequence**: Dramatically reduces sweeping leverage and allows opponent to circle away from control. Same-side grips lack the cross-body tension that makes collar sleeve effective.
- **Correction**: Always maintain cross-body grip pattern - right hand to opponent's left collar, left hand to their right sleeve, or vice versa. This diagonal control creates the tension and leverage needed for attacks. If grips get scrambled, reset to proper cross-body configuration immediately.
- **Recognition**: If your grips are both on same side of opponent's body, reset immediately.

### Error: Neglecting foot positioning on hips or biceps
- **Consequence**: Opponent closes distance and drives forward pressure, collapsing your guard structure and initiating pressure passes. Without foot control, opponent controls distance.
- **Correction**: Maintain at least one foot on opponent's hip, bicep, or collar at all times. Feet actively push to manage distance while hands pull. This push-pull dynamic creates tension throughout opponent's body. When transitioning between attacks, maintain foot contact.
- **Recognition**: If opponent is close to your hips without your permission, foot positioning failed.

### Error: Allowing opponent to establish their preferred grips
- **Consequence**: Opponent secures passing grips (pants, lapels) that facilitate guard passing while neutralizing your controls. Losing grip battle loses position.
- **Correction**: Active grip fighting is mandatory. Break opponent's grip attempts immediately. Use collar control to keep them extended and unable to establish strong grips. Re-grip quickly if your grips are broken. Grip fighting is continuous throughout guard play.
- **Recognition**: If opponent has both pants grips or strong passing grips, you lost grip battle.

### Error: Staying centered with hips directly under opponent
- **Consequence**: Reduces sweep angles and allows opponent to drive straight forward with pressure, making guard retention difficult. Centered hips eliminate sweep leverage.
- **Correction**: Create angles by moving hips off center line. Angle toward controlled sleeve side to create sweep opportunities. Hip movement should be constant - create angle, attack, recover, create new angle. Never stay static on centerline.
- **Recognition**: If your hips haven't moved in 5+ seconds, you're too centered.

### Error: Weak or incorrect collar grip
- **Consequence**: Opponent easily postures up and breaks your collar control, neutralizing your primary control mechanism and making guard passing easier. Weak collar grip loses the position.
- **Correction**: Deep cross-collar grip with four fingers inside collar, thumb out. Pull down and across, not just down. Grip must be strong enough to break posture even when opponent resists. Practice gi grips regularly to develop grip strength and endurance.
- **Recognition**: If opponent easily postures despite your collar pull, grip is weak or incorrectly positioned.

### Error: Not transitioning between attacks
- **Consequence**: Opponent defends single attack and settles into defensive position, neutralizing your offensive threats and preparing to pass. Static attack patterns are predictable.
- **Correction**: Chain attacks together continuously. Failed sweep becomes submission entry. Defended submission becomes different sweep. Create constant pressure through attack variety. Flow between collar drags, balloon sweeps, triangles, omoplatas. Keep opponent defending and reacting.
- **Recognition**: If opponent successfully defends same attack twice, you need to change tactics immediately.

## Training Drills

### Drill 1: Grip Establishment and Maintenance
Start with no grips. On signal, both players fight for grips. Bottom player works to establish collar-sleeve control while top player prevents and breaks grips. Focus on speed of grip establishment and recovery after grips are broken. Emphasize proper cross-body grip pattern and hand positioning. 2-minute rounds with 30-second rest, 6 rounds, switch roles each round. This builds grip fighting attributes essential for guard play.

### Drill 2: Sweep Combinations Flow
Begin in collar sleeve guard with established grips. Flow through sweep combinations: collar drag to balloon sweep to scissor sweep to sleeve drag. Partner provides light resistance (30%) but allows smooth transitions. Goal is to understand connections between different sweeps and develop muscle memory for entries. Focus on maintaining grips throughout transitions and creating proper angles. 6 minutes continuous flow, switch roles.

### Drill 3: Posture Breaking Cycles
Partner in standing or combat base. Your goal is to break their posture using collar sleeve grips, then they recover posture, then you break again. Focus on using collar pull and sleeve extension in coordination with foot placement on hips/biceps. Partner provides progressive resistance (start 40%, increase to 70%). Develop feel for when posture is truly broken versus when opponent is defending successfully. 4 minutes per role, continuous work.

### Drill 4: Submission Entries from Collar Sleeve
With partner maintaining static guard top position, practice submission entries: triangle setup, omoplata entry, armbar transition, collar choke setup. Focus on using existing grips as foundation for submission attacks. Slow and technical, emphasizing proper mechanics. Partner provides feedback on positioning and setup quality. No finishing, just entries. 5 minutes per side, reset after each submission setup.

### Drill 5: Live Positional Sparring
Start in collar sleeve guard, full intensity. Bottom player works to sweep, submit, or improve position. Top player works to pass or establish dominant grips. Reset to starting position after major position change (sweep or pass). This builds realistic timing, grip fighting under pressure, and decision-making. 2-minute rounds with 1-minute rest, 8 rounds, alternate roles each round.

## Optimal Submission Paths

**Fastest path to submission** (direct):
[[Collar Sleeve Guard Bottom]] → [[Triangle Choke]] → [[Triangle Control]] → [[Won by Submission]]
*Reasoning: Direct submission attack using collar control to break posture. High percentage when opponent drives forward.*

**High-percentage path** (sweep to dominance):
[[Collar Sleeve Guard Bottom]] → [[Collar Drag Sweep]] → [[Top Position]] → [[Mount]] → [[Submission from Mount]] → [[Won by Submission]]
*Reasoning: Sweep first to establish dominance, then finish from superior position. More systematic and controlled.*

**Alternative submission path** (shoulder lock):
[[Collar Sleeve Guard Bottom]] → [[Omoplata]] → [[Omoplata Control]] → [[Omoplata Finish]] → [[Won by Submission]]
*Reasoning: Shoulder lock attack using sleeve control. Effective when opponent defends arm across body.*

**Back take path** (highest percentage):
[[Collar Sleeve Guard Bottom]] → [[Sleeve Drag to Back]] → [[Back Control]] → [[Rear Naked Choke]] → [[Won by Submission]]
*Reasoning: Take back from guard, establish hooks and control, finish with choke. Often highest percentage from guard positions.*

**Guard variation path** (adaptability):
[[Collar Sleeve Guard Bottom]] → [[Spider Guard Transition]] → [[Spider Guard Bottom]] → [[Spider Guard Sweep]] → [[Mount]] → [[Won by Submission]]
*Reasoning: Transition to more controlled guard variation when collar sleeve is defended, then sweep and finish.*

- **Position Retention Rate**: Beginner 55%, Intermediate 70%, Advanced 85%
- **Advancement Probability**: Beginner 45%, Intermediate 60%, Advanced 75%
- **Submission Probability**: Beginner 25%, Intermediate 40%, Advanced 60%
- **Position Loss Probability**: Beginner 35%, Intermediate 20%, Advanced 10%
- **Average Time in Position**: 30-120 seconds (varies with game pace)

## Competition Considerations

**Point Scoring**: Collar sleeve guard is neutral (0 points) in IBJJF and similar rulesets. Successful sweeps from this position score 2 points. Guard passes against this position score 3 points. Focus is on using position to score through sweeps or create submission opportunities.

**Time Management**: This is an active guard position suitable for both fast and slow-paced matches. You can control match pace through grip fighting and attack selection. Against aggressive passers, slow them down with strong grips. Against passive opponents, create tempo with constant attacks.

**Rule Set Adaptations**: Collar sleeve is gi-specific and only functions in gi competition (IBJJF, ADCC gi divisions). Does not translate to no-gi where collar grips are unavailable. In gi competition, this is one of the most fundamental guards across all belt levels.

**Competition Strategy**: Against opponents with strong passing, collar sleeve provides reliable control and defensive security. Against opponents weak in grip fighting, aggressive collar sleeve play can dominate the match. Use grip fighting to drain opponent's grip strength over time, then attack when their grips weaken. The position ages well in competition - it's effective at all skill levels.

## Historical Context

Collar sleeve guard represents traditional BJJ guard fundamentals, present in the art from the earliest days of gi grappling. While many modern guards are relatively recent innovations, collar sleeve has been taught and refined for decades. The grip pattern reflects fundamental principles of leverage and base destruction that are timeless in gi grappling. Modern competitors continue to use collar sleeve as a foundational position, demonstrating its enduring effectiveness despite the evolution of more complex guard systems.
