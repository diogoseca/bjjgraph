# Butterfly Hook Retention Bottom
#bjj #state #guard #butterfly #bottom #retention

## State Properties
- **State ID**: S276
- **Point Value**: 0 (Guard position)
- **Position Type**: Defensive with strong offensive options
- **Risk Level**: Medium
- **Energy Cost**: Medium
- **Time Sustainability**: Medium to Long

## State Description

Butterfly Hook Retention Bottom is a dynamic guard position where the bottom player maintains at least one butterfly hook (foot positioned on opponent's inner thigh) while actively working to prevent the opponent from passing. This position emphasizes hook maintenance as the primary defensive priority, as the hooks provide the mechanical advantage necessary for sweeps and guard recovery. Unlike static butterfly guard, this position represents the active defensive phase where the passer is attempting to remove or bypass the hooks.

The position is characterized by constant movement and adjustment, with the bottom player using their hooks as both offensive weapons and defensive barriers. Successful hook retention requires understanding weight distribution, timing, and the ability to quickly transition between different guard configurations.

## Visual Description

You are seated or partially reclined on your buttocks with one or both feet positioned as hooks on your opponent's inner thighs. Your hips are mobile and elevated off the mat, using core engagement to maintain the hook positioning. The opponent is positioned between your legs, typically attempting to establish grips and control your upper body to remove your hooks. Your arms are actively working for grips - typically collar, sleeve, or overhook controls - while your upper body maintains an upright or slightly reclined posture that facilitates hook retention. Your hooks apply inward and upward pressure against the opponent's thighs, creating a mechanical barrier that prevents them from advancing their hips forward. The spatial relationship is highly dynamic, with you constantly adjusting hook depth, angle, and which leg maintains the primary hook based on the opponent's passing attempts. This creates a fluid defensive structure where your hooks must remain engaged despite the opponent's efforts to flatten you, backstep around you, or drive your knees together to neutralize the hook's effectiveness.

## Key Principles

- **Hook Depth Control**: Maintain optimal hook depth - not too shallow (easily cleared) or too deep (limits mobility)
- **Hip Mobility**: Keep hips elevated and mobile to adjust hook angles
- **Active Resistance**: Use hooks to actively push opponent's legs outward, creating space
- **Frame Integration**: Combine hooks with upper body frames for comprehensive defense
- **Constant Readjustment**: Hooks must be dynamic, not static - adjust continuously
- **Posture Maintenance**: Maintain upright posture to support hook strength
- **Transition Readiness**: Be prepared to transition to X-Guard, Single Leg X, or other guards if hooks are compromised

## Offensive Transitions

From this position, you can execute:

### Sweeps
- [[Butterfly Sweep]] → [[Top Position]] (Success Rate: Beginner 45%, Intermediate 60%, Advanced 75%)
  - Classic butterfly sweep using hooks for elevation and off-balancing

- [[Hook Sweep]] → [[Top Position]] (Success Rate: Beginner 50%, Intermediate 65%, Advanced 80%)
  - Single hook sweep when one hook is maintained strongly

- [[Arm Drag Sweep]] → [[Back Control]] (Success Rate: Beginner 40%, Intermediate 55%, Advanced 70%)
  - Combine arm drag with hook to achieve back take

### Guard Transitions
- [[X-Guard Entry]] → [[X-Guard]] (Success Rate: Beginner 50%, Intermediate 65%, Advanced 80%)
  - Convert butterfly hook to X-Guard structure

- [[Single Leg X Entry]] → [[Single Leg X Guard]] (Success Rate: Beginner 45%, Intermediate 60%, Advanced 75%)
  - Transition to Single Leg X when opponent stands

- [[Deep Half Entry]] → [[Deep Half Guard]] (Success Rate: Beginner 40%, Intermediate 55%, Advanced 70%)
  - Dive under to deep half guard when hooks are threatened

### Attacks
- [[Guillotine Setup]] → [[Guillotine Control]] (Success Rate: Beginner 35%, Intermediate 50%, Advanced 65%)
  - Attack neck when opponent lowers head

## Defensive Responses

When opponent has this position against you (top player perspective):

- [[Backstep Pass]] → [[Side Control Top]] (Success Rate: 65%)
  - Circle behind hooks to neutralize their effectiveness

- [[Smash Pass]] → [[Side Control Top]] (Success Rate: 60%)
  - Drive knees together and flatten opponent

- [[Knee Cut Pass]] → [[Side Control Top]] (Success Rate: 55%)
  - Cut knee through hook space

- [[Standing Pass]] → [[Open Guard Top]] (Success Rate: 50%)
  - Stand to eliminate hook effectiveness

## Decision Tree

**If** opponent attempts to backstep around hooks:
- Execute [[X-Guard Entry]] → [[X-Guard]] (Probability: 70%)
  - Reasoning: Follow their circular motion and capture leg with X-Guard

**Else if** opponent drives forward to smash:
- Execute [[Butterfly Sweep]] → [[Top Position]] (Probability: 65%)
  - Reasoning: Use forward pressure against them with elevator motion

**Else if** opponent stands up:
- Execute [[Single Leg X Entry]] → [[Single Leg X Guard]] (Probability: 75%)
  - Reasoning: Adapt hook structure to standing position

**Else** (opponent remains engaged in mid-range):
- Execute [[Hook Sweep]] → [[Top Position]] (Probability: 60%)
  - Reasoning: Maintain hooks and create sweeping opportunities

## Expert Insights

**John Danaher**: "The butterfly hooks represent one of the most mechanically efficient structures in guard retention. The inward and upward pressure of the hooks creates a natural barrier that prevents hip advancement, which is essential for all passing attempts. Hook retention is not about grip strength but about understanding weight distribution and timing - you must learn to feel when the opponent shifts their weight to one side and immediately adjust your hooks accordingly. The critical concept is that hooks are most powerful when integrated with upper body control, creating a complete defensive system."

**Gordon Ryan**: "In modern no-gi competition, butterfly hook retention is absolutely essential because it provides the foundation for nearly all my guard recovery and sweeping sequences. I use hook retention as a transitional position - I'm never staying here long, always looking to either sweep immediately or transition to X-Guard or Single Leg X. The key is being aggressive with the hooks, constantly threatening sweeps to freeze the opponent's passing attempts. When they defend the sweep, that's when you transition to deeper guards."

**Eddie Bravo**: "Butterfly hooks are the gateway to the entire 10th Planet guard system. From hook retention, you can access the lockdown, deep half, electric chair, and numerous other positions. The critical skill is learning to maintain at least one strong hook even when the opponent is working hard to remove them. We drill butterfly hook recovery constantly because if you lose both hooks against a skilled passer, you're in serious trouble. The hooks are your anchor point - everything else flows from there."

## Common Errors

### Error: Keeping hips flat on the mat
- **Consequence**: Flat hips make hooks weak and passive, allowing opponent to easily drive forward, remove hooks, or backstep around them without significant resistance
- **Correction**: Keep hips elevated off the mat using core engagement. Your buttocks should be lightly touching or hovering, with weight distributed through your shoulders and hooks
- **Recognition**: If opponent easily advances their hips or removes your hooks without effort, your hips are likely too flat

### Error: Static hook positioning without adjustment
- **Consequence**: Static hooks become predictable and easy to counter - opponent can time their passing attempts to moments when hooks are overextended or poorly angled
- **Correction**: Constantly adjust hook depth, angle, and pressure based on opponent's weight distribution and passing direction. Hooks should be dynamic and responsive
- **Recognition**: Finding yourself repeatedly passed with the same technique indicates you're not adjusting hooks appropriately

### Error: Neglecting upper body control while focusing on hooks
- **Consequence**: Hooks alone are insufficient - without upper body grips and frames, opponent can control your shoulders and flatten you despite maintained hooks
- **Correction**: Integrate collar ties, overhooks, or sleeve grips with your hook retention. Upper body control prevents flattening and creates sweep opportunities
- **Recognition**: If opponent is able to flatten your upper body despite maintained hooks, you're neglecting upper body defensive structure

### Error: Overcommitting to keeping both hooks at all times
- **Consequence**: Attempting to maintain both hooks against all passing attempts leads to poor transitions and vulnerability - sometimes one strong hook is better than two weak ones
- **Correction**: Accept that one hook may be compromised and focus on maintaining the stronger hook while transitioning to appropriate guards (X-Guard, Single Leg X)
- **Recognition**: Struggling unsuccessfully to keep both hooks while position deteriorates indicates you should have transitioned earlier

### Error: Passive hook maintenance without offensive threats
- **Consequence**: Purely defensive hook retention allows opponent to methodically work their passing sequences - without sweep threats, they face no consequences for aggressive passing
- **Correction**: Constantly threaten sweeps and transitions to force opponent into defensive reactions. Hook retention should be active and threatening, not passive
- **Recognition**: If opponent is calmly working their passing game without concern, you're not creating enough offensive threat

## Training Drills

### Drill 1: Hook Retention Against Progressive Pressure
Partner starts in butterfly guard top with 25% pressure, attempting to remove your hooks through various methods (backstep, smash, knee cut). Your goal is to maintain at least one strong hook for 30-second rounds. Progressively increase pressure to 50%, 75%, then 100%. Focus on hip mobility, hook readjustment, and transitioning between different hook configurations. 5 rounds per resistance level, resting 30 seconds between rounds. This drill develops the fundamental skill of maintaining hooks under pressure.

### Drill 2: Hook to Sweep Combinations
Starting with established butterfly hooks, partner provides 50% resistance as you chain together different sweep attempts: butterfly sweep → hook sweep → arm drag. When one sweep is defended, immediately transition to the next option. Focus on using hook retention to create multiple sweeping threats. 3-minute rounds, 5 repetitions. Emphasizes offensive hook usage rather than passive retention.

### Drill 3: Guard Transition Flow from Hook Retention
Partner attempts various passing strategies while you maintain hooks and flow between guard positions: butterfly hooks → X-Guard → Single Leg X → back to butterfly hooks. Partner applies progressive resistance starting at 30% and building to 70%. The goal is smooth transitions without losing guard completely. 5-minute continuous flow, switching roles every minute. Develops the ability to use hooks as a transitional platform for multiple guard systems.
