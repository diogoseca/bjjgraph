## State Description

Lasso Guard Bottom is an effective open guard position where the bottom player threads their opponent's arm through their leg, creating a powerful control mechanism that limits the opponent's mobility and posture. This position excels at preventing guard passes while setting up sweeps and back takes, making it a staple of gi-based BJJ.

The lasso control is achieved by placing your foot through the opponent's sleeve or armpit, wrapping your leg around their arm while controlling the sleeve grip with your hand. This creates a strong connection that disrupts the opponent's ability to establish effective passing pressure or maintain balanced posture.

The position is particularly effective against opponents who attempt to stack or pressure pass, as the lasso wrapping naturally deflects forward pressure and creates off-balancing opportunities. However, it requires precise grip management and timing to maintain against experienced passers who know how to clear the lasso.

## Visual Description

You are on your back with one leg threaded through your opponent's arm, your shin wrapping around their bicep or threading through their armpit and sleeve. Your foot hooks around their arm, creating a lasso-like control that restricts their movement and compromises their posture. Your other leg extends to create frames or hooks for sweeps, typically controlling their hip, knee, or posting as a butterfly hook. Your hands maintain crucial grips—one controlling the lassoed arm's sleeve to prevent escape, the other gripping their opposite collar, pants, or belt to break posture and create angles. Your hips are active, constantly adjusting angles and distances to off-balance your opponent and prevent them from establishing stable passing pressure. The lasso-wrapped leg creates a powerful lever that allows you to control their upper body while your free leg manages distance and sets up attacks.

## Key Principles

- **Lasso Control Maintenance**: Keep constant tension on the lassoed arm through leg pressure and sleeve grip to prevent arm extraction
- **Hip Angle Management**: Constantly adjust hip angles to off-balance opponent and prevent stacking or smash passing attempts
- **Dual-Function Leg Usage**: Use lassoed leg for control while free leg manages distance and creates sweep entries
- **Grip Fighting Priority**: Maintain sleeve grip on lassoed arm and secondary control grips to break posture and limit opponent options
- **Dynamic Distance Management**: Use extension and retraction of legs to control spacing and prevent opponent from establishing passing pressure
- **Back Exposure Awareness**: Recognize when opponent's compromised posture creates back take opportunities through inversion or technical stand-up
- **Energy Conservation**: Balance active control with relaxation periods, as maintaining lasso requires sustained leg and grip strength

## Decision Tree

**If** opponent maintains upright posture:
- Execute [[Lasso Sweep]] → [[Mount]] (Probability: 50%)
  - Reasoning: Upright posture creates leverage for rotational sweep using lasso control
- Or Execute [[Technical Stand-Up Sweep]] → [[Standing Position]] (Probability: 55%)
  - Reasoning: High posture allows you to come up on lasso side while maintaining arm control

**Else if** opponent drives forward with stacking pressure:
- Execute [[Omoplata]] → [[Omoplata Control]] (Probability: 40%)
  - Reasoning: Forward pressure commits opponent's shoulder, enabling omoplata entry
- Or Execute [[Triangle Choke]] → [[Triangle Control]] (Probability: 35%)
  - Reasoning: Stack creates angle for bringing leg over head into triangle position

**Else if** opponent attempts to clear lasso:
- Transition to [[Spider Guard Bottom]] → [[Spider Guard Bottom]] (Probability: 60%)
  - Reasoning: If lasso is breaking, transition to different guard retention system
- Or Execute [[Back Take from Lasso]] → [[Back Control]] (Probability: 50%)
  - Reasoning: Opponent's clearing motion can expose back if you invert or technical stand

**Else if** opponent establishes low, smash passing posture:
- Execute [[Balloon Sweep]] → [[Mount]] (Probability: 40%)
  - Reasoning: Low posture positions opponent for elevation sweep using lasso and free leg
- Or Transition to [[Reverse De La Riva Guard]] → [[Reverse De La Riva Guard]] (Probability: 45%)
  - Reasoning: Add reverse DLR hook to lasso for additional control against smash pass

**Else** (balanced opponent / default):
- Break posture and initiate [[Lasso Sweep]] → [[Mount]] (Probability: 45%)
  - Reasoning: Classic lasso sweep is high-percentage against neutral opponent
- Or Execute [[Omoplata Sweep]] → [[Side Control Top]] (Probability: 40%)
  - Reasoning: Omoplata threat creates defensive reactions that open sweep opportunities

## Expert Insights

**John Danaher**: "The lasso guard represents an asymmetric control system where you create a mechanical advantage through the wrapping of your leg around the opponent's arm. The key is understanding that the lasso itself is not the attack—it's the control mechanism that creates the angles and off-balancing opportunities necessary for your actual attacks. Focus on using the lasso to break down the opponent's posture and structure, then exploit the resulting vulnerabilities with your free leg's sweep entries."

**Gordon Ryan**: "I use lasso guard primarily as a transitional position rather than a home base. The moment I establish lasso control, I'm immediately looking for the back take or the sweep—I'm not hanging out there. The lasso is most effective when you're constantly threatening multiple attacks, forcing the opponent to make defensive choices that expose other vulnerabilities. If they defend the sweep, I'm going to the back; if they defend the back take, I'm going for the sweep or submission."

**Eddie Bravo**: "The lasso creates a unique arm control that's different from traditional guard systems, but you've got to be careful about getting stacked. I prefer using it as part of a larger guard system where I can flow between lasso, spider, and De La Riva based on what the opponent gives me. The key innovation is combining the lasso with inverted positions or technical stand-ups to create dynamic back take opportunities that traditional lasso players miss."

## Common Errors

### Error: Static lasso without hip movement
- **Consequence**: Allows opponent to establish stable base and passing pressure, making you vulnerable to stack passes and making your sweeps ineffective. Static lasso becomes easy to defend and pass.
- **Correction**: Constantly adjust hip angles and distances, creating dynamic movement that keeps opponent off-balance. Move your hips in circles, adjust angles laterally, and use extension/retraction to prevent opponent from setting their base.
- **Recognition**: If you feel like opponent is comfortably pressuring into you without being off-balanced, you're being too static. You should feel constant adjustment and movement.

### Error: Weak or broken sleeve grip on lassoed arm
- **Consequence**: Opponent can extract their arm from lasso, neutralizing your primary control mechanism and allowing them to establish passing grips and pressure. Entire position collapses without this crucial grip.
- **Correction**: Maintain death grip on lassoed arm's sleeve with constant tension. If grip breaks, immediately re-establish or transition to different guard system. Use both hand and leg pressure to trap the arm.
- **Recognition**: If opponent's lassoed arm is moving freely or extracting from your leg, your grip is inadequate. You should feel locked connection between your hand grip and leg wrap.

### Error: Allowing opponent to stack directly over your hips
- **Consequence**: Creates significant spinal pressure and compromises lasso effectiveness by forcing your leg wrap to open. Stack position neutralizes sweep angles and can lead to guard pass.
- **Correction**: As opponent drives forward, immediately shift hips off the centerline to create angles. Use free leg to frame against their hip or shoulder to prevent direct stacking pressure. Consider inverted positions or technical stand-up to escape stack.
- **Recognition**: If you feel pressure driving straight down your spine with nowhere to move, you've been stacked. Prevent this by moving laterally before stack fully establishes.

### Error: Over-committing to single attack without chaining
- **Consequence**: Predictable offense allows opponent to prepare specific defense and counter, leading to failed attacks and potential guard pass when you're committed to single technique.
- **Correction**: Chain attacks fluidly—if sweep is defended, transition to back take; if back take is stopped, switch to triangle or omoplata. Keep opponent guessing by threatening multiple vectors simultaneously.
- **Recognition**: If you find yourself repeatedly attempting the same failed sweep, you're over-committed. Each attack should flow naturally into 2-3 alternatives.

### Error: Poor management of free leg distance
- **Consequence**: Free leg too close allows opponent to collapse distance and smash pass; too far reduces your ability to control hip and execute sweeps. Poor distance management leaves you vulnerable to various passing sequences.
- **Correction**: Use free leg actively to manage optimal distance—close enough to threaten and control, far enough to prevent smashing. Adjust constantly based on opponent's passing pressure and attempts.
- **Recognition**: If opponent easily collapses on you or you can't reach their body with your free leg, your distance is wrong. Should feel controlled spacing that you can adjust.

### Error: Neglecting collar or secondary grips
- **Consequence**: Without posture-breaking grips, opponent can maintain strong posture and defensive base, making sweeps ineffective and reducing submission opportunities. Lasso alone is insufficient for high-level offense.
- **Correction**: Always maintain secondary control—collar grip, belt grip, or pants grip on opposite side to break posture and create angles. Use collar grip to pull opponent down and break their structure.
- **Recognition**: If opponent maintains upright, comfortable posture despite your lasso, you lack proper secondary grips. Their head should be pulled down, posture broken.

### Error: Failing to recognize when to abandon lasso
- **Consequence**: Stubbornly maintaining compromised lasso leads to guard pass as opponent clears the control. Missing transition opportunities to other guards or positions results in defensive position.
- **Correction**: Develop sensitivity to recognize when lasso is being effectively countered—when this happens, immediately flow to spider guard, De La Riva, or other open guard variations. Lasso is a tool, not a dogma.
- **Recognition**: If you're fighting hard to maintain lasso but it's clearly breaking down, it's time to transition. Should feel smooth transitions rather than desperate holds.

## Training Drills

### Drill 1: Lasso Entry and Maintenance Flow
Start in open guard and practice threading your leg through opponent's arm to establish lasso, then focus on maintaining control while opponent attempts gentle extraction (25% resistance). Progress to 50% and 75% resistance where partner actively tries to clear lasso using various methods (posturing, grip breaking, leg weaving). Focus on maintaining sleeve grip integrity, adjusting hip angles to preserve lasso, and immediate recovery when lasso is broken. 3 minutes per round, 4-5 rounds per session, switching partners to experience different body types and clearing strategies.

### Drill 2: Lasso Attack Chains
With lasso established (start from established position), practice flowing between sweep attempts, back takes, and submissions based on partner's defensive reactions (start 0% resistance for pattern learning). Partner gradually increases resistance (50%, 75%, 100% live), forcing you to adapt and chain attacks organically. Focus on reading defensive cues—if they prevent sweep, immediately transition to back take; if they defend back, attack triangle or omoplata. Emphasize smooth transitions between techniques rather than force. 5 minute rounds, 3-4 rounds, with brief coaching breaks to identify missed opportunities.

### Drill 3: Lasso vs. Common Passing Sequences
Partner attempts specific passing sequences against your lasso: stack pass, leg weave pass, smash pass, and posture/distance pass (start 50% speed/power). Your goal is to use lasso to shut down each passing attempt and counter with appropriate sweep or submission. Partner increases to 75%, then 90% intensity as your defenses improve. Focus on recognizing pass type early, adjusting lasso control and hip angles to counter specifically, and exploiting opponent's commitment with well-timed attacks. 2 minutes per passing style, 3 rounds of each style, with rest between to discuss what worked and what didn't.

### Drill 4: Dynamic Hip Movement Patterns
Solo drill and partner drill: Practice circular hip movements, angle changes, and distance management while maintaining lasso control. Solo: Use grappling dummy or resistance band to simulate lasso while performing hip escapes, angle changes, and hip circles. Partner: Establish lasso while partner maintains static top position, then practice moving your hips in all directions while preserving lasso integrity. Progress to partner adding movement and pressure (25%, 50%, 75%). Focus on fluidity, maintaining balance, and constant adjustment rather than static holding. 3 sets of 2 minutes solo, followed by 3 sets of 2 minutes with partner at increasing resistance.

### Drill 5: Lasso Guard Position Sparring
Start every round with lasso guard established, then free spar with goal of sweeping, submitting, or taking back (you), or passing guard (partner). Partner begins at 50% resistance to allow you to work techniques, progressing to 75%, then 100% live rolling. Reset to lasso guard after each successful action (sweep, pass, submission attempt). Focus on implementing all learned principles: grip maintenance, hip movement, attack chains, distance management, and transition timing. 5 minute rounds, 4-5 rounds per session, with coaching feedback between rounds to identify patterns and improvement areas.

## Optimal Submission Paths

**Fastest path to submission** (direct attack):
[[Lasso Guard Bottom]] → [[Omoplata]] → [[Omoplata Control]] → [[Won by Submission]]
*Reasoning: When opponent commits to passing with forward pressure, direct omoplata entry is available and fast. Success depends on opponent's immediate response and your speed of execution.*

**High-percentage path** (systematic):
[[Lasso Guard Bottom]] → [[Omoplata Sweep]] → [[Side Control Top]] → [[Armbar from Side Control]] → [[Won by Submission]]
*Reasoning: Using omoplata threat to generate sweep creates dominant position first, then submitting from top has higher success rates. More reliable against skilled opponents who defend direct submissions.*

**Alternative submission path** (triangle variation):
[[Lasso Guard Bottom]] → [[Triangle Choke]] → [[Triangle Control]] → [[Armbar Finish]] → [[Won by Submission]]
*Reasoning: When opponent's posture is broken and they defend omoplata, bringing leg over for triangle creates submission opportunity. Can finish triangle or transition to armbar from triangle control.*

**Back take to submission path** (positional dominance):
[[Lasso Guard Bottom]] → [[Back Take from Lasso]] → [[Back Control]] → [[Rear Naked Choke]] → [[Won by Submission]]
*Reasoning: Lasso control creates excellent back take opportunities through inversion or technical stand-up. Taking back provides highest percentage submissions in BJJ.*

**Sweep to dominance path** (traditional approach):
[[Lasso Guard Bottom]] → [[Lasso Sweep]] → [[Mount]] → [[Mount Submissions]] → [[Won by Submission]]
*Reasoning: Classic lasso sweep to mount provides excellent position for submission chains. Mount offers multiple submission options with high control and success rates.*
