# Reverse Half Guard Top
#bjj #state #guard #halfguard #top #passing

## State Properties
- **State ID**: S275
- **Point Value**: 2 (Advantage position, passing sequence initiated)
- **Position Type**: Offensive
- **Risk Level**: Medium
- **Energy Cost**: Medium
- **Time Sustainability**: Medium

## State Description

Reverse Half Guard Top occurs when the passer has successfully circled behind the bottom player's half guard, trapping their leg from behind. This advantageous position offers multiple high-percentage passing options, including back takes and leg drag passes. The reverse orientation disrupts the bottom player's traditional half guard defensive structure, making it difficult for them to recover their frames and underhooks. This position is particularly effective because it neutralizes many common half guard escapes and sweeps.

The reverse half guard top position represents a critical moment in passing sequences where the top player has gained a positional advantage but must consolidate it quickly before the bottom player can recover their guard structure.

## Visual Description

You are positioned on top with your chest oriented toward the bottom player's hips and legs, having circled behind their half guard structure. Your trapped leg is behind their half guard entanglement, with your hips angled away from their face. The opponent's legs are still trapping one of your legs, but from behind rather than in front, severely limiting their defensive capabilities. Your upper body is typically positioned toward their lower body, with one arm controlling their far hip or far leg and the other hand controlling their near leg or establishing grips. Your free leg is posted for base and mobility, while your trapped leg works to extract and complete the pass. The opponent is on their side or partially inverted, struggling to face you and regain their guard structure. This geometric configuration creates a dominant angle where traditional half guard defenses and sweeps become ineffective, and the path to back control or completed passes is significantly shorter.

## Key Principles

- **Maintain Chest Pressure**: Keep constant pressure toward opponent's hips
- **Control the Hips**: Dominate hip positioning to prevent re-guard
- **Quick Decision Making**: This position is transitional - capitalize immediately
- **Prevent Facing**: Don't allow opponent to turn and face you
- **Leg Extraction Priority**: Work methodically to free your trapped leg
- **Back Take Awareness**: Constantly threaten back control to freeze opponent
- **Crossface from Behind**: Control head from the reverse angle

## Offensive Transitions

From this position, you can execute:

### Passes
- [[Back Step Pass]] → [[Side Control Top]] (Success Rate: Beginner 60%, Intermediate 75%, Advanced 90%)
  - Complete the pass by extracting leg and establishing side control

- [[Leg Drag Pass]] → [[Leg Drag Position]] (Success Rate: Beginner 55%, Intermediate 70%, Advanced 85%)
  - Control near leg and drag across body to complete pass

- [[Reverse Half Guard Pass]] → [[Side Control Top]] (Success Rate: Beginner 55%, Intermediate 70%, Advanced 85%)
  - Methodical extraction and consolidation to side control

### Back Takes
- [[Backstep to Back Take]] → [[Back Control]] (Success Rate: Beginner 50%, Intermediate 65%, Advanced 80%)
  - Step over and secure back control from reverse orientation

- [[Crab Ride Entry]] → [[Crab Ride]] (Success Rate: Beginner 45%, Intermediate 60%, Advanced 75%)
  - Transition to crab ride control position

### Position Improvements
- [[Flatten and Crossface]] → [[Flattened Half Guard]] (Success Rate: Beginner 60%, Intermediate 75%, Advanced 85%)
  - Control opponent's upper body to neutralize escapes

## Defensive Responses

When opponent has this position against you (bottom player perspective):

- [[Invert and Face]] → [[Half Guard Bottom]] (Success Rate: 45%)
  - Re-establish facing and guard structure through inversion

- [[Reverse to Knees]] → [[Turtle Position]] (Success Rate: 40%)
  - Turn to knees to escape the reverse control

- [[Deep Half Recovery]] → [[Deep Half Guard]] (Success Rate: 35%)
  - Dive under for deep half guard position

- [[Leg Extraction]] → [[Open Guard]] (Success Rate: 30%)
  - Extract leg and recover open guard structure

## Decision Tree

**If** opponent attempts to face you:
- Execute [[Crossface and Flatten]] → [[Flattened Half Guard]] (Probability: 75%)
  - Reasoning: Prevent defensive recovery by controlling head

**Else if** opponent's far leg is accessible:
- Execute [[Back Step Pass]] → [[Side Control Top]] (Probability: 80%)
  - Reasoning: Clear path to completed pass with leg control

**Else if** opponent inverts or turns to knees:
- Execute [[Backstep to Back Take]] → [[Back Control]] (Probability: 70%)
  - Reasoning: Follow opponent's movement to back position

**Else** (opponent attempts to recover half guard):
- Execute [[Leg Drag Pass]] → [[Side Control Top]] (Probability: 65%)
  - Reasoning: Use their recovery attempt to drag leg and pass

## Expert Insights

**John Danaher**: "Reverse half guard represents a critical asymmetry in positional warfare. The bottom player's defensive structure is fundamentally compromised when their opponent achieves the reverse angle. The key is recognizing this position as a transitional state that demands immediate action - either to back control or completed pass. Hesitation allows the bottom player to recover their frames and re-establish facing, which negates your positional advantage."

**Gordon Ryan**: "In competition, I actively seek the reverse half guard through backstep movements because it creates such a dominant passing angle. Once you get here, the opponent is effectively choosing between giving up their back or being passed. The psychological pressure is immense because every movement they make to defend one threat opens the other. I typically prefer the back take from this position as it scores more points and leads to submissions."

**Eddie Bravo**: "The reverse half guard is one of the worst positions for the lockdown player because it neutralizes the leg entanglement advantage. From the 10th Planet perspective, we teach aggressive inversion and knee recovery to escape this position before the pass is completed. If you're on top, this is your opportunity to finish the pass immediately - don't give them time to work their defensive systems."

## Common Errors

### Error: Allowing opponent to face you
- **Consequence**: Opponent regains their defensive frames and half guard structure, negating your positional advantage and allowing them to re-establish their sweep and submission threats
- **Correction**: Immediately establish crossface control from behind and maintain chest pressure toward their hips. Use your weight to prevent rotation and keep them facing away
- **Recognition**: If opponent is able to turn their chest toward you and establish frames, you've lost the reverse angle advantage

### Error: Staying static in this transitional position
- **Consequence**: This position is inherently unstable and favors movement - staying static allows opponent time to identify escape routes and recover their guard structure
- **Correction**: Immediately choose either back take or pass completion and commit to that action. This is a decision point, not a control position
- **Recognition**: If you find yourself holding this position for more than 3-5 seconds without advancing, you're being too passive

### Error: Neglecting to control opponent's hips
- **Consequence**: Opponent can create space, shrimp away, and recover their half guard position or escape to open guard
- **Correction**: Maintain constant hip-to-hip pressure and control the far hip with your hand to prevent escape
- **Recognition**: Feeling opponent create space or distance between your bodies indicates insufficient hip control

### Error: Poor base and balance leading to sweep vulnerability
- **Consequence**: Opponent can use their legs to off-balance you or create scrambling situations that negate your advantage
- **Correction**: Keep your free leg posted wide for base and maintain your center of gravity over your base of support
- **Recognition**: Feeling unstable or wobbly indicates poor base structure

### Error: Overcommitting to leg extraction without position control
- **Consequence**: Focusing solely on freeing your leg without controlling upper body allows opponent to escape or sweep
- **Correction**: First establish upper body control (crossface, hip control), then work leg extraction methodically
- **Recognition**: If opponent is able to create frames or sweep attempts while you work leg extraction, you prioritized incorrectly

## Training Drills

### Drill 1: Backstep Entry and Pass Completion
Start from traditional half guard top position. Practice the backstep motion to achieve reverse half guard, then immediately complete the pass to side control. Partner offers 25% resistance initially, progressing to 75% resistance. Focus on smooth transitioning and maintaining base during the backstep. Repeat 10 repetitions per side, emphasizing speed and decisiveness. Common errors include telegraphing the backstep and poor base during transition.

### Drill 2: Back Take from Reverse Half Guard
Starting in established reverse half guard top, practice identifying the moment to transition to back control. Partner attempts to face you while you work to secure hooks and establish back control. Begin with cooperative partner, then add progressive resistance. Focus on timing the backstep as opponent attempts to turn. 8 repetitions per side, varying opponent's defensive reactions.

### Drill 3: Reverse Half Guard Response Simulation
Partner establishes reverse half guard top while you (bottom player) work defensive escapes. Alternate between inversion recovery, deep half entries, and knee recovery attempts. This drill develops both offensive consolidation and defensive escape understanding. 5 minutes continuous flow with role switching every minute.
