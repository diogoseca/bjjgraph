# Darce Control Position
#bjj #state #control #submission #choke

## State Properties
- **State ID**: S077
- **Point Value**: 3 (Strong control with submission threat)
- **Position Type**: Controlling/Submission position
- **Risk Level**: Medium
- **Energy Cost**: Medium
- **Time Sustainability**: Short to Medium

## State Description
The Darce Control Position is a specialized submission control position where one practitioner has established a darce choke configuration, typically with an arm threaded under the opponent's neck and over their trapped arm, forming an arm triangle using the opponent's own shoulder against their carotid artery. This position is most commonly entered from turtle, front headlock, or scramble situations. The Darce Control offers exceptional finishing potential but requires precise positioning and timing to secure the tap. Unlike static positions, the darce often involves dynamic adjustments and rolling movements to tighten the choke and prevent escape.

### Visual Description
You are positioned perpendicular or at a diagonal angle to your opponent, with one of your arms threaded deeply under their neck and over their near-side arm, creating an arm triangle configuration where your bicep presses against one side of their neck while their own shoulder is driven into the other side. Your free hand reaches around to grip your own bicep or wrist, completing the locked arm triangle structure, while your head and chest apply pressure to drive your shoulder into their neck. Your body weight is distributed to control their upper body, often with your hips sprawled back and your legs spread wide for base and pressure, preventing them from turning into you or rolling away. The opponent is typically on their side or in a defensive turtle position, with their head trapped and one arm isolated within your arm triangle, severely restricting their breathing and blood flow as you adjust your angle and squeeze to finish the choke.

## Key Principles
- Thread arm deep under neck with shoulder wedge
- Create tight arm triangle using opponent's shoulder
- Maintain perpendicular or diagonal body positioning
- Drive shoulder pressure into carotid artery
- Control opponent's body to prevent turning
- Adjust angles dynamically to tighten choke
- Sprawl hips and use body weight for pressure

## Prerequisites
- Understanding of arm triangle choke mechanics
- Familiarity with front headlock and turtle positions
- Recognition of darce entry opportunities
- Knowledge of shoulder pressure application

## State Invariants
- Arm threaded under opponent's neck and over their arm
- Arm triangle configuration established
- Shoulder pressure applied to neck
- Opponent's movement severely restricted
- Perpendicular or diagonal body positioning maintained

- [[Transition to North-South Choke]] → [[North-South]] (if position is compromised)

## Expert Insights
- **John Danaher**: "The darce choke is a highly mechanical submission that relies on proper arm threading depth and shoulder pressure. The key principle is creating a complete arm triangle where the opponent's own shoulder acts as one side of the choke while your arm creates the other side. Most failures occur from insufficient depth on the initial arm threading or poor shoulder pressure application. The choke should feel tight immediately upon locking the position."
- **Gordon Ryan**: "In no-gi competition, the darce is one of my highest percentage submissions because it can be hit from multiple positions and doesn't require the gi for control. I look for darce opportunities constantly when opponents give me front headlock position or turtle. The critical detail is driving my shoulder into their neck aggressively while maintaining the arm triangle structure. I often use rolling movements to improve the angle when the choke isn't tight."
- **Eddie Bravo**: "The darce integrates perfectly with the 10th Planet system, particularly when opponents defend the truck position or twister entries. I emphasize the importance of the arm threading depth and using the head to drive pressure. The darce can be hit from unexpected angles, and I teach students to recognize the 'darce window' when the opponent's arm is isolated and their neck is exposed. Rolling darces and modified entries create submission opportunities that catch people by surprise."

## Common Errors
- **Error**: Insufficient shoulder pressure
  - **Consequence**: Allows opponent to create space and extract their head, compromising the choke.
  - **Correction**: Drive your shoulder into their neck aggressively while maintaining tight arm positioning around their neck and arm.
- **Error**: Loose arm triangle formation
  - **Consequence**: Reduces choking pressure and allows defensive breathing room, making the submission ineffective.
  - **Correction**: Keep your bicep tight against one side of their neck while their own shoulder presses the other side, creating a complete triangle.
- **Error**: Poor body positioning
  - **Consequence**: Weakens control and allows opponent to turn into you or escape, losing the dominant angle.
  - **Correction**: Maintain perpendicular or diagonal positioning to their body, keeping your weight distributed to prevent their movement.
- **Error**: Premature finishing attempt
  - **Consequence**: Leads to lost position as rushing the finish creates escape opportunities.
  - **Correction**: Secure all control points first, then methodically tighten the choke by adjusting angle and squeezing systematically.
- **Error**: Incorrect arm threading
  - **Consequence**: Prevents proper choke mechanics, as shallow or misaligned arm threading fails to trap the neck effectively.
  - **Correction**: Thread your arm deep under their neck, ensuring your shoulder wedges firmly against their throat before locking the position.

## Training Drills
- **Darce Entry from Turtle**: Practice entering darce control from turtle top position with progressive resistance, focusing on proper arm threading depth and timing.
- **Rolling Darce Refinement**: Drill rolling darce movements to improve angle and tightness, learning to maintain control during dynamic adjustments.
- **Darce Finishing Sequence**: Work on systematic tightening of the darce choke from established control, focusing on shoulder pressure and body positioning.
- **Scramble Darce Recognition**: Practice recognizing and capitalizing on darce opportunities during live scrambles and transitions.
- **Darce Defense and Re-attack**: Train against common darce defenses, learning to maintain position and adjust to finish despite resistance.

Transition path:
[[Darce Control Position]] → [[Darce to Back Take]] → [[Back Control]] → [[Rear Naked Choke]] → [[Won by Submission]]

Alternative choke path:

## Computer Science Analogy
The Darce Control Position functions as a time-critical constraint satisfaction problem in the BJJ state graph, where multiple variables (arm depth, shoulder pressure, body angle, opponent resistance) must be optimized within a limited timeframe before the opponent escapes. It represents a highly unstable but high-reward state, similar to a race condition in concurrent programming, where proper sequencing and timing of adjustments determine whether the submission succeeds or the position is lost.
