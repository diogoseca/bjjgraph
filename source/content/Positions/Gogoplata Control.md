## State Description
Gogoplata Control is a specialized submission position originating from the Rubber Guard system, popularized within Eddie Bravo's 10th Planet Jiu-Jitsu. This position involves controlling the opponent with a shin positioned across their throat while maintaining wrist control and positional dominance. Unlike more common submissions, the Gogoplata uses the shin rather than the arms to create choking pressure, making it particularly effective when the opponent's defensive focus is on hand fighting. The position represents an advanced control point in the Rubber Guard progression, typically evolving from the New York Control or Williams Guard positions. When properly established, the Gogoplata Control creates a dominant attacking position with high submission potential while limiting the opponent's defensive options.

## Key Principles
- Establish and maintain shin placement across opponent's throat
- Control opponent's wrist/arm to prevent defense
- Create and sustain optimal choking angle
- Maintain proper hip positioning to maximize pressure
- Apply synchronized control through multiple connection points
- Prevent opponent from creating defensive frames
- Manage energy expenditure through efficient tension application
- Coordinate shin pressure with postural control

## Prerequisites
- Exceptional hip and hamstring flexibility
- Strong Rubber Guard foundation
- Understanding of Mission Control and New York positions
- Knowledge of proper shoulder and neck alignment
- Ability to maintain multiple control points simultaneously

## State Invariants
- Practitioner's shin positioned across opponent's throat
- Opponent's arm trapped and controlled
- Practitioner's foot secured behind opponent's head/neck
- Opponent's posture compromised
- Wrist control established with opposite-side hand
- Hip positioning optimized for pressure application

## Defensive Responses (When Opponent Has This State)
- [[Posture and Frame]] → [[Throat Clearance]]
- [[Grip Breaking]] → [[Wrist Liberation]]
- [[Head Pull Back]] → [[Space Creation]]
- [[Forward Pressure]] → [[Stack Escape]]
- [[Arm Block]] → [[Shin Displacement]]

## Offensive Transitions (Available From This State)
- [[Gogoplata Finish]] → [[Won by Submission]]
- [[Transition to Omoplata]] → [[Omoplata Control]]
- [[Williams Guard Recovery]] → [[Williams Guard]]
- [[Sweep to Mount]] → [[Mount]]
- [[Gogoplata to Triangle]] → [[Triangle Control]]
- [[Return to New York]] → [[New York Control]]

## Counter Transitions
- [[Re-establish Gogoplata]] → [[Gogoplata Control]] (against defense attempts)
- [[Switch to Omoplata]] → [[Omoplata Control]] (if shin position is compromised)
- [[Return to Rubber Guard]] → [[Rubber Guard]] (under significant pressure)

## Expert Insights
- **Danaher System**: While not a position emphasized in the Danaher system, acknowledges its effectiveness as a specialized attack for practitioners with appropriate flexibility. When analyzing the position, focuses on understanding the mechanical principles that make it effective, particularly the leverage created through the shin placement and how it differs from arm-based chokes in terms of defensive resistance.
- **Gordon Ryan**: Rarely employs the Gogoplata in his own game but recognizes its utility in specialized contexts. When addressing defenses against the position, emphasizes preventative measures during the setup phase, focusing on maintaining posture and hand fighting before the shin is fully secured across the throat.
- **Eddie Bravo**: As the primary developer and proponent of the Gogoplata within his 10th Planet system, considers it one of the signature submissions of the Rubber Guard progression. Emphasizes precise technical details like shin angle, foot positioning behind the head, and coordinated pressure application that maximize effectiveness while minimizing energy expenditure. Has developed a systematic approach to establishing and maintaining the position, with specific responses to common defensive reactions.

## Common Errors
- Insufficient hip flexibility → Limited shin placement
- Poor wrist control → Defensive escape opportunity
- Inadequate foot lock behind head → Position instability
- Incorrect shin angle → Reduced choking effectiveness
- Overreliance on flexibility → Structural weakness
- Premature finish attempts → Position compromise

## Training Drills
- Gogoplata Control entry and maintenance against progressive resistance
- Transition flows between Rubber Guard positions and Gogoplata Control
- Flexibility development specifically for Gogoplata mechanics
- Wrist control variations and hand fighting scenarios
- Defensive recognition and counter drills
- Energy management under high-flexibility demands

## Decision Tree
If opponent attempts to create space with posture:
- Execute [[Gogoplata Finish]] or [[Sweep to Mount]]

Else if opponent breaks wrist control:
- Execute [[Return to New York]] or [[Williams Guard Recovery]]

Else if opponent stacks with forward pressure:
- Execute [[Transition to Omoplata]] or [[Gogoplata to Triangle]]

Else if optimal control is established:
- Execute [[Gogoplata Finish]]

## Position Metrics
- Success Rate: 65% control effectiveness (practitioner data)
- Average Time in Position: 15-40 seconds
- Submission Probability: 50%
- Transition Probability: 40%
- Position Loss Probability: 30%

## Optimal Paths
Primary submission path:
[[Rubber Guard]] → [[Mission Control]] → [[New York Control]] → [[Gogoplata Setup]] → [[Gogoplata Control]] → [[Won by Submission]]

Alternative path via Williams:
[[Rubber Guard]] → [[Mission Control]] → [[Williams Guard]] → [[Gogoplata Setup]] → [[Gogoplata Control]] → [[Won by Submission]]

## Historical Context
The Gogoplata gained prominence in modern BJJ and MMA through the 10th Planet system, though variations of the technique have existed in traditional Japanese jiu-jitsu. The technique reached broader recognition when Shinya Aoki successfully applied it in high-profile MMA competitions, and Nick Diaz famously used it to defeat Takanori Gomi (though the result was later overturned). Within the 10th Planet system, Eddie Bravo refined the mechanics and integration of the Gogoplata, establishing it as a central submission option within the Rubber Guard progression. The position exemplifies the evolution of BJJ technique development, where traditional principles are applied through innovative mechanical configurations.

## Computer Science Analogy
The Gogoplata Control functions as a "specialized constraint satisfaction problem" in the BJJ state machine, where multiple physical variables (shin position, wrist control, hip angle, foot placement) must be simultaneously optimized to create an effective submission state. This implements a form of "dependency injection" where the practitioner substitutes a shin-based control structure for the more common arm-based control mechanisms, creating a novel solution to the submission problem. The position exemplifies a "polymorphic implementation" of choking mechanics, where the same fundamental goal (restricting blood flow) is achieved through an alternative execution pathway that bypasses common defensive expectations.
