# Overhook Control Position
#bjj #state #control #overhook #whizzer

## State Properties
- **State ID**: S212
- **Point Value**: 0-2 (Varies by specific application)
- **Position Type**: Controlling/Offensive
- **Risk Level**: Medium
- **Energy Cost**: Medium to High
- **Time Sustainability**: Short to Medium

## State Description
Overhook Control Position, also known as the whizzer, is a fundamental control mechanism where one practitioner controls their opponent's arm by hooking over it from above, typically wrapping their arm over the opponent's arm and gripping behind their back, shoulder, or their own wrist. This control appears in numerous contexts including wrestling positions, turtle top, front headlock scenarios, and as a counter to underhook attempts. The overhook serves both offensive purposes (setting up submissions and back takes) and defensive purposes (preventing opponent's attacks and creating separation).

The versatility of the overhook makes it one of the most important control concepts across all grappling arts. While often viewed as a wrestling technique, modern BJJ has integrated overhook control into sophisticated submission chains and positional systems. Understanding when to maintain the overhook versus when to transition from it represents a key tactical decision point in high-level grappling.

## Visual Description

The controlling practitioner's arm wraps over the top of the opponent's extended or reaching arm, with their armpit positioned over the opponent's shoulder. The grip typically secures behind the opponent's back at waist or shoulder blade level, or in a figure-four configuration with their own wrist. Their body positioning varies by context: from standing, they may be square or angled; from turtle top or side positions, they may be perpendicular or parallel. The key mechanical feature is the downward pressure applied through the overhook, forcing the opponent's arm upward and backward into a compromised position. The opponent's overhooked arm is trapped in an elevated position, limiting their ability to generate power or change levels. The controlling player's free arm typically controls the opponent's head, establishes additional grips, or prepares submissions. The configuration creates a mechanical advantage where the controller uses leverage to keep the opponent's structure broken while setting up attacks or preventing their offensive attempts.

## Key Principles
- **Tight Connection**: Keep armpit sealed tightly over opponent's shoulder, no gap
- **Downward Pressure**: Constantly drive their arm upward and backward, breaking their structure
- **Hip Connection**: Maintain close hip position to prevent opponent from circling away
- **Head Control**: Often combine overhook with head control for complete dominance
- **Weight Distribution**: Use body weight to reinforce overhook control
- **Transition Readiness**: Be prepared to capitalize when opponent attempts to escape

## Prerequisites
- Opponent has extended arm (reaching for underhook, posting, or in compromised position)
- Understanding of leverage and angle creation
- Ability to maintain tight connections while mobile
- Recognition of submission opportunities from overhook

## Expert Insights
- **John Danaher**: "The overhook represents one of the fundamental control mechanisms in grappling. What makes it special is its dual nature - it simultaneously prevents the opponent from attacking effectively while creating offensive opportunities for you. The key is understanding that the overhook is rarely a finishing position itself; rather, it's a gateway to superior positions and submissions. When you have the overhook, you're essentially holding a steering wheel that guides the opponent into increasingly bad positions."

- **Gordon Ryan**: "I use the overhook primarily as a pathway to the Darce and arm triangle in no-gi. When someone shoots for an underhook and I get the whizzer, I'm immediately thinking about how to get my free arm around their neck. The overhook isolates their near arm, which is exactly what I need for front headlock chokes. In the gi, the Kimura from overhook is money - people give you that arm when they're desperate to fight for position."

- **Eddie Bravo**: "The whizzer is huge in 10th Planet system, especially from turtle top and rubber guard transitions. What people don't realize is that the overhook creates a perfect pathway to the crucifix if you know how to roll them. We also use it to set up the truck position. The overhook is like having one arm in a cage - they can't really do anything with it, so now it's a one-armed fight and you're winning."

## Common Errors

### Error: Loose overhook with gap between armpit and opponent's shoulder
- **Consequence**: Opponent can easily circle their arm out or limp-arm escape. Gap allows them to generate power and change their angle. No real control is established, making subsequent attacks impossible to set up effectively.
- **Correction**: Seal your armpit completely over their shoulder like a vice. Your armpit should be glued to their shoulder with zero space. This tight connection is what creates the control - the grip behind their back is secondary to the armpit seal.
- **Recognition**: If opponent can easily pull their arm back through or rotate their shoulder, your overhook has too much space.

### Error: Static overhook without advancing position or attacking
- **Consequence**: Opponent finds ways to neutralize the control through patience, hip movement, or by establishing secondary controls. Holding without attacking gives them time to solve the problem and escape. Energy is wasted maintaining a stalemate.
- **Correction**: Immediately begin working toward submissions (Kimura, Darce, Anaconda), back takes, or positional improvements. The overhook is transitional - use it within 3-5 seconds to advance. Create constant pressure toward your attacking goals.
- **Recognition**: If you're holding an overhook for more than 5-10 seconds without progressing, you're being too passive. Opponent will start feeling comfortable.

### Error: Failing to control opponent's head or hips
- **Consequence**: Even with good overhook, opponent can create distance or change angles if their head and hips are free. They can circle away from the overhook side, stand up, or establish their own controls. Single-point control is insufficient.
- **Correction**: Combine overhook with head control (using free hand to control head/neck) or hip control (using leg positioning or body weight). The overhook works best as part of a multi-point control system. Head and hips are the steering wheels.
- **Recognition**: If opponent is mobile and circling despite your overhook, you lack secondary control points.

### Error: Standing too upright or giving opponent underhooks
- **Consequence**: From standing, upright posture with overhook allows opponent to get under your center of gravity and execute trips or throws using your overhook against you. Their hips get lower than yours, neutralizing your leverage advantage.
- **Correction**: Maintain lower hip position than opponent when using overhook from standing. Keep your hips back and weight distributed properly. Don't let them get underneath you. If needed, use overhook to break them down to knees rather than staying standing.
- **Recognition**: If opponent successfully throws or sweeps you while you have the overhook, your hip position was too high.

### Error: Gripping too shallow behind opponent's back
- **Consequence**: Shallow grip provides insufficient leverage to control their arm effectively. Opponent can posture up, create separation, or simply power through your weak grip. The overhook becomes cosmetic rather than functional.
- **Correction**: Grip deep behind their back at shoulder blade level or below. In figure-four configuration, your wrist should be grabbed with palm facing you, creating maximum leverage. Think about trying to touch your own hip with your grip - the deeper the better.
- **Recognition**: If opponent can easily posture or lift their arm despite your overhook, your grip is too shallow and lacks leverage.

## Training Drills

### Drill 1: Overhook Control Maintenance
Partner starts with overhook established from various positions (turtle top, side position, standing). Bottom person attempts to escape the overhook using various methods (limp arm, circle away, posture) at progressive resistance (50%, 75%, 90%). Top person maintains tight overhook while advancing position. 3-minute rounds. Focus: Maintaining armpit seal, adjusting grip as opponent moves, using body weight to reinforce control, recognizing escape attempts early.

### Drill 2: Overhook to Submission Chains
Establish overhook control. Practice transitioning between different submissions: Kimura (adjusting grip and angle), Darce (getting free arm around neck), Anaconda (opposite side neck attack), Arm Triangle (driving opponent flat). Start at 50% resistance, progress to 75%. 5-minute rounds alternating. Focus: Smooth transitions between submission attempts, maintaining overhook throughout, reading opponent's defensive posture to select best attack.

### Drill 3: Overhook Back Take Progressions
From various overhook positions (turtle top, side, standing), practice different back take entries. Basic climb over shoulder, rolling back take when they drive forward, and tactical back takes when they turn. Begin at 25% resistance, build to 80%. 4-minute rounds. Focus: Using overhook to steer opponent, timing the climb, maintaining control during transition, securing both hooks after taking back.

### Drill 4: Whizzer vs Underhook Battle
Start in scramble position where both players are fighting for inside control. One player tries to secure underhook, other counters with whizzer/overhook. When whizzer is secured, that player works to capitalize for 20 seconds, then reset. Progress from specific starting position to free scrambles. 5-minute rounds. Focus: Recognizing overhook opportunities, beating opponent to inside position, capitalizing quickly when control is achieved.

### Drill 5: Overhook Defense Scenarios
Partner establishes strong overhook from various positions. Defending player must escape the overhook using different methods and timing. After successful escape, note which method worked and why, then reset with overhook reestablished. Moderate resistance (60-70%). 3-minute rounds. Focus: Understanding escape mechanics (limp arm timing, circling direction, posture), recognizing when overhook is vulnerable, not panicking when caught in overhook.

## Related Positions
- [[Kimura Control Position]] - Direct submission path from overhook grip
- [[Darce Control]] - Front headlock submission using overhook to isolate arm
- [[Front Headlock]] - Often combined with overhook for complete control
- [[Turtle Top]] - Common position where overhook control is applied
- [[Crucifix Position]] - Advanced position accessible via overhook when opponent is turtled
- [[Back Control]] - Target position when using overhook to climb to back
- [[Anaconda Control]] - Alternative front headlock choke from overhook

## Optimal Submission Paths

**Fastest path to submission** (direct attack):
[[Overhook Control Position]] → [[Darce Choke]] → [[Won by Submission]]
*Reasoning: Darce is immediately available when overhook isolates near arm and free hand can circle neck. Quick finish if opponent doesn't defend neck properly.*

**High-percentage path** (control first):
[[Overhook Control Position]] → [[Back Take from Overhook]] → [[Back Control]] → [[Rear Naked Choke]] → [[Won by Submission]]
*Reasoning: Using overhook to climb to back is highly reliable, and back control offers best submission percentage. More systematic than direct submission attempts.*

**Alternative submission path** (arm lock):
[[Overhook Control Position]] → [[Kimura from Overhook]] → [[Kimura Control Position]] → [[Won by Submission]]
*Reasoning: Kimura grip is natural evolution of overhook position. High percentage when opponent is focused on escaping overhook rather than defending shoulder.*

**Positional dominance path** (systematic):
[[Overhook Control Position]] → [[Turtle Control]] → [[Turtle Top]] → [[Back Take]] → [[Back Control]] → [[Rear Naked Choke]] → [[Won by Submission]]
*Reasoning: Using overhook to control turtle position, then systematically taking back. Most reliable path when opponent turtles defensively.*

## Decision Tree

**If** opponent tries to circle away from overhook:
- Execute [[Back Take from Overhook]] → [[Back Control]] (Probability: 70%)
  - Reasoning: Circling motion exposes their back, follow their movement to climb
- Or Execute [[Kimura from Overhook]] → [[Kimura Control Position]] (Probability: 60%)
  - Reasoning: Circling makes their arm structure vulnerable to Kimura attack

**Else if** opponent drops level and drives forward:
- Execute [[Darce Choke]] → [[Darce Control]] (Probability: 65%)
  - Reasoning: Forward drive puts their head in perfect position for Darce setup
- Or Execute [[Anaconda Choke]] → [[Anaconda Control]] (Probability: 55%)
  - Reasoning: Low drive exposes neck for anaconda variant

**Else if** opponent turtles or goes to knees:
- Execute [[Crucifix Entry]] → [[Crucifix Position]] (Probability: 60%)
  - Reasoning: Turtle position with overhook creates pathway to crucifix
- Or Execute [[Rolling Back Take]] → [[Back Control]] (Probability: 65%)
  - Reasoning: Roll them over trapped arm to establish back control

**Else if** opponent stands and tries to posture:
- Execute [[Hip Toss]] → [[Side Control Top]] (Success Rate: Beginner 40%, Intermediate 55%, Advanced 68%)
  - Reasoning: Standing posture with overhook is perfect setup for lateral throw
- Or Execute [[Break Down]] → [[Turtle Top]] (Probability: 70%)
  - Reasoning: Use overhook to break their posture and control turtle

**Else** (stalemate position):
- Execute [[Arm Triangle Setup]] → [[Arm Triangle Control]] (Probability: 50%)
  - Reasoning: Force their arm across neck using overhook pressure
- Or Execute [[Maintain and Pressure]] → [[Overhook Control Position]] (Probability: 75%)
  - Reasoning: Keep tight control while creating reactions through pressure
