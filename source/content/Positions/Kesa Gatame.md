## State Properties
- **State ID**: S022
- **Point Value**: 3 (Dominant control position)
- **Position Type**: Pin/control position
- **Risk Level**: Low to Medium
- **Energy Cost**: Low
- **Time Sustainability**: Long

## State Description
Kesa Gatame, often referred to as the "scarf hold" in English, is a powerful side control variation where the top player secures head and arm control while facing the opponent's head rather than their chest. This position offers exceptional control through deliberate weight distribution and leverage, making it one of the most energy-efficient yet controlling pins in grappling. With roots in Judo, Kesa Gatame has been adapted to BJJ with modifications that emphasize control while defending against common BJJ-specific escapes.

## Key Principles
- Secure tight head and arm control
- Distribute weight across opponent's upper chest and face
- Create a wedge with your hip against opponent's armpit
- Maintain low center of gravity with wide base
- Control opponent's near-side arm at all times
- Apply strategic pressure to limit opponent's defensive bridges
- Angle upper body to maximize control and minimize escape lanes

## Prerequisites
- Understanding of weight distribution principles
- Familiarity with head and arm control
- Base and posture management skills
- Recognition of bridge defense patterns

## State Invariants
- Control of opponent's head and one arm
- Top player's body positioned across opponent's upper torso
- Top player facing opponent's head (not chest)
- Wide base with legs spread out
- Hip connectivity with opponent's armpit/side

## Defensive Responses (When Opponent Has This State)
- [[Bridge and Roll]] → [[Guard Recovery]]
- [[Underhook and Turn]] → [[Half Guard Bottom]]
- [[Far Side Frame]] → [[Side Control Escape]]
- [[Far Arm Reach]] → [[Bridge Escape]]
- [[Shrimp and Elbow]] → [[Defensive Position]]

## Offensive Transitions (Available From This State)
- [[Kesa Gatame Arm Lock]] → [[Arm Lock Control]]
- [[Transition to Mount]] → [[Mount]]
- [[Modified Kesa to Side Control]] → [[Side Control]]
- [[Far Side Armbar]] → [[Armbar Control]]
- [[Reverse Kesa Transition]] → [[Reverse Kesa Gatame]]
- [[North-South Transition]] → [[North-South]]
- [[Americana from Kesa]] → [[Americana Control]]
- [[Kata Gatame Entry]] → [[North-South Choke]]

## Counter Transitions
- [[Re-establish Kesa]] → [[Kesa Gatame]] (against escape attempts)
- [[Switch to Side Control]] → [[Side Control]] (if position is compromised)
- [[Knee on Belly Transition]] → [[Knee on Belly]] (if opponent creates space)

## Expert Insights
- **Danaher System**: Views Kesa Gatame as a primarily transitional position rather than a static pin. Emphasizes the importance of anticipating and countering the BJJ-specific defensive responses while using the position primarily to set up arm locks and transitions to more submission-oriented positions.
- **Gordon Ryan**: Uses modified versions of Kesa Gatame, particularly as defensive counters to specific escape attempts from side control. Emphasizes precise weight distribution details that maximize control while maintaining mobility for rapid transitions to more dominant positions.
- **Eddie Bravo**: Has adapted aspects of Kesa Gatame within the 10th Planet system, connecting it to the "Twister Side Control" and specialized submission entries. Focuses less on the traditional head and arm control and more on modified variations that facilitate unique submission paths.

## Common Errors
- Lifting head too high → Space creation underneath
- Insufficient arm control → Vulnerability to underhook escapes
- Narrow base → Susceptibility to being reversed
- Driving force horizontally → Inefficient control mechanism
- Neglecting hip connection → Reduced control effectiveness

## Training Drills
- Kesa maintenance against progressive bridge attempts
- Transition flows between Kesa and related positions
- Grip switching and adjustment exercises
- Pressure sensitivity development
- Counter-response drills to common escape attempts

## Related States
- [[Side Control]] - Related chest-to-chest pin
- [[North-South]] - Related perpendicular pin
- [[Reverse Kesa Gatame]] - Reversed variation of the position
- [[Modified Scarf Hold]] - Variation with under-arm control
- [[Knee on Belly]] - Related transitional control position

## Decision Tree
If opponent bridges strongly:
- Execute [[Hip Switch]] to absorb and redirect force

Else if opponent frames with far-side arm:
- Execute [[Far Side Armbar]] or [[Kesa Gatame Arm Lock]]

Else if opponent attempts to turn away:
- Execute [[Transition to Mount]] or [[North-South Transition]]

Else if opponent creates space with shrimp:
- Execute [[Modified Kesa to Side Control]] to re-establish control

## Position Metrics
- Success Rate: 80% control retention (competition data)
- Average Time in Position: 30-90 seconds
- Submission Probability: 35%
- Transition Advancement Probability: 55%
- Position Loss Probability: 10%

## Optimal Paths
Submission path:
[[Kesa Gatame]] → [[Kesa Gatame Arm Lock]] → [[Won by Submission]]

Positional advancement path:
[[Kesa Gatame]] → [[Transition to Mount]] → [[Mount]] → [[Arm Triangle]] → [[Won by Submission]]

North-South choke path:
[[Kesa Gatame]] → [[North-South Transition]] → [[North-South]] → [[North-South Choke]] → [[Won by Submission]]

## Origins and Evolution
Kesa Gatame originates from traditional Judo where it's considered one of the primary holding techniques (osaekomi-waza). In BJJ, the position has been adapted to account for the increased ground fighting sophistication and escape techniques. The modern BJJ version typically features modifications to the leg position and upper body control that weren't emphasized in the traditional Judo application, creating a hybrid position that maintains the controlling aspects while addressing BJJ-specific defensive concerns.

## Computer Science Analogy
Kesa Gatame functions as an efficient locking mechanism in the BJJ state graph, similar to a mutual exclusion lock (mutex) in concurrent programming. It creates resource exclusivity by controlling critical points (head and arm) while maintaining system stability through proper weight distribution. The position implements redundant control mechanisms that must all be compromised simultaneously for the lock to be released, creating a high-reliability state with excellent fault tolerance against escape attempts.
