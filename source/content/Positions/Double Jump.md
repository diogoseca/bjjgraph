- **Coordination Requirements**: High for managing double underhooks and body positioning
- **Endurance Requirements**: Medium to High for sustained control during resistance

## State Machine Content Elements

### Visual Position Description
Detailed description for clear visualization of the static position:

In the Double Jump position, you are on top of the opponent, typically in a mounted or high side control position, with both of your arms secured under their armpits in a double underhook grip, locking your hands together behind their back to form a tight body lock that controls their upper body and limits their ability to frame or escape. Your chest is pressed heavily against their torso, applying constant downward pressure to pin them to the mat, while your knees are positioned wide to create a stable base, often with one knee near their hip and the other near their shoulder to prevent them from turning or bridging effectively. Your head is tucked low, often on the same side as one of your underhooks, to avoid neck attacks and maintain control, while your hips are slightly elevated to allow for dynamic movement or transitions to submissions. The opponent is flattened on their back, struggling to create space or regain guard, with their arms trapped above your underhooks, rendering them unable to effectively defend or attack, and their legs limited in mobility due to your weight distribution and control.

**Template**: "On top in mount or high side control, secure double underhooks under opponent's armpits, lock hands behind their back for body control. Press chest heavily on their torso, pin them with downward pressure, position knees wide for stable base. Tuck head low to avoid attacks, keep hips elevated for dynamic movement. Opponent is flattened on back, arms trapped, unable to defend or escape effectively."

### Control Points (Numbered List)
Key elements that define the position:
1. **Double Underhook Grip**: Both arms under opponent's armpits, hands locked behind back
2. **Chest Pressure**: Heavy downward force on opponent's torso to pin them
3. **Knee Positioning**: Wide base with knees near hip and shoulder for stability
4. **Head Placement**: Tucked low to protect against neck attacks
5. **Hip Elevation**: Slightly raised hips for mobility and transition options
6. **Opponent Immobilization**: Arms trapped, limited leg movement due to weight

### Strategic Advantages
Benefits of maintaining this position:
- **Total Body Control**: Double underhooks and chest pressure limit opponent's movement
- **Submission Access**: Opens paths to chokes, arm locks, and back takes
- **Escape Prevention**: Wide knee base and body lock thwart guard recovery
- **Transition Flexibility**: Allows shifts to mount, side control, or back control
- **Energy Efficiency**: Can maintain control with moderate effort once established

### Common Challenges
Difficulties faced in this position:
- **Initial Setup**: Achieving double underhooks against defensive opponent
- **Energy Drain**: Sustaining pressure against strong resistance can be taxing
- **Counter Attacks**: Risk of neck attacks if head placement is poor
- **Dynamic Defense**: Opponent may attempt explosive bridges or hip escapes
- **Transition Timing**: Must time submissions or advancements to avoid losing control

## Transition Opportunities

### High-Probability Transitions
Common paths from this position with success rates:
- **To Submission**: [[Rear Naked Choke]] (Success Rate: 70%, Conditions: back exposure)
- **To Submission**: [[Arm Triangle]] (Success Rate: 65%, Conditions: arm isolation)
- **To Position**: [[Back Control]] (Success Rate: 75%, Conditions: opponent turns)
- **To Position**: [[Mount]] (Success Rate: 80%, Conditions: full control)

Format: `[[Target Position/Transition]] (Success Rate: X%, Conditions: [when applicable])`

### Decision Logic for Transitions
```
If [opponent turns] to expose back:
- Attempt [[Back Control]] (Probability: 75%)

Else if [arm isolation] is achieved:
- Attempt [[Arm Triangle]] (Probability: 65%)

Else if [back exposure] is significant:
- Attempt [[Rear Naked Choke]] (Probability: 70%)

Else [maintain control]:
- Transition to [[Mount]] (Probability: 80%)
```

## Defensive Considerations

### Common Threats
Primary risks while in this position:
- **Neck Attack**: Opponent attempts guillotine or headlock → [[Guillotine Control]] (Threat Level: Medium)
- **Bridge Escape**: Opponent bridges explosively to create space → [[Scramble Position]] (Threat Level: Medium)
- **Hip Escape**: Opponent shrimps to regain guard → [[Half Guard Bottom]] (Threat Level: Low)
- **Arm Drag**: Opponent pulls arm to escape underhook → [[Neutral Position]] (Threat Level: Low)

Format: `[[Threat Type]] → [[Resulting Position]] (Threat Level: X)`

### Defensive Strategies
Methods to mitigate threats:
- **Head Protection**: Keep head tucked low and on underhook side to avoid neck attacks
- **Weight Distribution**: Maintain heavy chest pressure to counter bridge attempts
- **Hip Control**: Adjust knee positioning to block hip escapes
- **Grip Maintenance**: Reinforce underhook lock to prevent arm drags
- **Active Adjustments**: Shift body angle or pressure in response to opponent's movements

## Educational Content

### Expert Insights
Commentary as if from recognized authorities:
- **John Danaher**: "Double Jump represents the pinnacle of top control through the use of double underhooks to dominate the opponent's upper body. The key is maintaining relentless chest pressure and a wide base to neutralize their escapes, creating a platform for submissions. This position teaches critical principles of control and pressure that are essential for advanced top game strategies."
- **Gordon Ryan**: "In competition, Double Jump is a devastating control position because it shuts down the opponent's ability to frame or escape. I use it to set up arm triangles or transition to the back by forcing their reactions with my underhooks. The position demonstrates how total body control can lead to high-percentage finishes."
- **Eddie Bravo**: "Double Jump shows how top control can be both dominant and dynamic, integrating well with submission systems to overwhelm opponents. It’s a perfect position for grapplers who like to apply heavy pressure while hunting for chokes or arm locks. This control is ideal for blending classic BJJ with modern submission chains."

Each insight should focus on one key technical or strategic element.
