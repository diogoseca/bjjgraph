## State Properties
- **State ID**: S016
- **Point Value**: 3 (Dominant position)
- **Position Type**: Controlling pin position
- **Risk Level**: Low
- **Energy Cost**: Low
- **Time Sustainability**: Long

## State Description
North-South is a dominant control position where the top player lies perpendicular to the bottom player, with their head positioned near the opponent's hips and their chest applying pressure to the opponent's upper torso. This position offers exceptional control with minimal risk, creating submission opportunities while severely limiting the opponent's mobility and defensive options. North-South serves as both a control position in its own right and as a transitional hub connecting other dominant positions.

## Key Principles
- Apply chest pressure to opponent's face/upper torso
- Maintain low center of gravity with wide base
- Control opponent's arms to prevent defensive frames
- Position head near opponent's hips to eliminate space
- Distribute weight strategically to maximize pressure
- Anticipate and counter escape attempts
- Maintain connection points to prevent space creation

## Prerequisites
- Understanding of weight distribution and pressure
- Ability to control opponent's arms
- Familiarity with proper head positioning
- Recognition of escape attempts

## State Invariants
- Top player positioned perpendicular to bottom player
- Head near opponent's hip line
- Chest pressure on opponent's upper torso
- Wide base with feet spread
- Control of opponent's arm(s)

## Defensive Responses (When Opponent Has This State)
- [[Bridge and Roll]] → [[Guard Recovery]]
- [[Shrimp and Frame]] → [[Half Guard Recovery]]
- [[Turtle Transition]] → [[Turtle Position]]
- [[Arm Underhook]] → [[Side Control Escape]]
- [[Technical Stand-up]] → [[Standing Escape]]

## Offensive Transitions (Available From This State)
- [[North-South Choke]] → [[Won by Submission]]
- [[Kimura from North-South]] → [[Kimura Control]]
- [[Transition to Side Control]] → [[Side Control]]
- [[Transition to Mount]] → [[Mount]]
- [[Armbar from North-South]] → [[Armbar Control]]
- [[Back Take from North-South]] → [[Back Control]]
- [[Reverse Kimura]] → [[Kimura Control]]

## Counter Transitions
- [[Re-establish North-South]] → [[North-South]] (against escape attempts)
- [[Switch to Side Control]] → [[Side Control]] (if position is compromised)
- [[Transition to Kesa Gatame]] → [[Kesa Gatame]] (alternative control)

## Expert Insights
- **Danaher System**: Emphasizes North-South primarily as a transitional position rather than a holding position, focusing on creating dynamic pressure that forces predictable defensive responses. Creates clear systematic connections between North-South and various submission entries, particularly the North-South choke and kimura.
- **Gordon Ryan**: Utilizes North-South frequently as a control position that integrates with his systematic approach to upper body submissions. Emphasizes subtle weight distribution details that maximize control while minimizing energy expenditure, creating a position from which multiple attack vectors can be initiated.
- **Eddie Bravo**: Incorporates North-South into the 10th Planet system with unique control mechanisms focusing on upper body isolation. Often uses the position as an entry point to his specialized submission sequences rather than as a static control position.

## Common Errors
- Lifting head too high → Creating space
- Narrow base → Vulnerability to being rolled
- Insufficient arm control → Allowing defensive frames
- Passive positioning → Missing offensive opportunities
- Poor weight distribution → Reduced pressure effectiveness

## Training Drills
- North-South control maintenance against increasing resistance
- Transition cycles between dominant positions via North-South
- Submission entry sequences from North-South
- Defensive recognition and counter drills
- Pressure sensitivity development exercises

## Related States
- [[Side Control]] - Similar horizontal pin position
- [[Kesa Gatame]] - Related side pin position
- [[Mount]] - Vertical pin position
- [[Reverse North-South]] - Inverted variation
- [[Front Headlock]] - Related upper body control position

## Decision Tree
If opponent bridges strongly:
- Execute [[Float and Return]] → [[North-South]]

Else if opponent turns away:
- Execute [[Back Take from North-South]]

Else if opponent exposes arms:
- Execute [[Kimura from North-South]] or [[Armbar from North-South]]

Else if opponent creates frames:
- Execute [[North-South Choke]]

## Position Metrics
- Success Rate: 85% control retention (competition data)
- Average Time in Position: 30-60 seconds
- Submission Probability: 40%
- Transition Advancement Probability: 55%
- Position Loss Probability: 5%

## Optimal Paths
Primary submission path:
[[North-South]] → [[North-South Choke]] → [[Won by Submission]]

Secondary submission path:
[[North-South]] → [[Kimura from North-South]] → [[Kimura Control]] → [[Won by Submission]]

Positional advancement path:
[[North-South]] → [[Back Take from North-South]] → [[Back Control]] → [[Rear Naked Choke]] → [[Won by Submission]]

## Computer Science Analogy
North-South represents a highly stable node in the BJJ state graph with multiple weighted edges to both dominant positions and submission states. It functions as a "low-energy well" in terms of stability, requiring significant energy input from the opponent to escape from, while providing the controlling player with multiple tactical options. This creates a favorable expected value scenario with high retention probability and multiple offensive branches.
