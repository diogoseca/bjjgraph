# Inverted Guard
#bjj #state #guard #open_guard #modern

## State Properties
- **State ID**: S037
- **Point Value**: 0 (Neutral)
- **Position Type**: Defensive/offensive guard position
- **Risk Level**: Medium to High
- **Energy Cost**: High
- **Time Sustainability**: Short

## State Description
Inverted Guard is a modern guard position where the practitioner turns upside-down, with their back facing the ground and legs positioned upward toward the opponent. This position creates unique angles for controlling the opponent's movement and setting up sweeps, leg entanglements, and back takes. While physically demanding and technically complex, Inverted Guard offers exceptional defensive capabilities through its mobility and creates offensive opportunities that are difficult to counter using traditional passing approaches. This position has become increasingly prominent in modern BJJ competition, particularly in the context of berimbolo sequences and leg entanglement entries.

## Key Principles
- Maintain shoulder and upper back contact with the mat
- Create space through proper framing and leg positioning
- Control opponent's weight and pressure through strategic angles
- Utilize momentum and rotation to create sweep opportunities
- Establish grip controls that facilitate inversions and transitions
- Anticipate and counter passing attempts through dynamic movement
- Develop pathways to more dominant positions like back control

## Prerequisites
- Hip and spine flexibility
- Inverting mechanics
- Spatial awareness while upside-down
- Recognition of entry opportunities
- Understanding of connected positions

## State Invariants
- Practitioner upside-down with back toward the mat
- Legs elevated toward opponent
- Weight distributed on upper back and shoulders
- Dynamic guard retention through rotational movement
- Connection to opponent through legs and/or grips

## Defensive Responses (When Opponent Has This State)
- [[Pressure Passing]] → [[Smash Pass Position]]
- [[Leg Pin Strategy]] → [[Headquarters Position]]
- [[Stack Pressure]] → [[Stack Pass]]
- [[Leg Drag Control]] → [[Leg Drag Position]]
- [[Force Turtle]] → [[Turtle Top]]

## Offensive Transitions (Available From This State)
- [[Berimbolo Entry]] → [[Berimbolo]]
- [[Back Take from Inversion]] → [[Back Control]]
- [[Leg Entanglement]] → [[Single Leg X Guard]]
- [[De La Riva Transition]] → [[De La Riva Guard]]
- [[Reverse De La Riva Guard]] → [[Reverse De La Riva Guard]]
- [[Kiss of the Dragon]] → [[Back Control]]
- [[Crab Ride Transition]] → [[Crab Ride]]
- [[Re-Invert to Guard]] → [[Open Guard Bottom]]

## Counter Transitions
- [[Re-establish Inversion]] → [[Inverted Guard]] (against pass attempts)
- [[Forward Roll Recovery]] → [[Butterfly Guard]] (if position is compromised)
- [[Switch to Half Guard]] → [[Half Guard Bottom]] (under pressure)

## Expert Insights
- **Danaher System**: Views inversion as a transitional movement pattern rather than a static position, emphasizing its role within systematic guard retention mechanics and as an entry pathway to back attacks and leg entanglements. Focuses on the precise biomechanics that maintain safety while creating tactical advantages through unusual angles.
- **Gordon Ryan**: Utilizes inversion primarily as a transitional position within his guard system, particularly as a component of defensive guard retention and as a pathway to his preferred back attack sequences. Emphasizes maintaining defensive integrity throughout the inversion to prevent opportunistic passes.
- **Eddie Bravo**: Has incorporated inversion extensively into his 10th Planet system, developing specialized variations and entries particularly focused on creating pathways to leg entanglements and back attacks. Frequently connects inverted guard to rubber guard transitions and specialized control positions like the "Truck."

## Common Errors
- Insufficient shoulder pressure → Neck strain
- Poor weight distribution → Balance compromise
- Overextension of legs → Vulnerability to passes
- Extended time in position → Energy depletion
- Lack of clear transitional intent → Positional stalling

## Training Drills
- Inversion flow drills with progressive resistance
- Transition practice between inverted guard and related positions
- Specific entry practice from various guards
- Defensive recovery practice against common counters
- Sweep and submission combinations with inversion components

## Related States
- [[Berimbolo]] - Dynamic back-taking technique
- [[De La Riva Guard]] - Common entry position to inversions
- [[Reverse De La Riva Guard]] - Complementary modern guard
- [[Single Leg X Guard]] - Connected leg entanglement
- [[Crab Ride]] - Advanced back-taking control position


## Related Positions

- [[De La Riva Guard]] - Related position
- [[Reverse De La Riva Guard]] - Related position
- [[Single Leg X Guard]] - Related position
- [[Shin-to-Shin Guard]] - Related position
- [[Closed Guard Bottom]] - Related position

## Decision Tree
If opponent stands tall with weight back:
- Execute [[Berimbolo Entry]] or [[Leg Entanglement]]

Else if opponent pressures forward aggressively:
- Execute [[Kiss of the Dragon]] or [[Back Take from Inversion]]

Else if opponent attempts to pin legs:
- Execute [[Re-Invert to Guard]] or [[De La Riva Transition]]

Else if opponent tries to circle around legs:
- Execute [[Reverse De La Riva Guard]] or [[Crab Ride Transition]]

## Position Metrics
- Success Rate: 60% defensive effectiveness (competition data)
- Average Time in Position: 5-15 seconds
- Transition Probability: 75%
- Sweep Probability: 40%
- Back Take Probability: 35%
- Position Loss Probability: 30%

## Optimal Paths
Back-taking path:
[[Inverted Guard]] → [[Berimbolo Entry]] → [[Berimbolo]] → [[Back Control]] → [[Rear Naked Choke]] → [[Won by Submission]]

Leg entanglement path:
[[Inverted Guard]] → [[Leg Entanglement]] → [[Single Leg X Guard]] → [[Ashi Garami]] → [[Inside Heel Hook]] → [[Won by Submission]]

Direct back take path:
[[Inverted Guard]] → [[Kiss of the Dragon]] → [[Back Control]] → [[Rear Naked Choke]] → [[Won by Submission]]

## Computer Science Analogy
The Inverted Guard represents a "state transformation function" in the BJJ state graph that inverts the conventional spatial relationship between practitioners, creating a non-standard orientation that disrupts typical decision-making algorithms. This creates a dynamic optimization problem where the inverted player operates with a different geometric frame of reference, similar to coordinate system transformations in computational geometry. The inversion creates unique attack vectors by altering the typical spatial constraints, enabling transitions that might be infeasible from conventional orientations.
