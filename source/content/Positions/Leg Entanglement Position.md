## State Description

Leg Entanglement Position refers to the general category of positions where one or both practitioners have control over their opponent's leg through various configurations of leg hooks, wraps, and triangle formations. This encompasses positions like [[Ashi Garami]], [[50-50 Guard]], [[Inside Ashi Garami]] (Honey Hole), [[Outside Ashi Garami]], and [[Single Leg X Guard]]. Leg entanglements provide offensive control enabling submissions targeting the ankle, knee, and hip joints while simultaneously limiting opponent mobility.

The position is characterized by asymmetric or symmetric leg control where the attacking practitioner uses their legs to isolate and control the opponent's leg, preventing escape while creating submission opportunities. Modern leg entanglement systems have revolutionized BJJ competition, particularly in no-gi formats, through systematic approaches developed by John Danaher and his students.

From a strategic perspective, leg entanglements create dilemmas where the defender must choose between various defensive options, each opening different attack pathways. The position balances offense and risk, as both practitioners may have leg lock opportunities depending on the specific entanglement configuration.

### Visual Description

You are typically on your side or seated, facing your opponent, with one or both of their legs controlled through various configurations of your legs creating hooks, triangles, or pinches. Your legs work together to isolate their leg from defensive resources, with your inside leg often hooking over their thigh or knee while your outside leg controls their ankle, foot, or lower leg. Your hips maintain strong connection to their leg, creating pressure that restricts rotation and escape while establishing angles for submissions. Your upper body may be controlling their posture, hands, or gi to prevent defensive hand fighting or standing escapes.

The spatial relationship is characterized by close leg-to-leg contact with your body angled to create optimal leverage for leg attacks while maintaining defensive awareness of your own leg positioning. Control mechanisms include leg pressure, hip connection, and angle creation that together restrict opponent movement significantly.

## Key Principles

- **Leg isolation through systematic control** - Separate opponent's leg from their defensive structure
- **Hip connection maintains control** - Strong hip pressure prevents rotation and escape
- **Angle creation enables submissions** - Proper body positioning exposes target joints
- **Systematic advancement to dominant positions** - Progress through leg entanglement hierarchy
- **Upper body control neutralizes defenses** - Control hands and posture to limit counters
- **Defensive awareness of own legs** - Maintain protection against counter leg attacks

- Or Execute [[Kneebar Entry]] → [[Kneebar Position]] (Probability: 35%)

## Expert Insights

**John Danaher**: Views leg entanglements as a systematic hierarchy where each position has specific offensive capabilities and defensive vulnerabilities. Emphasizes methodical advancement from standard Ashi Garami to more dominant Inside Ashi (Saddle/Honey Hole) before attempting high-risk attacks like heel hooks. Teaches leg entanglements as part of comprehensive lower body control system where position hierarchy mirrors upper body positional dominance. The key is understanding that not all leg entanglements are equal - inside positions with heel exposure are significantly more dominant than standard Ashi Garami.

**Gordon Ryan**: Uses leg entanglements as primary offensive weapons in both gi and no-gi, often quickly advancing from initial leg capture to dominant positions. Emphasizes upper body control alongside leg entanglement to neutralize defensive hand fighting that could enable escapes. Views leg entanglement game as positional rather than submission-focused - secure dominant leg entanglement first, then submissions become inevitable. Competition success comes from making opponents choose between defending position or defending submission, with both options leading to offensive opportunities.

**Eddie Bravo**: Incorporated leg entanglements into 10th Planet system through positions like the Honey Hole (Inside Ashi) and unique transitions from traditional guard positions. Focuses on creative entries to leg entanglements from unconventional setups including Lockdown, Truck, and Twister positions. Emphasizes building systems where leg attacks integrate seamlessly with 10th Planet's existing framework, creating multi-threat offensive games where opponents must defend both traditional upper body attacks and modern leg attacks.

## Common Errors

### Error: Poor Hip Connection
- **Consequence**: Allows opponent to pull leg free, rotate out, or create space for escape, dramatically reducing control effectiveness
- **Correction**: Maintain constant hip pressure against opponent's leg, keeping your hips tight and aligned to restrict all rotational movement
- **Recognition**: If opponent's leg feels loose or they can move freely, hip connection is insufficient

### Error: Focusing on Submission Before Control
- **Consequence**: Rushing to submission attempts compromises positional control, allowing escapes and reducing finishing percentage
- **Correction**: Establish dominant leg entanglement position first (Inside Ashi, Saddle), then attempt submissions from secure control
- **Recognition**: If submissions repeatedly fail or opponent escapes during attempts, position is not sufficiently secured

### Error: Neglecting Upper Body Control
- **Consequence**: Opponent uses hands to defend leg attacks, break grips, or establish counters to your leg entanglement
- **Correction**: Control opponent's hands, posture, or gi with your upper body to neutralize defensive capabilities
- **Recognition**: If opponent consistently defends with hand fighting, upper body control is lacking

### Error: Improper Angle for Submissions
- **Consequence**: Submission attempts become ineffective due to poor leverage, opponent can defend more easily
- **Correction**: Adjust body angle to create optimal pressure vectors - typically angling back or to side to expose target joint
- **Recognition**: If submissions feel weak or require excessive force, angle is likely incorrect

### Error: Defensive Ignorance of Own Legs
- **Consequence**: Opponent establishes counter leg entanglements, creating dangerous situations where both have leg attacks available
- **Correction**: Maintain awareness of your own leg positioning, keep free leg defensive and ready to counter opponent's leg attacks
- **Recognition**: If opponent frequently counters with their own leg entanglements, your defensive awareness needs improvement

## Training Drills

### Drill 1: Leg Entanglement Entry Chains
Practice entering leg entanglements from various positions (guard, standing, scrambles) with partner providing 0-50% resistance. Focus on clean entries, immediate hip connection, and proper leg configuration. Progress through 5-10 entries per 2-minute round, emphasizing different entry methods. Success metric: Clean entry with immediate control 80%+ of attempts.

### Drill 2: Position Progression Cycles
Start in standard Ashi Garami, flow through progression to Inside Ashi → Saddle → Back to Ashi → 50-50 → Outside Ashi → return to Ashi. Partner provides positional resistance but no submission attempts. Perform 3-5 complete cycles per 3-minute round. Develops transitional fluidity and positional understanding across leg entanglement hierarchy.

### Drill 3: Submission Setups from Control
Establish dominant leg entanglement (Inside Ashi or Saddle), set up submission to 70-80% completion, release and reset. Partner taps at appropriate pressure level. Repeat with different submissions (heel hook setup, kneebar setup, toe hold setup). Emphasizes control before finishing and develops submission sensitivity without injury risk.

### Drill 4: Defensive Escape Practice
Partner establishes leg entanglement, you practice escape sequences (leg extraction, rotation, standing escape). Partner maintains control but allows escape execution. Perform 5-8 escape attempts per 2-minute round from different leg entanglement positions. Builds defensive awareness and escape technical ability.

### Drill 5: Live Positional Sparring
Start in leg entanglement position (alternating who has control), 3-minute rounds. Goal: Maintain or improve position, finish submissions, or escape to neutral. Full resistance. Integrates all elements in realistic context while building positional instincts and submission timing.

## Related Positions

- [[Ashi Garami]] (S009) - Standard leg entanglement, foundation position
- [[Inside Ashi Garami]] - Dominant leg entanglement with inside heel control
- [[50-50 Guard]] - Mutual leg entanglement position
- [[Saddle Position]] - Most dominant leg entanglement for heel hooks
- [[Single Leg X Guard]] - Precursor leg entanglement position
- [[Outside Ashi Garami]] - Modified leg entanglement with outside control

## Optimal Submission Paths

**Fastest path to submission** (IBJJF legal):
[[Leg Entanglement Position]] → [[Straight Footlock]] → [[Won by Submission]]
*Reasoning: Footlock is IBJJF legal at all belts from this position, direct attack with good success rate*

**High-percentage path** (No-gi/submission-only):
[[Leg Entanglement Position]] → [[Inside Ashi Garami Entry]] → [[Heel Hook Setup]] → [[Won by Submission]]
*Reasoning: Inside Ashi provides superior control and heel hook is highest percentage leg submission when legal*

**Systematic progression path** (Danaher approach):
[[Leg Entanglement Position]] → [[Saddle Position]] → [[Inside Heel Hook]] → [[Won by Submission]]
*Reasoning: Saddle is most dominant leg entanglement, provides maximum control before attempting heel hook*

**Alternative path** (kneebar focus):
[[Leg Entanglement Position]] → [[Kneebar Entry]] → [[Kneebar Control]] → [[Won by Submission]]
*Reasoning: Kneebar available from various leg entanglement configurations, good option when heel is defended*

## Timing Considerations

**Best Times to Enter**:
- When opponent's leg is isolated during guard passing attempts
- During scrambles when opponent's base is compromised
- After successful guard pull when opponent's leg is vulnerable
- When opponent stands in your guard

**Best Times to Attack**:
- When opponent is flat and controlled, minimizing escape options
- After opponent makes defensive commitment (turning in or away)
- When upper body control neutralizes hand fighting
- When opponent is fatigued and defensive awareness decreases

**Vulnerable Moments**:
- During initial entry before hip connection is established
- When transitioning between leg entanglement variations
- If opponent secures counter leg entanglement
- When attempting submission before control is fully secured

**Fatigue Factors**:
- Maintaining leg entanglement requires sustained hip pressure and leg tension
- Extended time in position causes hip flexor and hamstring fatigue
- Attacking submissions repeatedly without success drains energy
- Defensive escaping from leg entanglements is highly energy-intensive

## Competition Considerations

**Point Scoring**: Typically scores 0 points in IBJJF as neutral position, though control time may score advantages. ADCC awards 2 points for opponent's leg exposure leading to entanglement.

**Time Management**: Can maintain position with relatively low energy expenditure while hunting submissions, making it viable for time-based strategy.

**Rule Set Adaptations**:
- IBJJF: Focus on footlocks and kneebars (legal), avoid heel hooks below brown belt
- ADCC: Full leg attack game including heel hooks legal, high-percentage strategy
- Submission-only: Leg entanglements become primary offensive system due to submission emphasis

**Competition Strategy**: Leg entanglements offer high submission rate in formats allowing heel hooks, making them dominant competition strategy for elite no-gi competitors. Time management consideration - can hold position while hunting finish.

## Safety Considerations

Leg entanglements carry significant injury risk, particularly heel hooks and kneebars. Practitioners must:
- Understand proper mechanics and injury potential
- Respect tap signals immediately
- Apply submissions progressively in training (3-5 seconds minimum)
- Know competition rule restrictions for belt level
- Practice escapes to develop defensive awareness
- Never "crank" or "spike" leg attacks explosively
- Build technical understanding before live application

Ankle and knee injuries from improperly applied leg attacks can sideline training for months. Safety requires technical knowledge, controlled application, and mutual respect between training partners.

## Historical Context

Leg entanglements have roots in traditional Japanese Jiu-Jitsu, Judo, and catch wrestling, but were de-emphasized in Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu for decades. The modern resurgence began through competitors like Dean Lister and systematization by John Danaher's "Death Squad" (Gordon Ryan, Gary Tonon, Ethan Crelinsten). Today, leg entanglement systems are core components of elite no-gi competition, dramatically changing meta-game and submission rates.
