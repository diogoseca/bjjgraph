## State Properties

## State Description
Closed Guard Bottom is a foundational BJJ position where the bottom player wraps their legs around the opponent's waist, crossing their ankles behind the opponent's back. While considered neutral in scoring, this position offers significant control and multiple offensive opportunities for the bottom player while providing defensive security.

## Key Principles
- Maintain hip connection to eliminate space
- Control opponent's posture through strategic grips
- Break opponent's posture to set up attacks
- Create angles by shifting hips
- Manage defensive frames to prevent passes
- Threaten multiple attack vectors simultaneously

## Prerequisites
- Proper back position (flat with shoulders on mat)
- Leg conditioning for sustained guard closure
- Hip mobility for creating angles

## State Invariants
- Legs wrapped around opponent's waist with ankles crossed
- Back on the mat
- Opponent contained between your legs

## Defensive Responses (When Opponent Has This State)
- [[Posture and Base]] → [[Standing in Guard]]
- [[Control Arms]] → [[Combat Base]]
- [[Break Grips]] → [[Guard Opening Sequence]]
- [[Create Pressure]] → [[Stack Pass Initiation]]

## Offensive Transitions (Available From This State)
- [[Hip Bump Sweep]] → [[Mount]]
- [[Scissor Sweep]] → [[Mount]] or [[Side Control Top]]
- [[Pendulum Sweep]] → [[Mount]]
- [[Triangle Choke]] → [[Triangle Control]]
- [[Armbar]] → [[Armbar Control]]
- [[Omoplata]] → [[Omoplata Control]]
- [[Kimura]] → [[Kimura Control]]
- [[Cross Collar Choke]] → [[Won by Submission]]
- [[Open Guard Transition]] → [[Open Guard Bottom]]

## Counter Transitions
- [[Re-guard]] → [[Closed Guard Bottom]] (against pass attempts)
- [[Sweep Combination]] → [[Top Position]] (chaining multiple sweeps)
- [[Submission Chain]] → [[Won by Submission]] (linking submission attempts)

## Expert Insights
- **Danaher System**: Emphasizes the "Inside Position Theory" where controlling the inside space is paramount. Focuses on systematically breaking posture and maintaining constant pressure between two primary attack systems - the upper body (triangle/armbar) and lower body (sweeps).
- **Gordon Ryan**: Primarily uses closed guard as a transitional position rather than a home base. When in closed guard, emphasizes creating strong angles and immediately threatening sweeps to force reactions that set up submissions.
- **Eddie Bravo**: Transforms the traditional closed guard into the rubber guard system, focusing on overhook control and "mission control" position to set up gogoplatas, omoplatas, and specialized sweeps. Uses the lockdown from half guard more often than traditional closed guard.

## Common Errors
- Keeping a flat, square position → Easy for opponent to maintain posture
- Focusing on only one attack → Predictable offense
- Loose legs/ankles → Allows opponent space to initiate passes
- Ineffective gripping → Inability to control opponent's posture
- Staying too flat → Limited offensive options

## Training Drills
- Posture breaking sequences with progressive resistance
- Transition chains between submissions
- Hip mobility and angle creation drills
- Defensive to offensive transition flows
- Core strength development for guard retention

## Related States
- [[Open Guard Bottom]] - More dynamic with extended legs
- [[Half Guard Bottom]] - One leg trapped, one leg free
- [[Rubber Guard]] - Specialized closed guard variation (Eddie Bravo)
- [[Williams Guard]] - High closed guard variation (Eddie Bravo)
- [[Butterfly Guard]] - Open guard with hooks under opponent's thighs

## Decision Tree
If opponent establishes strong posture:
- Execute [[Hip Bump Sweep]]

Else if opponent drives forward with pressure:
- Execute [[Pendulum Sweep]]

Else if opponent stands up:
- Transition to [[Open Guard Bottom]]

Else (balanced opponent):
- Break posture and initiate [[Triangle Choke]] or [[Armbar]]
