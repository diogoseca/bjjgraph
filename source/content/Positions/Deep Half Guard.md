# Deep Half Guard
#bjj #state #guard #halfguard #deep_half

## State Properties
- **State ID**: S019
- **Point Value**: 0 (Neutral with offensive advantage)
- **Position Type**: Offensive guard position
- **Risk Level**: Medium
- **Energy Cost**: Medium to High
- **Time Sustainability**: Medium

## State Description
Deep Half Guard is an advanced half guard variation where the bottom player positions themselves underneath one of the opponent's legs, creating a powerful leverage point for sweeps. Unlike traditional half guard where the opponent's leg is trapped between the bottom player's legs, deep half involves the bottom player getting their entire upper body underneath the opponent's center of gravity, often with the shoulder positioned at the opponent's far hip. This position offers exceptional sweeping leverage and is particularly effective for smaller practitioners against larger opponents.

### Visual Description
You are on your back or slightly on your side, positioned deeply underneath the opponent's body, with your upper body and shoulder aligned near their far hip, effectively placing yourself under their center of gravity. Your inside arm often underhooks their trapped leg at the knee or thigh, securing it tightly to maintain control, while your outside arm may control their far-side wrist or arm to prevent defensive framing. Your head is strategically placed against their hip or thigh, acting as a base and leverage point, with your legs framing or ready to push off for sweeps, keeping your hips mobile to create angles. This setup puts the opponent, typically on their knees or attempting to control from top half guard, in a precarious position, struggling to maintain balance as you disrupt their base from underneath, poised to execute powerful sweeps or transitions to dominant positions.

## Key Principles
- Position yourself underneath opponent's center of gravity
- Control opponent's knee/thigh with one arm
- Use your head as a fifth limb for base and leverage
- Maintain connection to opponent's leg throughout movement
- Create and exploit leverage through underhooking position
- Prevent opponent from establishing crossface or head control
- Use hip mobility to create angles and sweep opportunities

## Prerequisites
- Hip mobility and flexibility
- Comfort in inverted or underneath positions
- Understanding of leverage and fulcrum mechanics
- Defensive awareness for counter-attacks

## State Invariants
- Bottom player positioned underneath opponent's leg
- Upper body connection to opponent's far hip/thigh
- Control of opponent's leg with arm and body positioning
- Head positioned strategically for base and leverage
- Active hip movement and positioning

- [[Inversion Escape]] → [[Knee Shield Half Guard]] (under pressure)

## Expert Insights
- **Danaher System**: While not emphasizing deep half as a primary position, acknowledges its utility as part of a comprehensive bottom game. Focuses on the mechanical requirements of proper head positioning and underhook control that make the position effective, particularly the concept of using the head as a "fifth limb" for base and leverage.
- **Gordon Ryan**: Utilizes deep half primarily as a transitional position to set up sweeps or back takes rather than as a home base. Emphasizes the importance of controlling the opponent's far-side arm to prevent defensive framing and crossface pressure.
- **Eddie Bravo**: Has developed specialized variations of the deep half within the 10th Planet system, often connecting it to the lockdown and Electric Chair sweep sequences. Emphasizes unique control points and transition pathways not commonly seen in traditional BJJ.

## Common Errors
- **Error**: Poor head positioning
  - **Consequence**: Leads to vulnerability to flattening, as incorrect head placement allows the opponent to crush your base and control you.
  - **Correction**: Position your head strategically against their hip or thigh, using it as a base and leverage point to maintain structure.
- **Error**: Insufficient control of opponent's leg
  - **Consequence**: Results in loss of leverage, as weak control over their trapped leg diminishes your ability to sweep or transition.
  - **Correction**: Secure a tight underhook on their knee or thigh, maintaining constant connection to control their leg effectively.
- **Error**: Passive hip movement
  - **Consequence**: Causes reduced sweeping power, as immobile hips limit your ability to create angles and generate force for sweeps.
  - **Correction**: Keep your hips active and mobile, constantly adjusting to create leverage and disrupt the opponent's balance.
- **Error**: Neglecting far-side arm control
  - **Consequence**: Leads to vulnerability to crossface, as uncontrolled far-side arm allows the opponent to apply pressure and flatten you.
  - **Correction**: Control their far-side wrist or arm with your outside hand to prevent defensive framing and crossface attempts.
- **Error**: Improper shoulder positioning
  - **Consequence**: Results in ineffective leverage, as misaligned shoulders fail to place you under their center of gravity for sweeps.
  - **Correction**: Align your shoulder near their far hip, ensuring you're positioned deeply underneath to maximize sweeping leverage.

## Training Drills
- **Deep Half Entry**: Practice deep half entry from various positions, focusing on getting underneath the opponent's center of gravity.
- **Sweep Combinations**: Drill sweep combinations with progressive resistance, learning to execute multiple sweeps from deep half.
- **Recovery to Deep Half**: Work on recovery to deep half from pressure, ensuring you can regain the position under duress.
- **Transition Flows**: Engage in transition flows between deep half and related positions like X-Guard or Single Leg X, ensuring smooth movement.
- **Hip Mobility and Leverage**: Train hip mobility and leverage development exercises, enhancing your ability to create angles and sweep effectively.

## Computer Science Analogy
Deep Half Guard functions as a specialized optimization algorithm in the BJJ state graph, leveraging mechanical advantage (the fulcrum principle) to solve the problem of sweeping a potentially heavier opponent. It implements an efficient "leverage multiplier" by positioning the bottom player's body as a fulcrum underneath the opponent's center of gravity, creating a favorable force ratio that enables a smaller force to move a larger mass - similar to how a well-designed algorithm can process large datasets with minimal computational resources.
