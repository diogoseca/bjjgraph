## State Properties

- **Point Value**: 0 (Neutral with offensive advantage)
- **Position Type**: Offensive guard position
- **Risk Level**: Medium
- **Energy Cost**: Medium to High
- **Time Sustainability**: Medium

## State Description
Deep Half Guard is an advanced half guard variation where the bottom player positions themselves underneath one of the opponent's legs, creating a powerful leverage point for sweeps. Unlike traditional half guard where the opponent's leg is trapped between the bottom player's legs, deep half involves the bottom player getting their entire upper body underneath the opponent's center of gravity, often with the shoulder positioned at the opponent's far hip. This position offers exceptional sweeping leverage and is particularly effective for smaller practitioners against larger opponents.

## Key Principles
- Position yourself underneath opponent's center of gravity
- Control opponent's knee/thigh with one arm
- Use your head as a fifth limb for base and leverage
- Maintain connection to opponent's leg throughout movement
- Create and exploit leverage through underhooking position
- Prevent opponent from establishing crossface or head control
- Use hip mobility to create angles and sweep opportunities

## Prerequisites
- Hip mobility and flexibility
- Comfort in inverted or underneath positions
- Understanding of leverage and fulcrum mechanics
- Defensive awareness for counter-attacks

## State Invariants
- Bottom player positioned underneath opponent's leg
- Upper body connection to opponent's far hip/thigh
- Control of opponent's leg with arm and body positioning
- Head positioned strategically for base and leverage
- Active hip movement and positioning

## Defensive Responses (When Opponent Has This State)
- [[Crossface and Back Step]] → [[Reverse Half Guard]]
- [[Limp Leg Escape]] → [[Standing Position]]
- [[Hip Pressure and Control]] → [[Flattened Half Guard]]
- [[Kimura Trap]] → [[Kimura Control]]
- [[Knee Slice from Deep Half]] → [[Knee Cut Position]]

## Offensive Transitions (Available From This State)
- [[Old School Sweep]] → [[Top Position]]
- [[Plan B Sweep]] → [[Top Position]]
- [[Homer Simpson Sweep]] → [[Back Control]]
- [[Waiter Sweep]] → [[Top Position]]
- [[Deep Half to Single Leg X]] → [[Single Leg X Guard]]
- [[Deep Half to X-Guard]] → [[X-Guard]]
- [[Back Door Escape]] → [[Back Control]]
- [[Deep Half to Dogfight]] → [[Dogfight Position]]

## Counter Transitions
- [[Deep Half Recovery]] → [[Deep Half Guard]] (against pass attempts)
- [[Transition to Regular Half]] → [[Half Guard Bottom]] (if position is compromised)
- [[Inversion Escape]] → [[Knee Shield Half Guard]] (under pressure)

## Expert Insights
- **Danaher System**: While not emphasizing deep half as a primary position, acknowledges its utility as part of a comprehensive bottom game. Focuses on the mechanical requirements of proper head positioning and underhook control that make the position effective, particularly the concept of using the head as a "fifth limb" for base and leverage.
- **Gordon Ryan**: Utilizes deep half primarily as a transitional position to set up sweeps or back takes rather than as a home base. Emphasizes the importance of controlling the opponent's far-side arm to prevent defensive framing and crossface pressure.
- **Eddie Bravo**: Has developed specialized variations of the deep half within the 10th Planet system, often connecting it to the lockdown and Electric Chair sweep sequences. Emphasizes unique control points and transition pathways not commonly seen in traditional BJJ.

## Common Errors
- Poor head positioning → Vulnerability to flattening
- Insufficient control of opponent's leg → Loss of leverage
- Passive hip movement → Reduced sweeping power
- Neglecting far-side arm control → Vulnerability to crossface
- Improper shoulder positioning → Ineffective leverage

## Training Drills
- Deep half entry from various positions
- Sweep combinations with progressive resistance
- Recovery to deep half from pressure
- Transition flows between deep half and related positions
- Hip mobility and leverage development exercises

## Related States
- [[Half Guard Bottom]] - Parent position with different mechanics
- [[Single Leg X Guard]] - Related leg control position
- [[X-Guard]] - Advanced guard with similar sweeping principles
- [[Butterfly Half Guard]] - Hybrid position with butterfly hook
- [[Knee Shield Half Guard]] - Alternative defensive half guard

## Decision Tree
If opponent posts with far-side arm:
- Execute [[Old School Sweep]] or [[Plan B Sweep]]

Else if opponent drives weight forward:
- Execute [[Homer Simpson Sweep]] or [[Waiter Sweep]]

Else if opponent attempts to backstep:
- Execute [[Back Door Escape]] → [[Back Control]]

Else if opponent attempts to crossface:
- Execute [[Deep Half to Single Leg X]] or [[Deep Half to X-Guard]]

## Position Metrics
- Success Rate: 75% offensive action (competition data)
- Average Time in Position: 15-45 seconds
- Sweep Probability: 70%
- Back Take Probability: 25%
- Position Loss Probability: 20%

## Optimal Paths
Primary sweeping path:
[[Deep Half Guard]] → [[Old School Sweep]] → [[Top Position]] → [[Side Control]] → dominant position sequence

Back-taking path:
[[Deep Half Guard]] → [[Homer Simpson Sweep]] → [[Back Control]] → [[Rear Naked Choke]] → [[Won by Submission]]

Modern transition path:
[[Deep Half Guard]] → [[Deep Half to Single Leg X]] → [[Single Leg X Guard]] → [[Technical Stand-up Sweep]] → [[Top Position]]

## Computer Science Analogy
Deep Half Guard functions as a specialized optimization algorithm in the BJJ state graph, leveraging mechanical advantage (the fulcrum principle) to solve the problem of sweeping a potentially heavier opponent. It implements an efficient "leverage multiplier" by positioning the bottom player's body as a fulcrum underneath the opponent's center of gravity, creating a favorable force ratio that enables a smaller force to move a larger mass - similar to how a well-designed algorithm can process large datasets with minimal computational resources.
