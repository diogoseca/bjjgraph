## State Description
Twister Control is a highly specialized submission position developed and popularized by Eddie Bravo within his 10th Planet Jiu-Jitsu system. This position involves a complex configuration where the controlling practitioner creates a wrestling-style guillotine/neck crank by controlling the opponent's upper body while simultaneously isolating one of their legs. When properly applied, the submission creates a powerful rotational pressure against the opponent's spine. The position is characterized by controlling the opponent's shoulders perpendicular to the ground while the practitioner lies on their side, with one arm threaded under the opponent's neck and the other arm/hand securing the trapped leg. The Twister combines elements of both a neck crank and spinal lock, making it one of the most technically complex and devastating submissions in BJJ.

## Key Principles
- Establish perpendicular control of opponent's shoulders
- Create proper head/neck connection with threading arm
- Isolate and control opponent's leg to prevent defensive rotation
- Maintain proper body positioning to maximize leverage
- Apply synchronized pressure for effective submission mechanics
- Prevent opponent from creating defensive frames
- Control opponent's potential escape routes through proper grip configuration

## Prerequisites
- Understanding of twister mechanics and application
- Recognition of entry opportunities
- Spinal control mechanics
- Knowledge of proper force application

## State Invariants
- Practitioner lying on side, perpendicular to opponent
- One arm threaded under opponent's neck
- Opponent's leg trapped and controlled
- Opponent's shoulders controlled perpendicular to ground
- Opponent's spine in compromised rotational position

## Defensive Responses (When Opponent Has This State)
- [[Emergency Tap]] → [[Submission Concession]]
- [[Spine Alignment Defense]] → [[Neutral Position]]
- [[Leg Extension]] → [[Leg Entanglement Escape]]
- [[Hip Drive and Bridge]] → [[Scramble Position]]
- [[Roll to Knees]] → [[Turtle Position]]

## Offensive Transitions (Available From This State)
- [[Twister Finish]] → [[Won by Submission]]
- [[Transition to Calf Slicer]] → [[Calf Slicer]]
- [[Banana Split Switch]] → [[Banana Split]]
- [[Twister to Back]] → [[Back Control]]
- [[Switch to Truck]] → [[Truck Position]]
- [[Armbar from Twister]] → [[Armbar Control]]
- [[Twister to Mounted Triangle]] → [[Triangle Control]]
- [[Lateral Press Finish]] → [[Won by Submission]]

## Counter Transitions
- [[Re-establish Twister]] → [[Twister Control]] (against escape attempts)
- [[Switch to Truck]] → [[Truck Position]] (if position is compromised)
- [[Transition to Back Control]] → [[Back Control]] (under pressure)

## Expert Insights
- **Danaher System**: While not a core submission in the Danaher system due to its illegality in certain competition rulesets, acknowledges the twister's mechanical effectiveness when properly applied. Emphasizes the importance of understanding the precise biomechanics that make the submission effective, focusing particularly on the relationship between controlling the shoulders and creating the necessary spinal rotation.
- **Gordon Ryan**: Recognizes the Twister as a specialized submission that can be highly effective in certain scenarios but utilizes it selectively within his overall game. When employing the position, emphasizes the importance of complete control before applying the submission pressure to prevent scrambling opportunities.
- **Eddie Bravo**: As the primary developer and proponent of the Twister in BJJ (adapted from wrestling's guillotine), has created a comprehensive system of entries, controls, and application details. Considers the Twister one of the signature submissions of the 10th Planet system, emphasizing its role as both a devastating submission and a control position that can lead to other attacks.

## Common Errors
- Insufficient shoulder control → Loss of submission mechanics
- Poor neck connection → Reduced leverage
- Inadequate leg control → Defensive mobility
- Premature application of pressure → Escape opportunities
- Improper angle of pressure → Ineffective submission mechanics

## Training Drills
- Twister control position maintenance against progressive resistance
- Entry practice from Truck position and other setups
- Incremental pressure application with controlled feedback
- Transition flows between Twister and related positions
- Proper biomechanical alignment exercises

## Decision Tree
If opponent resists neck pressure:
- Execute [[Lateral Press Finish]] or [[Transition to Calf Slicer]]

Else if opponent attempts to free leg:
- Execute [[Banana Split Switch]] or [[Twister Finish]]

Else if opponent drives hips up:
- Execute [[Twister to Back]] or [[Switch to Truck]]

Else if opponent tucks chin defensively:
- Execute [[Armbar from Twister]] or [[Twister to Mounted Triangle]]

## Position Metrics
- Success Rate: 85% submission when fully established (competition data)
- Average Time in Position: 5-15 seconds
- Submission Probability: 80%
- Counter Vulnerability: 15%
- Position Loss Probability: 10%

## Optimal Paths
Standard finish path:
[[Twister Control]] → [[Twister Finish]] → [[Won by Submission]]

Transition path 1:
[[Twister Control]] → [[Transition to Calf Slicer]] → [[Calf Slicer]] → [[Won by Submission]]

Transition path 2:
[[Twister Control]] → [[Twister to Back]] → [[Back Control]] → [[Rear Naked Choke]] → [[Won by Submission]]

## Historical Context
The Twister was originally adapted from wrestling (where it's known as a guillotine) by Eddie Bravo and integrated into his 10th Planet system in the early 2000s. While initially viewed as an exotic or niche submission, it gained widespread recognition when Chan Sung Jung ("The Korean Zombie") successfully applied it in the UFC in 2011. Its inclusion in some competition rulesets but exclusion from others (due to spinal pressure concerns) has created an interesting competitive context where the technique is sometimes used as a control position leading to other submissions rather than as a finish itself.

## Computer Science Analogy
The Twister Control represents a "deadlock condition" in the BJJ state machine, where multiple physical constraints (shoulder control, neck control, leg isolation) are applied simultaneously to create a terminal state with limited escape possibilities. This implements a form of "resource exhaustion attack" where the defender's movement resources are systematically eliminated through coordinated positional control. The position exemplifies a highly optimized constraint satisfaction problem where the proper alignment of multiple control variables creates a solution state (submission) that is difficult to disrupt once properly established.
