# Knee Slice Position Top
#bjj #state #guard_passing #offensive_position #pressure_passing

## State Properties
- **State ID**: S235
- **Point Value**: 0 (Transitional to 3 points upon completion)
- **Position Type**: Offensive / Guard Passing
- **Risk Level**: Medium
- **Energy Cost**: Medium
- **Time Sustainability**: Medium

## State Description
Knee Slice Position Top is a fundamental guard passing position where you drive your knee across opponent's legs in a slicing motion while maintaining forward pressure and upper body control. This technique creates a wedge that separates opponent's defensive structures, progressively cutting through their guard to establish side control. The knee slice combines elements of pressure passing and mobility, making it one of the most versatile and high-percentage passes in both gi and no-gi BJJ.

The position is characterized by your knee creating a dividing line between opponent's upper and lower body as you move laterally across their guard. Your shin acts as a barrier preventing them from recovering guard while your upper body controls (crossface, underhook, or grips) prevent them from turning into you or escaping. The pass requires proper timing, angle management, and the ability to chain with other passing options when initially defended.

From a strategic standpoint, the knee slice represents a systematic approach to guard passing that works against many guard types including half guard, butterfly guard, and open guard variations. Its effectiveness comes from the multiple control points and the difficulty opponents face trying to both prevent the pass and create offensive opportunities simultaneously.

## Visual Description
You are in a kneeling or low squat position with one knee actively driving across the opponent's torso toward their far hip. Your shin and knee create a wedge between their upper body and legs, with your weight distributed forward to maintain pressure. One arm typically controls their head with a crossface or frames against their shoulder, while your other arm secures an underhook on their far side or controls their near arm. Your opposite leg (non-slicing) is posted for base, usually with knee bent and foot positioned for balance and pressure distribution. The opponent is typically on their back or slightly on their side, with their legs attempting to create frames or hooks to prevent your passing progression. Your hips are heavy and positioned to continue moving laterally past their guard, while your upper body stays connected to prevent space creation.

## Key Principles
- **Knee Pressure and Direction**: Drive knee in slicing motion toward far hip, creating wedge between legs and torso
- **Upper Body Connection**: Maintain crossface or underhook to prevent opponent from turning into you
- **Hip Control**: Keep hips low and heavy to prevent opponent from creating space or recovering guard
- **Base and Balance**: Non-slicing leg provides stable base for pressure and movement
- **Timing and Commitment**: Execute pass with decisive forward pressure rather than tentative movements
- **Guard Type Adaptation**: Adjust knee slice mechanics based on specific guard being passed

## Offensive Transitions
From this position, you can execute:

### Guard Pass Completions
- [[Knee Slice to Side Control]] → [[Side Control]] (Success Rate: Beginner 50%, Intermediate 65%, Advanced 80%)
  - Complete the pass by establishing side control with full hip control

- [[Knee Slice to North-South]] → [[North-South]] (Success Rate: Beginner 40%, Intermediate 55%, Advanced 70%)
  - Continue momentum through to north-south position

- [[Knee Slice to Mount]] → [[Mount]] (Success Rate: Beginner 35%, Intermediate 50%, Advanced 65%)
  - Advanced option: continue past side control directly to mount

### Alternative Passes (When Defended)
- [[Switch to Leg Drag]] → [[Leg Drag Position]] (Success Rate: Beginner 45%, Intermediate 60%, Advanced 75%)
  - If knee slice is blocked, switch to leg drag on same side

- [[Back Step to Back Control]] → [[Back Control]] (Success Rate: Beginner 30%, Intermediate 45%, Advanced 60%)
  - Step around when opponent over-commits to stopping knee slice

- [[Transition to Over-Under]] → [[Over-Under Pass Position]] (Success Rate: Beginner 35%, Intermediate 50%, Advanced 65%)
  - Convert to over-under pass when opponent creates butterfly hooks

### Submissions from Transition
- [[Knee Slice to D'arce]] → [[D'arce Control]] (Success Rate: Beginner 25%, Intermediate 40%, Advanced 55%)
  - Opponent's defensive frames can expose neck for D'arce choke

- [[Knee Slice to Guillotine]] → [[Guillotine Control]] (Success Rate: Beginner 20%, Intermediate 35%, Advanced 50%)
  - If opponent sits up into pass, guillotine becomes available

## Defensive Responses
When opponent attempts to counter your knee slice:

- [[Pressure Through Frames]] → [[Knee Slice Position Top]] (Success Rate: 70%)
  - Maintain pressure and drive through defensive frames

- [[Adjust Angle]] → [[Knee Slice Position Top]] (Success Rate: 65%)
  - Change angle of attack when initial line is blocked

- [[Switch Sides]] → [[Opposite Side Pass]] (Success Rate: 60%)
  - If one side is well-defended, switch to opposite knee slice

- [[Staple Leg]] → [[Knee Slice Position Top]] (Success Rate: 55%)
  - Control opponent's bottom leg to prevent re-guard

## Decision Tree

**If** opponent's guard is open with no knee shield:
- Execute [[Knee Slice to Side Control]] → [[Side Control]] (Probability: 75%)
  - Reasoning: Clear path without major obstacles, direct completion
- Or Execute [[Knee Slice to Mount]] → [[Mount]] (Probability: 55%)
  - Reasoning: Aggressive option to maximize positional advancement

**Else if** opponent establishes knee shield:
- Execute [[Switch to Leg Drag]] → [[Leg Drag Position]] (Probability: 65%)
  - Reasoning: Knee shield blocks direct slice, leg drag capitalizes on their structure
- Or Execute [[Staple Leg]] → [[Knee Slice Position Top]] (Probability: 60%)
  - Reasoning: Pin knee shield to mat and continue slicing motion

**Else if** opponent sits up or creates frames:
- Execute [[Knee Slice to D'arce]] → [[D'arce Control]] (Probability: 50%)
  - Reasoning: Their upper body movement exposes neck for submission
- Or Execute [[Pressure Through Frames]] → [[Knee Slice Position Top]] (Probability: 55%)
  - Reasoning: Maintain passing pressure despite defensive frames

**Else if** opponent attempts to come on top:
- Execute [[Back Step to Back Control]] → [[Back Control]] (Probability: 60%)
  - Reasoning: Use their forward movement to access back position
- Or Execute [[Knee Slice to Guillotine]] → [[Guillotine Control]] (Probability: 45%)
  - Reasoning: Their aggressive defense exposes head and neck

**Else** (balanced defense / default):
- Execute [[Knee Slice to Side Control]] → [[Side Control]] (Probability: 65%)
  - Reasoning: Continue systematic passing with proper technique
- Or Execute [[Transition to Over-Under]] → [[Over-Under Pass Position]] (Probability: 55%)
  - Reasoning: Chain to alternative pass to create multiple problems

## Expert Insights

**John Danaher**: "The knee slice represents one of the most reliable methods for guard passing because it creates a structural problem that's difficult for the opponent to solve without creating other vulnerabilities. The beauty of this pass is in its combination of forward pressure and lateral movement - opponent must defend both vectors simultaneously. The key is understanding that the knee slice isn't just about driving forward; it's about creating an angle that makes their defensive structures collapse. When executed properly, each defensive frame they create actually helps you complete the pass by giving you something to pressure against. The upper body control is equally important as the leg work - never sacrifice head control for leg position."

**Gordon Ryan**: "I use the knee slice constantly because it chains perfectly with other passing options. If they stop my knee slice one way, I immediately have leg drag, back step, or over-under available. This pass-chaining is what makes top-level guard passing work - you're not trying to force one technique, you're creating a sequence where their defense to one pass opens another. The specific mechanics I focus on are keeping my hips heavy and my crossface strong. A lot of people try to knee slice with high hips and lose it because opponent can create space. Stay heavy, stay connected, and be ready to switch passes instantly."

**Eddie Bravo**: "The knee slice fits into our guard passing system at 10th Planet, though we also incorporate a lot of leg drag and headquarters passing. What I teach about knee slice is that your shin becomes a barrier - it's like you're creating a wall that separates their upper body from their legs. Once that wall is in place, they have to choose between defending their upper body (preventing crossface, underhook) or defending their lower body (preventing the actual slice). That choice is what creates the dilemma. We also use knee slice to set up leg locks - if they defend the pass aggressively, sometimes their legs become exposed for ankle locks or knee bars."

## Common Errors

### Error: High Hips During Slice
- **Consequence**: Opponent creates space underneath, recovers guard with knee shield or butterfly hooks, completely negating your passing attempt.
- **Correction**: Keep hips low and heavy throughout the slicing motion. Your weight should be distributed forward onto opponent, not held in reserve above them.
- **Recognition**: If opponent easily gets hooks or frames back in, your hips are too high.

### Error: Weak Crossface or No Upper Body Control
- **Consequence**: Opponent turns into you, establishes upper body frames, and either recovers guard or prevents pass completion.
- **Correction**: Establish strong crossface across their face/neck or secure deep underhook before committing fully to knee slice. Upper body control is as important as leg control.
- **Recognition**: If opponent is looking at you or able to use their arms effectively against your pass, you lack upper body control.

### Error: Slicing Straight Forward Instead of Diagonally
- **Consequence**: Drives directly into opponent's strongest defensive frames rather than creating angle that bypasses their structure.
- **Correction**: Knee slice should move diagonally across their body toward far hip, not straight forward into their chest. Think of drawing a diagonal line with your knee.
- **Recognition**: If pass feels like running into a wall rather than flowing around obstacles, your angle is wrong.

### Error: Stopping Forward Pressure
- **Consequence**: Creates gap that allows opponent to recover guard, especially with knee shield or butterfly hooks.
- **Correction**: Maintain constant forward pressure throughout entire passing sequence. Even momentary pause allows guard recovery.
- **Recognition**: If opponent suddenly has space or hooks back in, you stopped pressuring at critical moment.

### Error: Not Chaining to Alternative Passes
- **Consequence**: Becomes stuck in failed knee slice attempt, wasting energy while opponent becomes comfortable defending.
- **Correction**: If knee slice isn't progressing after 3-5 seconds, immediately switch to leg drag, back step, or over-under pass. Don't force stalled passes.
- **Recognition**: If you're exerting maximum effort without positional improvement, you're forcing instead of flowing.

## Training Drills

### Drill 1: Isolated Knee Slice Mechanics (Technical Repetition)
Partner lies flat with legs extended. Practice knee slice motion focusing on angle, pressure, and control. 10 reps each side, emphasizing clean technique over speed. Progress to partner providing light resistance (25%), then moderate (50%). 5-minute rounds.

### Drill 2: Knee Slice from Half Guard (Positional Drilling)
Start in half guard top. Partner defends at 50% intensity. Focus on establishing underhook, controlling head, and executing knee slice to side control. Reset after each completion or failed attempt. 5-minute rounds, tracking completion percentage.

### Drill 3: Pass Chaining (Flow Drill)
Attempt knee slice, partner defends specific way (knee shield, sit-up, frame, etc.). Immediately chain to appropriate alternative pass (leg drag, back step, over-under). Builds adaptive passing. 6-minute rounds.

### Drill 4: Guard Passing Scrambles (Live Drilling)
Start in various guard positions (butterfly, open, half). Work to establish knee slice under live conditions (70-80% resistance). Focus on timing, explosive entry, and maintaining control through resistance. 4-minute rounds.

### Drill 5: Knee Slice Competition Simulation (High-Intensity Positional)
Start in favorable position for knee slice. Partner provides maximum realistic resistance (90%) using all legal defenses. Work to complete pass and establish control. 3-minute rounds with 1-minute rest, simulating competition exhaustion and pressure.

## Related Positions

- [[Side Control]] - Primary destination from successful knee slice
- [[North-South]] - Alternative pass completion
- [[Leg Drag Position]] - Common transition when knee slice is blocked
- [[Over-Under Pass Position]] - Alternative pass when opponent creates butterfly hooks
- [[Back Control]] - Accessed via back step when opponent over-defends
- [[Half Guard Top]] - Common starting position for knee slice entries
- [[Open Guard Top]] - Another common starting position

## Optimal Submission Paths

**Direct passing path** (gi and no-gi):
[[Knee Slice Position Top]] → [[Knee Slice to Side Control]] → [[Side Control]] → [[Submission Attacks]] → [[Won by Submission]]
*Reasoning: Systematic progression from guard pass to dominant position to submission, maintaining control throughout.*

**Opportunistic submission path**:
[[Knee Slice Position Top]] → [[Knee Slice to D'arce]] → [[D'arce Control]] → [[Won by Submission]]
*Reasoning: Opponent's defensive frames during knee slice often expose neck for D'arce choke, allowing submission during passing sequence.*

**Maximum advancement path**:
[[Knee Slice Position Top]] → [[Knee Slice to Mount]] → [[Mount]] → [[Mount Submissions]] → [[Won by Submission]]
*Reasoning: Aggressive option that bypasses side control for immediate mount, maximizing positional advantage.*

**Back take path**:
[[Knee Slice Position Top]] → [[Back Step to Back Control]] → [[Back Control]] → [[Rear Naked Choke Pathway]] → [[Won by Submission]]
*Reasoning: When opponent over-commits to stopping knee slice, back step provides path to most dominant position.*

**Submission-only path** (no-gi focused):
[[Knee Slice Position Top]] → [[Knee Slice to Guillotine]] → [[Guillotine Control]] → [[Won by Submission]]
*Reasoning: In submission-only formats, taking guillotine during knee slice can be higher percentage than completing pass.*

## Position Metrics
- **Pass Completion Rate**: Beginner 52%, Intermediate 68%, Advanced 82%
- **Transition Success to Alternative Pass**: Beginner 45%, Intermediate 60%, Advanced 75%
- **Submission Opportunity Creation**: Beginner 20%, Intermediate 35%, Advanced 50%
- **Defense Against Guard Recovery**: Beginner 50%, Intermediate 65%, Advanced 80%
- **Average Time to Complete Pass**: 15-45 seconds

## Timing Considerations

**Best Times to Initiate Knee Slice**:
- When opponent's guard is opening or transitioning between types
- After opponent attempts and fails a sweep or submission
- When their knee shield or defensive structures are momentarily compromised
- Early in match when opponent is fresh but potentially less warmed up defensively

**Optimal Pressure Moments**:
- Immediately after establishing crossface or underhook - capitalize on upper body control
- When opponent is flat on back rather than on their side
- After stapling their bottom leg to prevent re-guard

**Vulnerable Moments to Avoid**:
- When opponent has established strong knee shield without first breaking it down
- When your base leg is compromised or swept
- When opponent has deep sleeve or collar grips that can disrupt your posture
- When fatigued and unable to maintain constant forward pressure

**Energy Management**:
- Knee slice requires sustained forward pressure - don't initiate when exhausted
- Medium energy cost means it's sustainable for multiple attempts
- If first attempt fails, reassess rather than forcing repeated attempts that drain energy
- Chain to alternative passes to distribute energy expenditure

## Competition Considerations

**Point Scoring**: Knee slice completion scores 3 points for guard pass in IBJJF and most point-based systems. In ADCC, scores 3 points. Partial completion scores no points - must achieve full side control or equivalent.

**Time Management**: Average completion time of 15-45 seconds makes it viable throughout match. Early in match, can be used aggressively. Late in match when protecting lead, can be used to control pace and time while hunting pass.

**Rule Set Adaptations**:
- **Gi**: Use collar and pants grips for enhanced control, crossface can be tighter with gi material
- **No-Gi**: Focus on underhook and head control, slightly faster execution needed due to less friction
- **IBJJF**: Standard knee slice mechanics work perfectly, emphasize clean pass completion for points
- **ADCC**: Can be more aggressive with back step or submission attempts during pass

**Strategic Applications**: Knee slice is safe, high-percentage pass that works against most guard types, making it ideal for competition where reliability is valued. Chains well with other techniques, providing backup options when initially defended. Works well as part of systematic passing approach rather than isolation technique.

## Historical Context

The knee slice pass has been a fundamental technique in Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu since the art's early development, though its refinement and systematic integration into passing systems is more recent. The technique's effectiveness in both gi and no-gi competition has kept it relevant through BJJ's evolution. Modern practitioners like Bernardo Faria, Lucas Lepri, and Rodolfo Vieira have demonstrated the knee slice's effectiveness at the highest levels of competition, each bringing their own stylistic variations. The pass remains a cornerstone technique taught to beginners while remaining effective at black belt competition level, testament to its fundamental soundness. As guard techniques have evolved, the knee slice has adapted, with practitioners developing specific entries and chains to counter modern open guard systems.

## Safety Considerations

The knee slice is generally a safe technique for both practitioner and opponent. However, be mindful of knee pressure on opponent's body - excessive pressure can cause discomfort or rib issues. When opponent is defending aggressively, ensure your own knee and base leg aren't placed in vulnerable positions for leg lock attacks. Train with control, especially when drilling with less experienced partners. Start slow and build intensity gradually. Respect when partner indicates knee slice pressure is uncomfortable.
