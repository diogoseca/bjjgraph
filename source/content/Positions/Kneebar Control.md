# Kneebar Control
#bjj #state #submission #leglocks #control

## State Properties
- **State ID**: S050
- **Point Value**: 3 (Dominant submission control)
- **Position Type**: Leg entanglement submission position
- **Risk Level**: Low
- **Energy Cost**: Medium
- **Time Sustainability**: Medium

## State Description
Kneebar Control is a specialized submission position where the practitioner isolates and controls the opponent's leg to create hyperextension pressure against the knee joint. Unlike rotational leg locks that attack the ligaments through twisting mechanics, the kneebar applies linear pressure similar to an armbar but targeting the knee joint. The position typically involves the practitioner hugging the opponent's leg while placing their hips against the back of the opponent's knee, creating a fulcrum for the hyperextension. This submission represents one of the fundamental leg attack positions in BJJ and serves as both a primary submission threat and a control position from which other attacks can be launched. In many competition rulesets, the kneebar is restricted to higher belt levels due to its effectiveness and injury potential when applied suddenly.

## Key Principles
- Establish proper leg isolation with opponent's leg fully extended
- Create and maintain perpendicular alignment to opponent's leg
- Apply hips-to-knee connection to establish effective fulcrum
- Control opponent's leg through proper gripping mechanics
- Prevent opponent's rotation and defensive recounter
- Apply controlled, progressive pressure for submission
- Manage opponent's defensive movements through strategic control
- Maintain awareness of transition opportunities

## Prerequisites
- Understanding of proper leg control mechanics
- Recognition of entry opportunities
- Knowledge of knee joint mechanics
- Ability to maintain control against defensive movement
- Awareness of ruleset restrictions

## State Invariants
- Practitioner controlling opponent's isolated leg
- Hips positioned against back of opponent's knee
- Opponent's leg extended across practitioner's body
- Perpendicular alignment to opponent's leg
- Control points established on foot/ankle and upper leg

## Defensive Responses (When Opponent Has This State)
- [[Turn Toward Control]] → [[Leg Rotation Escape]]
- [[Boot Escape]] → [[Leg Slip]]
- [[Hip Elevation]] → [[Pressure Reduction]]
- [[Grip Fighting]] → [[Control Break]]
- [[Roll to Quarters]] → [[Positional Escape]]

## Offensive Transitions (Available From This State)
- [[Kneebar Finish]] → [[Won by Submission]]
- [[Transition to Inside Sankaku]] → [[Inside Sankaku]]
- [[Kneebar to Heel Hook]] → [[Inside Heel Hook]]
- [[Kneebar to Toe Hold]] → [[Toe Hold Control]]
- [[Kneebar to Backside 50/50]] → [[Backside 50/50]]
- [[Hip Heist Transition]] → [[Top Position]]
- [[Saddle Entry]] → [[Inside Sankaku]]
- [[Straight Ankle Lock Switch]] → [[Straight Ankle Lock]]

## Counter Transitions
- [[Re-establish Kneebar]] → [[Kneebar Control]] (against defensive movement)
- [[Switch to Outside Sankaku]] → [[Outside Sankaku]] (if control is compromised)
- [[Transition to 50/50]] → [[50/50 Guard]] (under pressure)

## Expert Insights
- **Danaher System**: Emphasizes the kneebar as both a powerful submission and an essential control position within the leg entanglement system. Focuses on precise mechanical details that maximize control and leverage while minimizing escape opportunities. Particularly emphasizes understanding the relationship between the kneebar and other leg entanglements, viewing it as a component of an integrated attacking system rather than an isolated technique.
- **Gordon Ryan**: Employs the kneebar extensively within his leg attack system, often using it as both a primary submission and a pathway to transition to other leg entanglements. Emphasizes maintaining control throughout transition sequences and recognizing when to commit to the kneebar finish versus transitioning to alternative attacks based on the opponent's defensive reactions.
- **Eddie Bravo**: Has incorporated the kneebar into his 10th Planet system with particular focus on entries from his guard variations and transition sequences from the Truck position. Emphasizes creating dilemmas where defending one submission exposes vulnerability to others, particularly using the kneebar as a component in submission chains.

## Common Errors
- Improper hip positioning → Reduced leverage
- Inadequate leg isolation → Defensive mobility
- Poor perpendicular alignment → Technical inefficiency
- Premature finishing attempt → Escape opportunity
- Neglecting upper body control → Defensive counter
- Inadequate control during transitions → Position loss

## Training Drills
- Kneebar control maintenance against progressive resistance
- Transition flows between kneebar and related positions
- Entry practice from various positions
- Defensive recognition and counter drills
- Connection sensitivity development between control and finish

## Related States
- [[Inside Sankaku]] - Connected leg entanglement
- [[Backside 50/50]] - Related control position
- [[Straight Ankle Lock]] - Related leg submission
- [[Toe Hold Control]] - Complementary leg attack
- [[Inside Heel Hook]] - Common transition option


## Related Positions

- [[Inside Sankaku]] - Related position
- [[Toe Hold Control]] - Related position
- [[Won by Submission]] - Related position
- [[North-South]] - Related position
- [[Side Control]] - Related position

## Decision Tree
If opponent rotates toward control:
- Execute [[Transition to Inside Sankaku]] or [[Kneebar to Heel Hook]]

Else if opponent pushes foot against control:
- Execute [[Kneebar Finish]] or [[Straight Ankle Lock Switch]]

Else if opponent attempts to rotate away:
- Execute [[Kneebar to Backside 50/50]] or [[Saddle Entry]]

Else if opponent elevates hips defensively:
- Execute [[Hip Heist Transition]] or [[Kneebar to Toe Hold]]

## Position Metrics
- Success Rate: 75% submission or advancement when fully established
- Average Time in Position: 10-30 seconds
- Submission Probability: 65%
- Transition Probability: 80%
- Position Loss Probability: 20%

## Optimal Paths
Direct submission path:
[[Kneebar Control]] → [[Kneebar Finish]] → [[Won by Submission]]

Inside Sankaku transition path:
[[Kneebar Control]] → [[Transition to Inside Sankaku]] → [[Inside Sankaku]] → [[Inside Heel Hook]] → [[Won by Submission]]

Toe Hold transition path:
[[Kneebar Control]] → [[Kneebar to Toe Hold]] → [[Toe Hold Control]] → [[Won by Submission]]

## Ruleset Considerations
The legality of kneebars varies significantly across competition rulesets:
- IBJJF: Legal only for brown and black belts in gi, restricted in certain no-gi divisions
- ADCC: Legal in all divisions
- NAGA: Legal in most adult divisions
- EBI: Legal in all divisions
- Self-defense: No restrictions

These ruleset variations create strategic implications for when and how to employ the kneebar in different competitive contexts, affecting both training emphasis and competition application.

## Computer Science Analogy
The Kneebar Control represents a "constraint satisfaction problem" in the BJJ state machine, where multiple physical parameters (leg isolation, hip position, leverage application) must be optimized simultaneously to create an effective submission state. This implements a form of "mechanical advantage algorithm" that transforms defensive resistance into increased submission pressure through proper alignment and fulcrum positioning. The position exemplifies the concept of a "state lock" where, once proper configuration is achieved, the opponent's escape options become progressively more constrained as submission pressure increases, creating a positive feedback loop that accelerates toward the terminal submission state.
