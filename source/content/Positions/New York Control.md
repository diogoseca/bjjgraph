## State Properties
- **State ID**: S053
- **Point Value**: 2 (Advantageous control position)
- **Position Type**: Specialized control guard
- **Risk Level**: Low
- **Energy Cost**: Medium to High
- **Time Sustainability**: Medium

## State Description
New York Control is the second major control position in Eddie Bravo's Rubber Guard progression, representing an advancement from the initial Mission Control position. This position is characterized by the practitioner maintaining closed guard while capturing their own wrist/forearm with their opposite hand after establishing the Mission Control shin grip. This creates a powerful control structure where the opponent's posture is severely compromised through the combined pressure of closed guard, elevated leg, and the locked control grip. New York Control serves as a critical junction point in the Rubber Guard system, setting up direct pathways to various submission attacks (particularly the Gogoplata) and more advanced control positions like Williams Guard. The position offers exceptional upper body control with minimal energy expenditure once properly established.

## Key Principles
- Establish Mission Control before transitioning to New York
- Secure proper wrist/forearm grip with opposite hand
- Maintain elevation of controlling leg against opponent's upper body
- Apply controlled pressure against opponent's posture and shoulder
- Create and maintain proper angle for maximum control
- Prevent opponent from establishing defensive frames
- Manage energy through efficient grip configuration
- Coordinate hip movement with upper body control

## Prerequisites
- Strong Mission Control foundation
- Hip and hamstring flexibility
- Grip strength and endurance
- Understanding of posture control mechanics
- Knowledge of Rubber Guard progression system

## State Invariants
- Closed guard base with opponent inside guard
- One leg elevated across opponent's shoulder/upper back (from Mission Control)
- Same-side hand gripping own shin (from Mission Control)
- Opposite hand securely gripping same-side wrist/forearm
- Opponent's posture severely compromised
- Practitioner's hips engaged and connected to opponent
- Clear pathway to advanced positions and submissions

## Defensive Responses (When Opponent Has This State)
- [[Posture and Stack]] → [[Stack Pressure]]
- [[Two-on-One Wrist Control]] → [[Grip Breaking]]
- [[Forward Pressure]] → [[Guard Breaking]]
- [[Frame Creation]] → [[Space Generation]]
- [[Shoulder Drive]] → [[Defensive Posture]]

## Offensive Transitions (Available From This State)
- [[New York to Gogoplata]] → [[Gogoplata Control]]
- [[New York to Williams]] → [[Williams Guard]]
- [[New York to Omoplata]] → [[Omoplata Control]]
- [[New York Triangle]] → [[Triangle Control]]
- [[New York to Dead Orchard]] → [[Dead Orchard Control]]
- [[Transition to Invisible Collar]] → [[Invisible Collar Position]]
- [[New York Sweep]] → [[Top Position]]
- [[Return to Mission Control]] → [[Mission Control]]

## Counter Transitions
- [[Re-establish New York]] → [[New York Control]] (against defensive movement)
- [[Switch to Standard Guard]] → [[Closed Guard Bottom]] (if control is compromised)
- [[Transition to High Guard]] → [[High Guard]] (alternative control)

## Expert Insights
- **Eddie Bravo**: As the developer of the position, considers New York a critical control point that significantly enhances the control established in Mission Control while opening pathways to the most potent submissions in the Rubber Guard system. Emphasizes the importance of proper angle and grip details that make the position both secure and energy efficient. Views New York as the "decision point" in the Rubber Guard system where practitioners can branch to various attacks based on opponent reactions.
- **Danaher System**: While not a position regularly employed in the Danaher system, acknowledges its mechanical efficiency in creating a severe limitation on the opponent's posture and mobility. When analyzing the position, focuses on understanding the grip structure that creates such effective control with minimal effort once established.
- **Gordon Ryan**: Recognizes the position's effectiveness when properly executed, but emphasizes preventative measures that stop the position from being established in the first place. When addressing defenses, focuses on maintaining strong posture and grip fighting before the control structure is fully locked in.

## Common Errors
- Premature transition from Mission Control → Unstable control
- Improper wrist/forearm grip → Control vulnerability
- Insufficient leg elevation → Reduced pressure
- Poor closed guard maintenance → Base instability
- Overreliance on arm strength → Energy depletion
- Ineffective hip positioning → Suboptimal angle

## Training Drills
- New York entry and control maintenance against progressive resistance
- Transition flows between Mission Control, New York, and subsequent positions
- Grip endurance training for wrist/forearm control
- Flexibility development for optimal leg positioning
- Submission chain drilling from established New York

## Decision Tree
If opponent attempts to posture strongly:
- Execute [[New York to Gogoplata]] or [[New York to Williams]]

Else if opponent drives shoulder forward:
- Execute [[New York to Omoplata]] or [[New York Triangle]]

Else if opponent attempts to frame inside:
- Execute [[New York to Dead Orchard]] or [[Transition to Invisible Collar]]

Else if control becomes compromised:
- Execute [[Return to Mission Control]] or [[New York Sweep]]

## Position Metrics
- Success Rate: 80% control effectiveness (practitioner data)
- Average Time in Position: 20-45 seconds
- Transition Probability: 75%
- Submission Setup Probability: 60%
- Position Loss Probability: 15%

## Optimal Paths
Gogoplata path:
[[New York Control]] → [[New York to Gogoplata]] → [[Gogoplata Control]] → [[Won by Submission]]

Williams Guard path:
[[New York Control]] → [[New York to Williams]] → [[Williams Guard]] → [[Williams Shoulder Lock]] → [[Won by Submission]]

Triangle path:
[[New York Control]] → [[New York Triangle]] → [[Triangle Control]] → [[Triangle Finish]] → [[Won by Submission]]

## Historical Context
New York Control was developed by Eddie Bravo as the second major position in his Rubber Guard system in the early 2000s. The position earned its name as Bravo was refining the system while in New York City. Like other elements of the Rubber Guard, New York Control represented a significant innovation in guard control that didn't rely on gi grips, making it particularly effective for no-gi competition and MMA. The position gained wider recognition when demonstrated in Bravo's instructional materials and competition performances by 10th Planet practitioners, showing its effectiveness against traditional posture-based guard approaches.

## Computer Science Analogy
New York Control functions as a "mutex lock" in the BJJ state machine, where a critical shared resource (the opponent's posture and mobility) is secured with multiple redundant locking mechanisms. This creates a form of "deadlock condition" where the opponent's escape algorithms are systematically prevented from executing. The position exemplifies the concept of "constraint propagation" where establishing specific grip configurations forces cascading limitations on the opponent's action space, progressively restricting their degree of freedom until a terminal state (submission) becomes inevitable.
