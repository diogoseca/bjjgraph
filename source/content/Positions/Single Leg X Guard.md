# Single Leg X Guard
#bjj #state #guard #leg_entanglement #open_guard

## State Properties
- **State ID**: S008
- **Point Value**: 0 (Neutral with offensive advantage)
- **Position Type**: Offensive control position
- **Risk Level**: Medium
- **Energy Cost**: Medium
- **Time Sustainability**: Medium

## State Description
Single Leg X Guard (SLX) is a specialized open guard variation where the bottom player entangles one of the opponent's legs. The bottom player has one leg wrapped around the opponent's trapped leg while the other foot hooks on the opponent's hip or inner thigh. This position offers exceptional control of the opponent's balance and creates powerful sweeping leverage and direct entries to leg lock positions. SLX serves as both a powerful sweeping position and a gateway to the modern leg lock game.

## Visual Description

You are on your back or partially seated with one of your opponent's legs trapped between both of your legs in an X-shaped configuration. Your inside leg wraps around the back of their trapped leg, your foot hooking near their ankle or Achilles tendon, while your outside leg extends upward with your foot placed on their opposite hip or inner thigh. Your opponent stands on one leg above you, their trapped leg elevated and controlled by your leg entanglement, severely compromising their base and balance. Your hands typically grip their pants at the knee or ankle of the trapped leg, or control their belt or upper body for additional off-balancing control. The opponent's free leg bears all their weight as they struggle to maintain balance against your constant off-balancing pressure, their upper body leaning in various directions as they attempt to establish stability or initiate a pass. This configuration creates a powerful lever system where even small movements of your hips and legs can dramatically affect your opponent's balance, making them vulnerable to sweeps while providing direct pathways to leg entanglements for submissions.

## Key Principles
- Control opponent's trapped leg at ankle and knee
- Maintain elevation of opponent's weight
- Create and exploit off-balancing angles
- Use active hooks to destabilize opponent
- Position for either upper body (sweep) or lower body (leg lock) attacks
- Prevent opponent from establishing pressure or base

## Prerequisites
- Hip mobility and hamstring flexibility
- Understanding of leg positioning and control
- Basic sweep mechanics
- Familiarity with leg entanglement concepts

## State Invariants
- One of opponent's legs trapped between your legs
- One of your legs wrapped around opponent's trapped leg (typically at calf/ankle)
- Your other foot hooking opponent's hip or inner thigh
- Control of opponent's weight distribution and balance

## Defensive Responses (When Opponent Has This State)
- [[Base and Pressure]] → [[SLX Escape Sequence]]
- [[Leg Kick Through]] → [[Knee Cut Pass]]
- [[Limp Leg Retreat]] → [[Standing up]]
- [[Pressure and Smash]] → [[Top Pressure Position]]

## Offensive Transitions (Available From This State)
- [[SLX Technical Standup Sweep]] → [[Top Position]]
- [[SLX Push Sweep]] → [[Top Position]]
- [[SLX to X-Guard]] → [[X-Guard]]
- [[SLX to Ashi Garami]] → [[Ashi Garami]]
- [[Sumi Gaeshi from SLX]] → [[Top Position]]
- [[Reverse X Transition]] → [[Reverse X Guard]]
- [[Back Step Counter]] → [[Saddle Position]]

## Counter Transitions
- [[SLX Recomposition]] → [[Single Leg X Guard]] (against escape attempts)
- [[SLX to 50/50]] → [[50-50 Guard]] (against certain counters)
- [[SLX to Butterfly]] → [[Butterfly Guard]] (against smashing pressure)

## Expert Insights
- **Danaher System**: Emphasizes SLX as a key component of the "Lower Body Dilemma" system, viewing it as both a powerful sweeping position and an entry to the leg locking game. Focuses on precise foot positioning and angle creation to maximize control of the opponent's base.
- **Gordon Ryan**: Uses SLX as a primary control position, often utilizing it to force defensive reactions that set up transitions to more dominant leg entanglements like the Inside Sankaku. Emphasizes creating constant back-stepping threats to manipulate opponent movement.
- **Eddie Bravo**: Incorporates SLX within the 10th Planet system, particularly as a transition between the lockdown and the "Honey Hole" (411/saddle) position. Often focuses on upper body controls not traditionally emphasized in SLX.

## Common Errors
- Passive foot positioning → Reduced control and leverage
- Failing to elevate opponent → Vulnerability to smashing pressure
- Inadequate ankle control → Escape opportunities for opponent
- Poor hip positioning → Ineffective sweep mechanics
- Telegraphing leg lock entries → Defensive counters

## Training Drills
- SLX entry from various guards and positions
- Transition flows between SLX and related guards
- Off-balancing cycles with progressive resistance
- Leg elevation and control drills
- Switch-based attack sequences

## Related States
- [[X-Guard]] - Similar leg entanglement with additional leg control
- [[Ashi Garami]] - Leg entanglement focused on submission
- [[Reverse X Guard]] - Inverted variation of leg entanglement
- [[50-50 Guard]] - Mutually entangled leg position
- [[De La Riva Guard]] - Related open guard with exterior leg hook

## Decision Tree
If opponent bases forward:
- Execute [[SLX Push Sweep]]

Else if opponent attempts to limp leg:
- Execute [[SLX to Ashi Garami]] → [[Inside Heel Hook]]

Else if opponent tries to kick through:
- Execute [[SLX to X-Guard]]

Else if opponent stands straight and tall:
- Execute [[SLX Technical Standup Sweep]]

## Position Metrics
- Success Rate: 75% offensive advancement (competition data)
- Average Time in Position: 20-40 seconds
- Sweep Probability: 65%
- Submission Entry Probability: 45%
- Position Loss Probability: 25%

## Optimal Paths
Highest-percentage sweeping path:
[[Single Leg X Guard]] → [[SLX Technical Standup Sweep]] → [[Top Position]] → [[Side Control]] → [[Mount]] → submission chain

Leg lock-oriented path:
[[Single Leg X Guard]] → [[SLX to Ashi Garami]] → [[Inside Heel Hook]] → [[Won by Submission]]

Competition-legal path (IBJJF):
[[Single Leg X Guard]] → [[SLX to X-Guard]] → [[X-Guard Sweep]] → [[Top Position]] → dominant position sequence

## Computer Science Analogy
SLX functions as a decision node with high branch factor in the BJJ state graph. It offers multiple weighted edges to different types of advantageous states (sweeps, leg entanglements), making it an efficient position to invest positional resources in. Its high connectivity to both conventional positional BJJ and the modern leg lock game makes it a versatile vertex in the overall graph structure.
