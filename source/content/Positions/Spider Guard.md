## State Machine Content Elements

### Visual Description
Must include detailed physical positioning that enables clear spatial understanding and visualization:

You are on your back with both feet placed on your opponent's biceps, controlling their sleeves with your hands. Your opponent is kneeling or standing in your open guard, with their arms extended and controlled. Your legs create tension by pushing their arms wide while your grips prevent them from breaking free. Your hips are elevated slightly off the ground, creating a spring-like tension throughout your body that allows for dynamic movement and attacks.

**Template**: "You lie on your back with feet on opponent's biceps, gripping their sleeves. Your opponent kneels with arms extended and controlled. Tension created through arm extension and leg pressure. Dynamic positioning allows for sweeps and transitions."

### Defensive Responses (Available Counter-Actions)
When opponent has this position:
- **Sleeve Break**: Breaking grip connections to neutralize control → [[Open Guard Top]] (Success Rate: 60%)
- **Stack Pressure**: Driving forward to collapse guard structure → [[Guard Pass]] (Success Rate: 45%)
- **Knee Cut Pass**: Circling around extended legs → [[Knee Cut Position]] (Success Rate: 40%)
- **Backward Step**: Creating distance to reset grips → [[Standing Guard]] (Success Rate: 55%)

Format: `[[Technique Name]] → [[Resulting State]] (Success Rate: X%)`

### Offensive Transitions (Available Actions)
From this position:
- **Omoplata Sweep**: Using sleeve control to off-balance → [[Omoplata Control]] (Success Rate: Beginner 35%, Intermediate 55%, Advanced 70%)
- **Tripod Sweep**: Leveraging opponent forward with foot placement → [[Top Position]] (Success Rate: Beginner 40%, Intermediate 60%, Advanced 75%)
- **Triangle Setup**: Bringing leg over for triangle entry → [[Triangle Control]] (Success Rate: Beginner 25%, Intermediate 45%, Advanced 65%)
- **Lasso Transition**: Converting to lasso guard control → [[Lasso Guard]] (Success Rate: Beginner 50%, Intermediate 70%, Advanced 85%)
- **Spider X Sweep**: Using cross-sleeve grip for directional sweep → [[Top Position]] (Success Rate: Beginner 30%, Intermediate 50%, Advanced 70%)
- **Bicep Slicer**: Applying pressure to extended arm → [[Bicep Slicer]] (Success Rate: Beginner 15%, Intermediate 30%, Advanced 50%)

Format: `[[Technique Name]] → [[Resulting State]] (Success Rate: Beginner X%, Intermediate Y%, Advanced Z%)`

## Decision Tree Logic
Structured decision-making logic:
```
If [opponent attempts to stack]:
- Execute [[Omoplata Sweep]] → [[Omoplata Control]] (Probability: 70%)

Else if [opponent postures high]:
- Execute [[Tripod Sweep]] → [[Top Position]] (Probability: 65%)

Else if [opponent leans forward]:
- Execute [[Triangle Setup]] → [[Triangle Control]] (Probability: 55%)

Else [opponent maintains distance]:
- Execute [[Lasso Transition]] → [[Lasso Guard]] (Probability: 75%)
```

## Educational & Commentary Content

### Expert Insights
Commentary as if from recognized authorities for authentic technical analysis:
- **John Danaher**: "Spider guard succeeds through systematic control of distance and angle. The key is maintaining constant tension on the sleeves while using foot placement to manipulate your opponent's balance. The position creates a mechanical disadvantage for the opponent that can be exploited through precise timing and direction changes."
- **Gordon Ryan**: "In competition, spider guard works best as a transition position rather than a holding pattern. I use it to set up specific sweeps and submissions, particularly the omoplata and triangle combinations. The energy cost is high, so efficiency in attacks is crucial for success."
- **Eddie Bravo**: "Spider guard integrates well with rubber guard concepts, particularly when transitioning to high guard positions. The sleeve control creates opportunities for creative attacks and can be combined with lapel work in gi competition for devastating effect."

Each insight should be 2-3 sentences providing specific technical or strategic guidance.

### Common Errors
For technical understanding and education:
- **Error Description**: Gripping too close to the wrists instead of deep sleeve grips
- **Consequence**: Opponent can easily break grips and pass guard
- **Correction**: Secure deep sleeve grips near the elbows for maximum control

- **Error Description**: Placing feet too high on the arms near shoulders
- **Consequence**: Reduces sweep leverage and makes position unstable
- **Correction**: Position feet on biceps for optimal control and sweep mechanics

- **Error Description**: Failing to maintain constant tension on the sleeves
- **Consequence**: Allows opponent to recover posture and initiate passing
- **Correction**: Keep arms extended and create spring-like tension throughout position

- **Error Description**: Staying static instead of constantly attacking
- **Consequence**: High energy cost without offensive progress
- **Correction**: Flow between attacks and use position as transition hub

- **Error Description**: Neglecting hip mobility and staying flat
- **Consequence**: Reduces effectiveness of sweeps and submissions
- **Correction**: Stay mobile with hips elevated and ready to adjust angles

### Key Principles
3-5 fundamental concepts that govern success in this position:
- Constant sleeve tension creates control and prevents opponent's advance
- Foot placement on biceps provides leverage for sweeps and balance breaking
- Dynamic movement between attacks maintains offensive initiative
- Distance management through leg extension controls opponent's pressure
- Grip fighting determines position retention and attack opportunities

### Prerequisites
Skills/positions that should be mastered before attempting this position:
- Basic open guard concepts and hip mobility
- Sleeve grip fighting and grip retention skills
- Understanding of basic sweep mechanics and timing

## State Machine Integration Elements

### State Invariants
Conditions that must remain true for this position to be maintained:
- Both sleeve grips must be secured with deep, strong connections
- At least one foot must be in contact with opponent's bicep or arm
- Opponent must be in kneeling or standing posture within guard
- Tension must be maintained through extended arms and leg pressure

### Timing Considerations
When this position is most/least effective:
- Most effective when opponent is attempting to establish grips or pressure
- Less effective against opponents with superior grip fighting skills
