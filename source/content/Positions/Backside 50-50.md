## State Description
The Backside 50/50 (often called "B50/50" or "Reverse 50/50") is an advanced leg entanglement position that represents a significant positional improvement over the standard 50/50 configuration. Unlike the traditional 50/50 where both practitioners have equal access to each other's legs, the Backside 50/50 creates an asymmetrical advantage by positioning the practitioner behind the opponent's leg with enhanced heel hook exposure. This position is characterized by the practitioner controlling the opponent's leg in a modified 50/50 configuration while establishing a back-side angle that dramatically increases submission potential while simultaneously reducing the opponent's counter-attacking options. The position has become increasingly prominent in modern no-gi competition as part of the evolution of sophisticated leg lock systems, particularly through the influence of competitors like Gordon Ryan and Craig Jones.

## Key Principles
- Establish control of opponent's leg in modified 50/50 configuration
- Create and maintain backside angle for enhanced heel exposure
- Control opponent's knee line to prevent defensive rotation
- Apply strategic hip pressure to maximize breaking mechanics
- Prevent opponent from establishing defensive frames or grips
- Limit opponent's mobility through proper weight distribution
- Control upper body positioning to enhance leg control
- Create dilemmas between submission defense and positional escape

## Prerequisites
- Strong understanding of standard 50/50 mechanics
- Recognition of transitional opportunities
- Knowledge of rotational leg control principles
- Defensive awareness against counter-attacks
- Understanding of heel hook breaking mechanics

## State Invariants
- Asymmetrical leg entanglement favoring practitioner
- Practitioner positioned at backside angle relative to opponent's leg
- Enhanced heel exposure for inside heel hook
- Opponent's counter-attacking options significantly reduced
- Clear pathway to submission completion
- Practitioner's legs securely controlling opponent's entangled leg

## Defensive Responses (When Opponent Has This State)
- [[Emergency Heel Protection]] → [[Submission Defense]]
- [[Hip Elevation]] → [[Pressure Reduction]]
- [[Knee Line Recovery]] → [[Defensive Positioning]]
- [[Leg Retraction Attempt]] → [[Space Creation]]
- [[Upper Body Movement]] → [[Frame Creation]]

## Offensive Transitions (Available From This State)
- [[Backside 50/50 Heel Hook]] → [[Inside Heel Hook]]
- [[Cross Ashi Transition]] → [[Cross Ashi Garami]]
- [[Transition to Top Position]] → [[Top Position]]
- [[Backside 50/50 Ankle Lock]] → [[Straight Ankle Lock]]
- [[Leg Reap Variation]] → [[Inside Sankaku]]
- [[Back Step to Mount]] → [[Mount]]
- [[Full Leg Control]] → [[Leg Control Position]]
- [[Return to 50/50]] → [[50/50 Guard]]

## Counter Transitions
- [[Re-establish Backside 50/50]] → [[Backside 50/50]] (against defensive movements)
- [[Switch to Inside Sankaku]] → [[Inside Sankaku]] (if position is compromised)
- [[Transition to Cross Ashi]] → [[Cross Ashi Garami]] (under pressure)

## Expert Insights
- **Danaher System**: Views the Backside 50/50 as one of the premier control positions within the leg entanglement hierarchy, emphasizing its role as an improved variation of the standard 50/50. Focuses on precise mechanical details for controlling the opponent's knee line and preventing defensive rotations while maximizing heel exposure. Particularly emphasizes methodical progression from control to breaking mechanics when applying the heel hook.
- **Gordon Ryan**: Has made the Backside 50/50 a cornerstone of his leg lock system, demonstrating its effectiveness at the highest levels of competition. Emphasizes the importance of establishing complete control before initiating breaking mechanics, with particular focus on trapping the opponent's defensive options before committing to the submission. Views the position as offering one of the highest percentage finishing opportunities in the leg lock hierarchy.
- **Eddie Bravo**: While not traditionally as focused on this specific position, acknowledges its effectiveness within modern leg lock systems. When addressing the position, emphasizes creative transitions to and from the position rather than extended control within it, consistent with the 10th Planet philosophy of continuous movement between positions.

## Common Errors
- Insufficient backside angle → Reduced heel exposure
- Poor knee line control → Defensive rotation opportunity
- Premature breaking attempt → Position compromise
- Neglecting upper body positioning → Reduced overall control
- Insufficient hip pressure → Suboptimal breaking mechanics
- Focusing solely on submission → Missing positional advantages

## Training Drills
- Backside 50/50 entry and control maintenance against progressive resistance
- Transition flows between standard 50/50 and Backside 50/50
- Breaking mechanics practice with controlled pressure application
- Defensive recognition and counter drills
- Position maintenance against active defensive movement

## Related States
- [[50/50 Guard]] - Related but less advantageous position
- [[Inside Sankaku]] - Connected leg entanglement
- [[Cross Ashi Garami]] - Related leg control position
- [[Inside Heel Hook]] - Primary submission threat
- [[Straight Ankle Lock]] - Secondary submission option

## Decision Tree
If opponent attempts to hide heel:
- Execute [[Backside 50/50 Heel Hook]] or [[Cross Ashi Transition]]

Else if opponent elevates hips defensively:
- Execute [[Leg Reap Variation]] or [[Back Step to Mount]]

Else if opponent tries to create frames:
- Execute [[Full Leg Control]] or [[Backside 50/50 Ankle Lock]]

Else if position becomes compromised:
- Execute [[Return to 50/50]] or [[Transition to Top Position]]

## Position Metrics
- Success Rate: 80% submission probability when fully established
- Average Time in Position: 10-30 seconds
- Submission Probability: 75%
- Positional Advancement Probability: 85%
- Position Loss Probability: 15%

## Optimal Paths
Standard heel hook path:
[[Backside 50/50]] → [[Backside 50/50 Heel Hook]] → [[Inside Heel Hook]] → [[Won by Submission]]

Positional advancement path:
[[Backside 50/50]] → [[Transition to Top Position]] → [[Top Position]] → positional progression sequence

Alternative submission path:
[[Backside 50/50]] → [[Cross Ashi Transition]] → [[Cross Ashi Garami]] → [[Inside Heel Hook]] → [[Won by Submission]]

## Historical Context
The Backside 50/50 gained prominence in the mid-2010s as part of the broader evolution of the modern leg lock game. While the standard 50/50 had been established earlier, the backside variation represented a significant refinement that addressed many of the criticisms of the traditional position (such as its symmetrical nature and defensive stalemates). The position was popularized by practitioners from the Danaher Death Squad, particularly Gordon Ryan and Craig Jones, who demonstrated its effectiveness in high-level competition. The position exemplifies the ongoing technical evolution in BJJ, where established positions are continually refined and improved upon as the meta-game develops.

## Ruleset Considerations
The Backside 50/50's utility varies across competition rulesets:
- IBJJF: Limited application in the gi with inside heel hooks prohibited
- ADCC: Fully legal and highly effective, particularly in the advanced divisions
- Submission-only formats: Represents one of the highest percentage finishing positions
- MMA: Less common due to striking vulnerability but still applicable in ground exchanges

## Computer Science Analogy
The Backside 50/50 functions as an "asymmetric state transformation" in the BJJ state machine, where a potentially neutral position (standard 50/50) is converted into a highly advantageous one through a specific geometric reconfiguration. This creates a form of "state space advantage" where the controlling player's action space remains fully accessible while the opponent's viable actions are severely constrained. The position exemplifies the concept of "asymmetric information" in game theory, where one player (the controlling practitioner) has complete information about submission threats while the defending player must operate with partial information due to the compromised visual and proprioceptive feedback created by the position.
