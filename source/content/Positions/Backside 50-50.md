# Backside 50/50
#bjj #state #leglock #entanglement #modern

## State Properties
- **State ID**: S056
- **Point Value**: 2 (Advantageous control position)
- **Position Type**: Dominant leg entanglement
- **Risk Level**: Low
- **Energy Cost**: Low to Medium
- **Time Sustainability**: Medium

## State Description
The Backside 50/50 (often called "B50/50" or "Reverse 50/50") is an advanced leg entanglement position that represents a significant positional improvement over the standard 50/50 configuration. Unlike the traditional 50/50 where both practitioners have equal access to each other's legs, the Backside 50/50 creates an asymmetrical advantage by positioning the practitioner behind the opponent's leg with enhanced heel hook exposure. This position is characterized by the practitioner controlling the opponent's leg in a modified 50/50 configuration while establishing a back-side angle that dramatically increases submission potential while simultaneously reducing the opponent's counter-attacking options. The position has become increasingly prominent in modern no-gi competition as part of the evolution of sophisticated leg lock systems, particularly through the influence of competitors like Gordon Ryan and Craig Jones.

### Visual Description
You are positioned behind your opponent's leg, seated or on your side, with their leg trapped between yours in a modified 50/50 entanglement, creating a significant asymmetrical advantage. Your inside leg typically hooks over their thigh or knee, while your outside leg controls their ankle or foot, maintaining a tight connection through your hips to expose their heel for potential submissions. Your body is angled to the backside of their leg, allowing you to apply strategic hip pressure and control their knee line, severely limiting their ability to rotate or counter-attack. Your upper body may be engaged in controlling their posture or hands to prevent defensive frames, ensuring that their counter-options are minimized while you set up high-percentage leg locks like the inside heel hook.

## Key Principles
- Establish control of opponent's leg in modified 50/50 configuration
- Create and maintain backside angle for enhanced heel exposure
- Control opponent's knee line to prevent defensive rotation
- Apply strategic hip pressure to maximize breaking mechanics
- Prevent opponent from establishing defensive frames or grips
- Limit opponent's mobility through proper weight distribution
- Control upper body positioning to enhance leg control
- Create dilemmas between submission defense and positional escape

## Prerequisites
- Strong understanding of standard 50/50 mechanics
- Recognition of transitional opportunities
- Knowledge of rotational leg control principles
- Defensive awareness against counter-attacks
- Understanding of heel hook breaking mechanics

## State Invariants

## Expert Insights
- **Danaher System**: Views the Backside 50/50 as one of the premier control positions within the leg entanglement hierarchy, emphasizing its role as an improved variation of the standard 50/50. Focuses on precise mechanical details for controlling the opponent's knee line and preventing defensive rotations while maximizing heel exposure. Particularly emphasizes methodical progression from control to breaking mechanics when applying the heel hook.
- **Gordon Ryan**: Has made the Backside 50/50 a cornerstone of his leg lock system, demonstrating its effectiveness at the highest levels of competition. Emphasizes the importance of establishing complete control before initiating breaking mechanics, with particular focus on trapping the opponent's defensive options before committing to the submission. Views the position as offering one of the highest percentage finishing opportunities in the leg lock hierarchy.
- **Eddie Bravo**: While not traditionally as focused on this specific position, acknowledges its effectiveness within modern leg lock systems. When addressing the position, emphasizes creative transitions to and from the position rather than extended control within it, consistent with the 10th Planet philosophy of continuous movement between positions.

## Historical Context
The Backside 50/50 gained prominence in the mid-2010s as part of the broader evolution of the modern leg lock game. While the standard 50/50 had been established earlier, the backside variation represented a significant refinement that addressed many of the criticisms of the traditional position (such as its symmetrical nature and defensive stalemates). The position was popularized by practitioners from the Danaher Death Squad, particularly Gordon Ryan and Craig Jones, who demonstrated its effectiveness in high-level competition. The position exemplifies the ongoing technical evolution in BJJ, where established positions are continually refined and improved upon as the meta-game develops.

## Timing Considerations
- **Optimal Conditions**: Most effective when opponent's leg is isolated and their posture is compromised, allowing for quick setup of the backside angle before they can defend.
- **Avoid When**: Less effective if opponent maintains strong posture or controls your legs, reducing the likelihood of securing the advantageous angle.
- **Energy/Fatigue Factors**: Low to medium energy cost means it can be maintained for a reasonable duration, but prolonged engagement can lead to fatigue in the legs and hips.

## Ruleset Considerations
The Backside 50/50's utility varies across competition rulesets:
- **IBJJF**: Limited application in the gi with inside heel hooks prohibited, often requiring alternative submissions or transitions.
- **ADCC**: Fully legal and highly effective, particularly in the advanced divisions where heel hooks are a primary threat.
- **Professional Submission-Only Formats**: Represents one of the highest percentage finishing positions, frequently used in leg lock systems.
- **MMA**: Less common due to striking vulnerability but still applicable in ground exchanges where control can be maintained.

## Computer Science Analogy
The Backside 50/50 functions as an "asymmetric state transformation" in the BJJ state machine, where a potentially neutral position (standard 50/50) is converted into a highly advantageous one through a specific geometric reconfiguration. This creates a form of "state space advantage" where the controlling player's action space remains fully accessible while the opponent's viable actions are severely constrained. The position exemplifies the concept of "asymmetric information" in game theory, where one player (the controlling practitioner) has complete information about submission threats while the defending player must operate with partial information due to the compromised visual and proprioceptive feedback created by the position.
