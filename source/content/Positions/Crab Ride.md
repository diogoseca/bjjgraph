## State Properties
- **State ID**: S038
- **Point Value**: 2 (Advantageous control position)
- **Position Type**: Back attack/control position
- **Risk Level**: Medium
- **Energy Cost**: Medium to High
- **Time Sustainability**: Short to Medium

## State Description
Crab Ride is a modern control position where the practitioner maintains control of the opponent's back while positioned to the side rather than directly behind them. The controlling practitioner typically has one leg hooked around the opponent's waist while the other leg is positioned over or near the opponent's far shoulder, creating a powerful diagonal control configuration. This position offers a unique blend of back control mechanics with greater mobility, making it particularly effective for dynamic transitions to the back, leg entanglements, and various submission attacks. The Crab Ride has become increasingly prominent in modern competition BJJ as both a transitional position and a control point within advanced guard systems.

## Key Principles
- Establish diagonal body positioning relative to opponent
- Maintain strong upper body connection through effective grips
- Create pressure and control through proper leg positioning
- Utilize weight distribution to limit opponent's mobility
- Maintain positional control while setting up attacks
- Use opponent's defensive reactions to advance position
- Create and exploit transition opportunities to more dominant positions

## Prerequisites
- Understanding of back control mechanics
- Hip mobility and leg dexterity
- Recognition of entry opportunities
- Ability to maintain balance in asymmetrical positions

## State Invariants
- Practitioner positioned diagonally to opponent's back
- One leg hooked around opponent's waist/hip
- One leg positioned toward opponent's far shoulder
- Upper body control through various grip configurations
- Opponent partially turned away from practitioner

## Defensive Responses (When Opponent Has This State)
- [[Turn Into Opponent]] → [[Guard Position]]
- [[Two-on-One Grip Break]] → [[Grip Fighting]]
- [[Hip Escape]] → [[Turtle Position]]
- [[Forward Roll]] → [[Scramble Position]]
- [[Technical Stand-up]] → [[Standing Position]]

## Offensive Transitions (Available From This State)
- [[Crab Ride to Back]] → [[Back Control]]
- [[Berimbolo Completion]] → [[Back Control]]
- [[Leg Drag from Crab]] → [[Leg Drag Position]]
- [[Crucifix Entry]] → [[Crucifix Position]]
- [[Crab to Armbar]] → [[Armbar Control]]
- [[Leg Entanglement Entry]] → [[Single Leg X Guard]]
- [[Rolling Back Attack]] → [[Back Control]]
- [[Truck Entry]] → [[Truck Position]]

## Counter Transitions
- [[Re-establish Crab Ride]] → [[Crab Ride]] (against escape attempts)
- [[Switch to Seated Guard]] → [[Butterfly Guard]] (if position is compromised)
- [[Retreat to Leg Entanglement]] → [[Single Leg X Guard]] (under pressure)

## Expert Insights
- **Danaher System**: Views the Crab Ride as a powerful transitional position within the back attack system, focusing on the precise mechanical connections that make the position difficult to escape while offering multiple attack pathways. Emphasizes the relationship between the Crab Ride, traditional back control, and various submission entries.
- **Gordon Ryan**: Utilizes the Crab Ride extensively as part of his back attack system, particularly as a position to maintain control during transitions when the opponent defends traditional back control. Emphasizes maintaining constant pressure and connection points throughout dynamic movement sequences.
- **Eddie Bravo**: Has developed specialized variations of the Crab Ride within his 10th Planet system, often connecting it to the Truck position and his leg lock system. Emphasizes unorthodox entries and transitions from positions not commonly associated with traditional back attacks.

## Common Errors
- Insufficient hip connection → Loss of control
- Poor upper body control → Defensive mobility
- Overcommitment to single attack → Predictability
- Crossing feet → Vulnerability to leg locks
- Neglecting grip control → Escape opportunities

## Training Drills
- Crab Ride maintenance against progressive resistance
- Transition flows between Crab Ride and related positions
- Entry practice from various positions
- Attack sequencing with progressive resistance
- Defensive recovery when position is compromised

## Related States

- [[Berimbolo]] - Dynamic back-taking technique
- [[Inverted Guard]] - Related modern position
- [[Leg Drag Position]] - Connected passing position
- [[Truck Position]] - Eddie Bravo's specialized control position

## Decision Tree
If opponent turns away defensively:
- Execute [[Crab Ride to Back]] or [[Rolling Back Attack]]

Else if opponent turns in aggressively:
- Execute [[Leg Drag from Crab]] or [[Leg Entanglement Entry]]

Else if opponent reaches across body:
- Execute [[Crucifix Entry]] or [[Crab to Armbar]]

Else if opponent attempts to stand:
- Execute [[Berimbolo Completion]] or [[Truck Entry]]

## Position Metrics
- Success Rate: 70% positional advancement (competition data)
- Average Time in Position: 10-30 seconds
- Back Take Probability: 65%
- Submission Probability: 40%
- Position Loss Probability: 20%

## Optimal Paths
Standard back-taking path:
[[Crab Ride]] → [[Crab Ride to Back]] → [[Back Control]] → [[Rear Naked Choke]] → [[Won by Submission]]

Submission path:
[[Crab Ride]] → [[Crab to Armbar]] → [[Armbar Control]] → [[Armbar Finish]] → [[Won by Submission]]

Specialized path:
[[Crab Ride]] → [[Truck Entry]] → [[Truck Position]] → [[Twister]] → [[Won by Submission]]

## Historical Context
The Crab Ride gained prominence in BJJ in the early 2010s, particularly through the innovation of competitors like Rafa Mendes, Gui Mendes, and the Miyao brothers. While the position shares some mechanical similarities with traditional back control, its unique configuration and dynamic offensive capabilities represented a significant evolution in BJJ's positional hierarchy. The position has become increasingly systematized and integrated into modern competition approaches, particularly in conjunction with berimbolo techniques and leg entanglement entries.

## Computer Science Analogy
The Crab Ride represents a "multi-threaded control algorithm" in the BJJ state graph, where several control mechanisms operate in parallel to create a robust and adaptable position. This implements a form of "redundant control system" where multiple connection points (legs, grips, weight distribution) all contribute to maintaining the position, creating fault tolerance against defensive measures. The position's high connectivity to other advantageous states gives it exceptional "edge weight" in the BJJ state graph, making it a highly valuable node in transitional sequences.
