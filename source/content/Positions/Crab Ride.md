## State Description
Crab Ride is a modern control position where the practitioner maintains control of the opponent's back while positioned to the side rather than directly behind them. The controlling practitioner typically has one leg hooked around the opponent's waist while the other leg is positioned over or near the opponent's far shoulder, creating a powerful diagonal control configuration. This position offers a unique blend of back control mechanics with greater mobility, making it particularly effective for dynamic transitions to the back, leg entanglements, and various submission attacks. The Crab Ride has become increasingly prominent in modern competition BJJ as both a transitional position and a control point within advanced guard systems.

### Visual Description
You are positioned to the side of your opponent, not directly behind, maintaining a diagonal control over their back with a unique leg configuration—one leg hooks tightly around their waist or hip, securing a deep connection, while the other leg extends over or near their far shoulder, often with the knee bent to apply pressure or control their upper body. Your upper body is engaged, using grips like a seatbelt (one arm over their shoulder, one under their armpit) or other controls on their torso or arms to keep their posture compromised and prevent escapes. Your weight is distributed dynamically, often leaning slightly into their back to maintain pressure, while your hips remain mobile, ready to pivot or transition as they react. This setup creates a challenging angle for the opponent, who is typically on their knees or in a turtle position, struggling to turn into you or escape, as your diagonal positioning and leg control make it difficult for them to regain guard or stand, offering you multiple pathways to advance to full back control or attack submissions.

## Key Principles

## Expert Insights
- **Danaher System**: Views the Crab Ride as a powerful transitional position within the back attack system, focusing on the precise mechanical connections that make the position difficult to escape while offering multiple attack pathways. Emphasizes the relationship between the Crab Ride, traditional back control, and various submission entries.
- **Gordon Ryan**: Utilizes the Crab Ride extensively as part of his back attack system, particularly as a position to maintain control during transitions when the opponent defends traditional back control. Emphasizes maintaining constant pressure and connection points throughout dynamic movement sequences.
- **Eddie Bravo**: Has developed specialized variations of the Crab Ride within his 10th Planet system, often connecting it to the Truck position and his leg lock system. Emphasizes unorthodox entries and transitions from positions not commonly associated with traditional back attacks.

## Common Errors
- **Error**: Insufficient hip connection
  - **Consequence**: Leads to loss of control, as weak hip engagement allows the opponent to turn or escape more easily.
  - **Correction**: Ensure your hooking leg is deeply connected around their waist or hip, maintaining constant pressure to limit their mobility.
- **Error**: Poor upper body control
  - **Consequence**: Results in increased defensive mobility for the opponent, enabling them to posture up or initiate escapes.
  - **Correction**: Secure strong grips, such as a seatbelt or harness, to keep their upper body compromised and prevent turning motions.
- **Error**: Overcommitment to single attack
  - **Consequence**: Creates predictability, allowing the opponent to anticipate and counter your intended submission or transition.
  - **Correction**: Vary your attacks and transitions, using feints or multiple threats to keep the opponent guessing.
- **Error**: Crossing feet
  - **Consequence**: Increases vulnerability to leg locks, as crossed feet provide an easy target for the opponent to attack.
  - **Correction**: Keep your legs positioned asymmetrically, avoiding crossing them, and be mindful of leg lock threats during transitions.
- **Error**: Neglecting grip control
  - **Consequence**: Offers escape opportunities, as without strong grips, the opponent can break connections and regain position.
  - **Correction**: Actively fight for and maintain grip control, prioritizing upper body connections to limit their defensive options.

## Training Drills
- **Crab Ride Maintenance**: Practice maintaining Crab Ride against progressive resistance, focusing on hip connection and grip strength.
- **Transition Flows**: Drill transition flows between Crab Ride and related positions like Back Control or Truck, ensuring smooth movement.
- **Entry Practice**: Work on entry practice from various positions, learning to establish Crab Ride dynamically during scrambles or guard passes.
- **Attack Sequencing**: Engage in attack sequencing with progressive resistance, chaining submissions and transitions from Crab Ride.
- **Defensive Recovery**: Practice defensive recovery when the position is compromised, learning to re-establish control or transition to safer positions.

## Historical Context
The Crab Ride gained prominence in BJJ in the early 2010s, particularly through the innovation of competitors like Rafa Mendes, Gui Mendes, and the Miyao brothers. While the position shares some mechanical similarities with traditional back control, its unique configuration and dynamic offensive capabilities represented a significant evolution in BJJ's positional hierarchy. The position has become increasingly systematized and integrated into modern competition approaches, particularly in conjunction with berimbolo techniques and leg entanglement entries.

## Computer Science Analogy
The Crab Ride represents a "multi-threaded control algorithm" in the BJJ state graph, where several control mechanisms operate in parallel to create a robust and adaptable position. This implements a form of "redundant control system" where multiple connection points (legs, grips, weight distribution) all contribute to maintaining the position, creating fault tolerance against defensive measures. The position's high connectivity to other advantageous states gives it exceptional "edge weight" in the BJJ state graph, making it a highly valuable node in transitional sequences.
