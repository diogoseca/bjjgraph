# Ashi Garami
#bjj #state #leg_entanglement #submission_position #leglock

## State Properties
- **State ID**: S009
- **Point Value**: 1 (Slight advantage)
- **Position Type**: Offensive control position
- **Risk Level**: Medium to High
- **Energy Cost**: Low to Medium
- **Time Sustainability**: Medium

## State Description
Ashi Garami (leg entanglement) is a fundamental leg lock position where one of the opponent's legs is controlled between your legs. This position is the foundation of the modern leg lock game and comes in various configurations including Standard Ashi, Inside Sankaku (Honey Hole/411), Outside Sankaku (50/50), and Cross Ashi. Ashi Garami provides control over the opponent's mobility while creating submission opportunities targeting the ankle, knee, and hip joints.

### Visual Description
You are typically seated or on your side, facing your opponent, with one of their legs trapped between yours, creating a tight entanglement that isolates their limb from defensive resources. Your inside leg is often hooked over their thigh or knee, while your outside leg controls their ankle or foot, maintaining a strong connection through your hips to prevent escape. Your upper body may be engaged in controlling their posture or hands to limit their ability to counter or stand, often leaning slightly back or to the side to create optimal angles for submissions. This setup restricts the opponent's movement significantly, allowing you to attack their leg with submissions like ankle locks or to transition to more dominant leg entanglement positions.

## Key Principles
- Control the opponent's leg through proper entanglement
- Isolate the targeted limb from opponent's defensive resources
- Establish strong hip connection to prevent escapes
- Create and maintain proper angles for submissions
- Control opponent's upper body positioning when possible
- Anticipate and counter escape attempts

## Prerequisites
- Understanding of leg lock mechanics and safety
- Knowledge of proper hip positioning
- Familiarity with rotational control concepts
- Awareness of competition rule restrictions

## State Invariants
- Opponent's leg trapped between your legs
- Hip connection maintained
- Control of opponent's entangled leg
- Angle established for potential submission

## Defensive Responses (When Opponent Has This State)
- [[Leg Slip and Hip Escape]] → [[Leg Entanglement]] (Success Rate: 40%)
- [[Rotational Defense]] → [[Neutral Position]] (Success Rate: 35%)
- [[leg entanglement]] → [[50-50 Guard]] (Success Rate: 30%)
- [[Turn to Knees]] → [[Turtle Position]] (Success Rate: 25%)
- [[Boot Escape]] → [[Standing Escape]] (Success Rate: 20%)

## Offensive Transitions (Available From This State)

- [[Crab Ride Transition]] → [[Crab Ride]] (Success Rate: Beginner 20%, Intermediate 30%, Advanced 40%)
- [[Technical Stand-up]] → [[Top Position]] (Success Rate: Beginner 30%, Intermediate 40%, Advanced 50%)

## Counter Transitions
- [[Re-establish Ashi Garami]] → [[Ashi Garami]] (against escape attempts)
- [[Switch to SLX]] → [[Single Leg X Guard]] (if control is compromised)
- [[Elevate to X-Guard]] → [[X-Guard]] (against pressure)

## Expert Insights
- **Danaher System**: Views Ashi Garami as the foundation of the "Lower Body Dilemma" system, but considers standard Ashi as primarily a control position rather than a submission position. Emphasizes methodical positional advancement to more dominant forms of leg entanglement before attempting submissions.
- **Gordon Ryan**: Uses Ashi Garami as a transitional position, often quickly advancing to inside Sankaku or other more dominant leg entanglements. Emphasizes upper body control alongside the leg entanglement to neutralize defensive hand fighting.
- **Eddie Bravo**: Incorporated leg entanglements into his 10th Planet system as the "Lockdown" evolved into more offensive configurations. Focuses on unique transitions between traditional 10th Planet positions and leg entanglements, particularly the "Honey Hole" (Inside Sankaku).

## Common Errors
- **Error**: Poor hip connection
  - **Consequence**: Creates escape opportunities as the opponent can pull their leg free or rotate out of the entanglement.
  - **Correction**: Maintain a strong hip connection by keeping your legs tight around the opponent's leg and your hips aligned to control their movement.
- **Error**: Focusing solely on submission
  - **Consequence**: Leads to control compromise, allowing the opponent to counter or escape due to lack of positional dominance.
  - **Correction**: Prioritize control over the opponent's leg and upper body before attempting submissions to ensure a stable position.
- **Error**: Improper angle for submissions
  - **Consequence**: Results in ineffective control, making submissions harder to apply and increasing the chance of escape.
  - **Correction**: Adjust your body angle to create optimal leverage for submissions, often by leaning back or to the side to expose the targeted joint.
- **Error**: Failing to control upper body
  - **Consequence**: Increases vulnerability to counter attacks as the opponent can use their hands or posture to disrupt your control.
  - **Correction**: Use your arms or upper body to control the opponent's posture or hands, preventing them from initiating counters.
- **Error**: Neglecting defensive awareness
  - **Consequence**: Leads to exposure to counter leg attacks, as the opponent may attempt to entangle your legs in response.
  - **Correction**: Maintain awareness of your own leg positioning and be ready to counter or disengage if the opponent targets your legs.

## Training Drills
- **Entry from Various Positions**: Practice Ashi Garami entry from different positions like guard, standing, or after a sweep to build versatility.
- **Transition Cycles**: Drill transition cycles between different leg entanglements such as Inside Sankaku, Outside Sankaku, and Cross Ashi to improve fluidity.
- **Hip Connection Maintenance**: Work on hip connection maintenance with progressive resistance, focusing on keeping a tight entanglement to prevent escapes.
- **Submission Setup and Control Sequences**: Focus on submission setup and control sequences, ensuring proper angles and control before attempting finishes.
- **Defensive Reaction and Recovery Drills**: Practice defensive reaction and recovery drills to counter opponent's escape attempts and maintain or regain control.

## Computer Science Analogy
Ashi Garami represents a branch point in the BJJ state graph with high strategic optionality. It creates a decision problem for the opponent where each defensive action opens pathways to different attacking sequences. The position can be modeled as having multiple weighted edges leading to terminal nodes (submissions) with varying probabilities based on the defender's responses.

## Timing Considerations
- **Optimal Conditions**: Most effective when opponent's leg is isolated and their posture is compromised, allowing for quick setup and control before they can defend.
- **Avoid When**: Less effective if opponent maintains strong posture or controls your legs, reducing the likelihood of securing the entanglement.
- **Energy/Fatigue Factors**: Low to medium energy cost means it can be maintained for a reasonable duration, but prolonged engagement can lead to fatigue in the legs and hips.

## Historical Context
Ashi Garami has roots in traditional Japanese Jiu-Jitsu and Judo, where it was used as a control position and for joint locks. It gained prominence in modern BJJ through the influence of practitioners like John Danaher and the Danaher Death Squad, who systematized leg lock attacks, making Ashi Garami a cornerstone of the contemporary leg lock game. Its evolution reflects the growing emphasis on lower body attacks in competitive grappling.

## Ruleset Considerations
The Ashi Garami's application varies across competition rulesets:
- **IBJJF**: Legal at all belt levels for control, but certain submissions from this position (like heel hooks) are restricted until higher belts.
- **ADCC**: Highly effective due to the focus on submission finishes, with various leg lock variations being common and encouraged.
- **Professional Submission-Only Formats**: Frequently seen as part of complex leg lock systems with transitions to advanced entanglements and submissions.
- **MMA**: Effective for control and submissions, though the risk of strikes during setup or transition must be considered.

## Safety Considerations
Leg entanglements require careful training and application due to potential injury risks. Practitioners should understand proper mechanics and respect submission signals promptly. Some competition rulesets restrict certain leg lock variations, requiring position-specific rule knowledge.
