## State Properties
- **State ID**: S009
- **Point Value**: 1 (Slight advantage)
- **Position Type**: Offensive control position
- **Risk Level**: Medium to High
- **Energy Cost**: Low to Medium
- **Time Sustainability**: Medium

## State Description
Ashi Garami (leg entanglement) is a fundamental leg lock position where one of the opponent's legs is controlled between your legs. This position is the foundation of the modern leg lock game and comes in various configurations including Standard Ashi, Inside Sankaku (Honey Hole/411), Outside Sankaku (50/50), and Cross Ashi. Ashi Garami provides control over the opponent's mobility while creating submission opportunities targeting the ankle, knee, and hip joints.

## Key Principles
- Control the opponent's leg through proper entanglement
- Isolate the targeted limb from opponent's defensive resources
- Establish strong hip connection to prevent escapes
- Create and maintain proper angles for submissions
- Control opponent's upper body positioning when possible
- Anticipate and counter escape attempts

## Prerequisites
- Understanding of leg lock mechanics and safety
- Knowledge of proper hip positioning
- Familiarity with rotational control concepts
- Awareness of competition rule restrictions

## State Invariants
- Opponent's leg trapped between your legs
- Hip connection maintained
- Control of opponent's entangled leg
- Angle established for potential submission

## Defensive Responses (When Opponent Has This State)
- [[Leg Slip and Hip Escape]] → [[Leg Entanglement Escape]]
- [[Rotational Defense]] → [[Neutral Position]]
- [[Counter Leg Entanglement]] → [[50/50 Guard]]
- [[Turn to Knees]] → [[Turtle Position]]
- [[Boot Escape]] → [[Standing Escape]]

## Offensive Transitions (Available From This State)
- [[Straight Ankle Lock]] → [[Won by Submission]]
- [[Transition to Inside Sankaku]] → [[Inside Sankaku]]
- [[Transition to Outside Sankaku]] → [[50/50 Guard]]
- [[Transition to Cross Ashi]] → [[Cross Ashi]]
- [[Back Step to Backside 50/50]] → [[Backside 50/50]]
- [[Crab Ride Transition]] → [[Crab Ride]]
- [[Technical Stand-up]] → [[Top Position]]

## Counter Transitions
- [[Re-establish Ashi Garami]] → [[Ashi Garami]] (against escape attempts)
- [[Switch to SLX]] → [[Single Leg X Guard]] (if control is compromised)
- [[Elevate to X-Guard]] → [[X-Guard]] (against pressure)

## Expert Insights
- **Danaher System**: Views Ashi Garami as the foundation of the "Lower Body Dilemma" system, but considers standard Ashi as primarily a control position rather than a submission position. Emphasizes methodical positional advancement to more dominant forms of leg entanglement before attempting submissions.
- **Gordon Ryan**: Uses Ashi Garami as a transitional position, often quickly advancing to inside Sankaku or other more dominant leg entanglements. Emphasizes upper body control alongside the leg entanglement to neutralize defensive hand fighting.
- **Eddie Bravo**: Incorporated leg entanglements into his 10th Planet system as the "Lockdown" evolved into more offensive configurations. Focuses on unique transitions between traditional 10th Planet positions and leg entanglements, particularly the "Honey Hole" (Inside Sankaku).

## Common Errors
- Poor hip connection → Escape opportunities
- Focusing solely on submission → Control compromise
- Improper angle for submissions → Ineffective control
- Failing to control upper body → Vulnerability to counter attacks
- Neglecting defensive awareness → Exposure to counter leg attacks

## Training Drills
- Ashi Garami entry from various positions
- Transition cycles between different leg entanglements
- Hip connection maintenance with resistance
- Submission setup and control sequences
- Defensive reaction and recovery drills

## Related States
- [[Inside Sankaku]] - Advanced leg entanglement targeting inside heel hook
- [[50/50 Guard]] - Mutual leg entanglement position
- [[Single Leg X Guard]] - Precursor leg entanglement position
- [[Cross Ashi]] - Modified leg entanglement with cross-body control
- [[Backside 50/50]] - Attacking from behind the leg entanglement

## Decision Tree
If opponent turns away (exposing heel):
- Execute [[Transition to Inside Sankaku]]

Else if opponent turns in defensively:
- Execute [[Transition to Outside Sankaku]]

Else if opponent stands up:
- Execute [[Elevate to X-Guard]] or maintain [[Ankle Lock Control]]

Else if opponent is flat and controlled:
- Execute [[Straight Ankle Lock]]

## Position Metrics
- Success Rate: 65% control retention (competition data)
- Average Time in Position: 30-60 seconds
- Submission Probability: 35%
- Advanced Position Probability: 50%
- Position Loss Probability: 15%

## Optimal Paths
IBJJF legal competition path:
[[Ashi Garami]] → [[Straight Ankle Lock]] → [[Won by Submission]]

Advanced competition path:
[[Ashi Garami]] → [[Transition to Inside Sankaku]] → [[Inside Heel Hook]] → [[Won by Submission]]

Positional advancement path:
[[Ashi Garami]] → [[Technical Stand-up]] → [[Top Position]] → conventional submission sequence

## Computer Science Analogy
Ashi Garami represents a branch point in the BJJ state graph with high strategic optionality. It creates a decision problem for the opponent where each defensive action opens pathways to different attacking sequences. The position can be modeled as having multiple weighted edges leading to terminal nodes (submissions) with varying probabilities based on the defender's responses.

## Safety Considerations
Leg entanglements require careful training and application due to potential injury risks. Practitioners should understand proper mechanics and respect submission signals promptly. Some competition rulesets restrict certain leg lock variations, requiring position-specific rule knowledge.
