## State Properties
- **State ID**: S034
- **Point Value**: 1 (Slight advantage)
- **Position Type**: Transitional passing position
- **Risk Level**: Low to Medium
- **Energy Cost**: Low
- **Time Sustainability**: Medium to Long

## State Description
Combat Base is a fundamental posture in BJJ where the top player has one knee up and one knee down, creating a stable tripod-like base that offers both defensive stability and offensive options. Typically, the front foot is positioned up with the knee pointing outward while the back knee is on the mat. This asymmetrical stance provides exceptional balance against sweeps while enabling dynamic movement for guard passing. Combat Base serves as both a transitional position and a strategic reset point during guard passing exchanges, making it one of the most important technical postures in the BJJ positional hierarchy.

## Key Principles
- Establish wide base with proper weight distribution
- Keep front foot positioned at proper angle to prevent sweeps
- Maintain active posture with upright spine
- Control opponent's legs or hips with effective gripping
- Create and exploit angles for passing opportunities
- Maintain proper distance to avoid submission attempts
- Prepare for dynamic transitions to passing sequences

## Prerequisites
- Understanding of base and balance mechanics
- Grip fighting fundamentals
- Recognition of passing opportunities
- Defensive awareness against sweeps and submissions

## State Invariants
- One knee up (typically front leg)
- One knee down (typically back leg)
- Upright torso with good posture
- Wide base with proper weight distribution
- Dynamic engagement with opponent's guard

## Defensive Responses (When Opponent Has This State)
- [[Butterfly Hook]] → [[Butterfly Sweep]]
- [[Collar Drag]] → [[Sweep to Mount]]
- [[Single Leg Attempt]] → [[Sweep to Top]]
- [[Shin-to-Shin Entry]] → [[Shin-to-Shin Guard]]
- [[Submission Entry]] → [[Submission Control]]

## Offensive Transitions (Available From This State)
- [[Knee Cut Pass]] → [[Side Control]]
- [[Headquarters Transition]] → [[Headquarters Position]]
- [[Leg Drag Setup]] → [[Leg Drag Pass]]
- [[Smash Pass]] → [[Side Control]]
- [[Toreando Setup]] → [[Toreando Pass]]
- [[Combat Base to Back Take]] → [[Back Control]]
- [[Over Under Entry]] → [[Over Under Pass]]
- [[Standing Transition]] → [[Open Guard Top]]

## Counter Transitions
- [[Re-establish Combat Base]] → [[Combat Base]] (against sweep attempts)
- [[Sprawl Response]] → [[Front Headlock]] (against shots)
- [[Post and Base]] → [[Defensive Base]] (against submissions)

## Expert Insights
- **Danaher System**: Emphasizes Combat Base as a fundamental "home base" position for guard passing, viewing it as a stable starting point from which multiple passing sequences can be initiated. Focuses on precise weight distribution and posture details that maximize stability while maintaining offensive options. Creates systematic connections between Combat Base and specific passing sequences based on the opponent's guard configuration.
- **Gordon Ryan**: Utilizes Combat Base as a transitional position within his pressure-based passing system, often using it as a reset point between passing attempts or as a defensive posture when faced with strong guard retention. Emphasizes the connection between Combat Base and the headquarters position as complementary control positions.
- **Eddie Bravo**: Has incorporated Combat Base principles into his 10th Planet system while adapting certain details for no-gi specific scenarios. Focuses on using Combat Base as a launching point for specialized passing sequences that connect to 10th Planet-specific control positions.

## Common Errors
- Narrow base → Vulnerability to sweeps
- Forward leaning posture → Susceptibility to collar drags
- Poor knee positioning → Reduced stability
- Passive positioning → Missing offensive opportunities
- Telegraphing passing direction → Predictable patterns

## Training Drills
- Combat Base maintenance against progressive sweep attempts
- Transition flows between Combat Base and passing sequences
- Recovery to Combat Base when balance is compromised
- Grip fighting sequences from Combat Base
- Passing initiation drills from stable Combat Base

- [[Open Guard Top]] - General guard passing position
- [[Top Position]] - Generic dominant position
- [[Knee Cut Position]] - Dynamic passing position
- [[Defensive Base]] - Emergency defensive posture

## Decision Tree
If opponent establishes butterfly hooks:
- Execute [[Headquarters Transition]] or [[Knee Cut Pass]]

Else if opponent attempts to control your posting leg:
- Execute [[Leg Drag Setup]] or [[Toreando Setup]]

Else if opponent plays supine open guard:
- Execute [[Over Under Entry]] or [[Smash Pass]]

Else if opponent sits up aggressively:
- Execute [[Combat Base to Back Take]] or [[Sprawl Response]]

## Position Metrics
- Success Rate: 70% stability (against sweep attempts)
- Average Time in Position: 10-30 seconds
- Pass Initiation Probability: 75%
- Sweep Vulnerability: 25%
- Submission Vulnerability: 10%

## Optimal Paths
Standard passing path:
[[Combat Base]] → [[Knee Cut Pass]] → [[Side Control]] → [[Mount]] → submission options

Dynamic passing path:
[[Combat Base]] → [[Leg Drag Setup]] → [[Leg Drag Pass]] → [[Back Control]] → [[Rear Naked Choke]] → [[Won by Submission]]

Pressure passing path:
[[Combat Base]] → [[Over Under Entry]] → [[Over Under Pass]] → [[Side Control]] → pressure submissions

## Computer Science Analogy
Combat Base functions as a "stable state" in the BJJ state machine with high resistance to destabilizing inputs (sweep attempts). It implements a "fault-tolerant architecture" through its tripod structure that provides redundant support against balance disruption. The position serves as an efficient "hub node" in the BJJ state graph, offering multiple outbound edges with favorable transition probabilities to advantageous states, while minimizing the probability of transitioning to disadvantageous states.
