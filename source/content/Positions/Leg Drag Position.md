## State Properties
- **State ID**: S062
- **Point Value**: 3 (Dominant passing position)
- **Position Type**: Passing/Control
- **Risk Level**: Low
- **Energy Cost**: Medium
- **Time Sustainability**: Medium

## State Description
The Leg Drag Position is a dominant control position where the top practitioner has dragged one of the opponent's legs across their body, effectively turning the opponent's hips away and compromising their guard structure. This creates a powerful pins the opponent's leg against their opposite leg while providing the top player with upper body control and multiple pathways to advance position. A hallmark of modern BJJ, the Leg Drag Position offers exceptional control with minimal defensive risks and serves as a gateway to both side control and back control. Unlike a completed guard pass, the Leg Drag Position represents a control state that immobilizes the opponent while creating optimal passing angles.

## Key Principles
- Keep opponent's dragged leg pinned against their opposite leg
- Control opponent's upper body to prevent defensive frames
- Maintain chest-to-chest connection when possible
- Apply downward pressure to keep opponent flat
- Position hips to block opponent's hip mobility
- Create passing angles through upper and lower body control
- Prevent opponent from turning back to face you
- Generate forward pressure toward the pinned leg

## Prerequisites
- Successful execution of [[Leg Drag Pass]]
- Control of opponent's leg and upper body
- Proper weight distribution and base
- Neutralization of opponent's defensive frames
- Effective grip configuration

## State Invariants
- Opponent's leg dragged across your body
- Hip control established
- Opponent's guard structure compromised
- Upper body control to limit defensive options
- Base established with strong posture

## Defensive Responses (When Opponent Has This State)
- [[Inversion Defense]] → [[Inverted Guard]]
- [[Frame and Reguard]] → [[Guard Recovery]]
- [[Underhook Counter]] → [[Half Guard Recovery]]
- [[Emergency Turtle]] → [[Turtle Position]]
- [[Technical Stand-up]] → [[Standing Position]]

## Offensive Transitions (Available From This State)
- [[Complete Leg Drag]] → [[Side Control]]
- [[Back Step]] → [[Back Control]]
- [[Knee Cut Follow-up]] → [[Knee on Belly]]
- [[Mount Transition]] → [[Mount]]
- [[Far Side Armbar]] → [[Armbar Control]]
- [[Kimura Trap]] → [[Kimura Control]]
- [[North-South Transition]] → [[North-South]]
- [[Folding Pass Completion]] → [[Side Control]]

## Counter Transitions
- [[Re-drag Sequence]] → [[Leg Drag Position]] (against escape attempts)
- [[Switch to Knee Cut]] → [[Knee Cut Pass]] (if leg drag control compromised)
- [[Backstep]] → [[Back Control]] (if opponent turns away)

## Expert Insights
- **Danaher System**: Emphasizes the leg drag as a control position rather than merely a passing technique, focusing on precise pressure distribution that creates a series of "cascading dominoes" where each defensive option the opponent selects leads to an even more dominant position. Particularly focuses on controlling the opponent's head position to prevent defensive movement.
- **Gordon Ryan**: Utilizes the leg drag as a primary control position in his passing system, often holding the position to force defensive reactions before proceeding to more dominant positions. Places significant emphasis on upper body control through underhooks or collar ties while maintaining the leg drag control.
- **Eddie Bravo**: Has adapted the leg drag concept to his no-gi system with modified control points focusing more on head control and shoulder pressure. Often uses the leg drag as a pathway to his specialized "Truck" position rather than conventional passing outcomes.

## Common Errors
- Insufficient upper body control → Opponent creates defensive frames
- Allowing space between bodies → Recovery opportunities
- Poor pressure distribution → Decreased control effectiveness
- Failing to pin leg completely → Guard recovery pathways
- Rushing to complete the pass → Loss of control and position
- Improper base → Vulnerability to sweeps or inversions
- Neglecting head control → Opponent can create frames

## Training Drills
- Leg drag maintenance against increasing resistance
- Transition cycles between leg drag and related positions
- Upper body control sequences from leg drag
- Counter-inversion responses
- Passing completion progressions
- Leg drag to back take flow drills

## Related States
- [[Side Control]] - Common destination after leg drag completion
- [[Back Control]] - Frequent transition from leg drag when opponent turns away
- [[Headquarters Position]] - Common setup position before leg drag
- [[Knee Cut Pass]] - Related passing system with similar mechanics
- [[Folding Pass Position]] - Complementary pressure passing position

## Decision Tree
If opponent attempts to turn in toward you:
- Execute [[Underhook Control]] → [[Side Control]]

Else if opponent attempts to turn away from you:
- Execute [[Back Step]] → [[Back Control]]

Else if opponent creates strong defensive frames:
- Execute [[Switch to Knee Cut]] → [[Knee on Belly]]

Else (stable control established):
- Execute [[Complete Leg Drag]] → [[Side Control]]

## Position Metrics
- Success Rate: 85% pass completion (competition data)
- Average Time in Position: 15-40 seconds
- Side Control Transition Probability: 60%
- Back Control Transition Probability: 30%
- Position Loss Probability: 10%

## Optimal Paths
Primary control path:
[[Leg Drag Position]] → [[Complete Leg Drag]] → [[Side Control]] → [[Mount]] → submission chain

Back-taking path:
[[Leg Drag Position]] → [[Back Step]] → [[Back Control]] → [[Rear Naked Choke]] → [[Won by Submission]]

Advanced competition path:
[[Headquarters Position]] → [[Leg Drag Pass]] → [[Leg Drag Position]] → [[Side Control]] → [[Mount]] → [[High Mount]] → [[S-Mount]] → [[Armbar from Mount]] → [[Won by Submission]]

## Computer Science Analogy
The Leg Drag Position functions as a highly efficient "state constriction" node in the BJJ state machine. It dramatically reduces the opponent's available state transitions (defensive options) while simultaneously expanding the controlling player's possible transitions to advantageous states. This creates an asymmetric decision graph where the controlling player enjoys a branching factor advantage - they have numerous high-value paths forward while the controlled player has few viable options, most of which lead to even worse states. This position exemplifies the concept of "asymmetric computational complexity" in adversarial systems, where one agent faces significantly more complex problems than the other.
