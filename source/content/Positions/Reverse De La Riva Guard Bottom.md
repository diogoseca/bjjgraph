# Reverse De La Riva Guard Bottom
#bjj #state #guard #bottom #advanced

## State Properties
- **State ID**: S085
- **Point Value**: 0 (Neutral position)
- **Position Type**: Offensive guard with back-taking opportunities
- **Risk Level**: Medium
- **Energy Cost**: Medium
- **Time Sustainability**: Medium

## State Description
Reverse De La Riva Guard Bottom is an advanced open guard position where the bottom player inverts their De La Riva hook, threading their near leg through the opponent's far leg from behind while maintaining control of the opponent's opposite leg. This creates a powerful off-balancing system that specializes in back takes, waiter sweeps, and kiss of the dragon entries. Unlike traditional De La Riva, which focuses on leg entanglements and direct sweeps, Reverse De La Riva excels at creating angles that expose the opponent's back.

The position requires strong hip mobility and core strength to maintain the inverted hook structure. It's particularly effective against standing opponents or those attempting to pass around the hooking side. The guard has become increasingly popular in modern competition due to its effectiveness at creating immediate back-taking opportunities, which are highly valued in both gi and no-gi grappling.

### Visual Description
You are on your back with your hips elevated off the mat, with your near leg threaded through your opponent's far leg from behind, hooking around their thigh or calf to create the inverted De La Riva configuration. Your far leg controls their opposite leg, typically hooking behind their far knee or securing an ankle grip to prevent them from stepping away. Your near-side hand often grips their far ankle or pant leg, while your far-side hand controls their near leg or hip to maintain the frame. Your hips are actively elevated and mobile, not flat on the mat, allowing you to generate off-balancing pressure by pushing and pulling with your hooks. Your shoulders are turned toward the opponent to prevent them from passing to your back, and you maintain constant tension in your hook system to control their base. This creates a dynamic position where you can quickly transition to sweeps, back takes, or single leg X variations based on their defensive reactions.

## Key Principles
- **Hip Elevation**: Keep hips off the mat to maintain mobility and pressure
- **Inverted Hook Control**: The reversed De La Riva hook creates unique off-balancing angles
- **Far Leg Management**: Controlling opponent's far leg prevents escape and creates sweep opportunities
- **Shoulder Positioning**: Keep shoulders turned toward opponent to prevent back exposure
- **Dynamic Tension**: Maintain active push-pull pressure with both legs
- **Angle Creation**: Use hip movement to create angles for back attacks
- **Grip Fighting**: Strategic grips on ankles and pants enhance control

## Prerequisites
- Strong hip mobility for maintaining inverted hook position
- Understanding of basic De La Riva guard mechanics
- Core strength for sustained hip elevation
- Familiarity with back-taking sequences

## Expert Insights
- **John Danaher**: "The Reverse De La Riva represents an inversion of the traditional De La Riva mechanics, creating a specialized lever system for back exposure. The key insight is understanding that this guard doesn't seek to sweep directly forward like conventional guards, but rather to rotate the opponent's body to expose their back. The inverted hook creates a unique fulcrum point that allows even smaller practitioners to generate significant off-balancing force against larger opponents. The position requires accepting a moment of vulnerability during the inversion, but this is compensated by the immediate access to high-value back-taking positions."

- **Gordon Ryan**: "I use Reverse De La Riva as a primary back-taking entry in competition, particularly against opponents who are proficient at defending traditional De La Riva. The waiter sweep is my highest percentage technique from here, as it forces the opponent into a compromised position whether they defend by staying heavy or by trying to backstep. The key is maintaining constant tension in the hook system and never allowing your hips to flatten out. In no-gi, the position works even better because opponents can't use pants grips to stabilize, making the off-balancing extremely effective."

- **Eddie Bravo**: "Reverse De La Riva fits perfectly into the 10th Planet system's emphasis on back attacks and unconventional entries. We connect it directly to the crab ride and truck positions, creating a seamless chain from guard to back control. The inverted hook creates confusion for opponents who are drilling traditional passing sequences, and the hip mobility required develops naturally when you're also training rubber guard and lockdown variations. I teach students to view this as a transitional position rather than a static guard, always looking to roll under for the back or sweep to top position within a few seconds of establishing the hook."

## Common Errors
- **Error**: Keeping hips flat on the mat
  - **Consequence**: Reduces mobility and eliminates the off-balancing pressure that makes the position effective, allowing opponent to easily control distance and initiate passes.
  - **Correction**: Actively elevate your hips off the mat by engaging your core and maintaining tension in your hook structure, creating dynamic pressure that keeps opponent off-balance.
  - **Recognition**: If you feel static or unable to generate movement, your hips are likely too flat.

- **Error**: Losing far leg control
  - **Consequence**: Opponent can step away with their far leg, eliminating the hook's effectiveness and allowing them to escape the guard system entirely.
  - **Correction**: Maintain strong hook control behind opponent's far knee or secure ankle grip with your hand, never allowing them freedom of movement with that leg.
  - **Recognition**: If opponent easily steps back or changes stance, you've lost far leg control.

- **Error**: Allowing shoulders to flatten toward the mat
  - **Consequence**: Exposes your back to the opponent, creating immediate passing opportunities and potentially giving up points or back control.
  - **Correction**: Keep shoulders turned toward the opponent at all times, maintaining a side-facing orientation that protects your back while allowing offensive movement.
  - **Recognition**: If you feel opponent's weight on your back or hear your coach yelling to turn in, your shoulders are too flat.

- **Error**: Static hook position without active pressure
  - **Consequence**: Transforms an offensive guard into a passive holding position, giving opponent time to establish grips and initiate their passing strategy.
  - **Correction**: Constantly push and pull with your hooks, creating dynamic tension that forces opponent to react and defend rather than attack.
  - **Recognition**: If opponent seems comfortable and unhurried in your guard, you're not generating enough active pressure.

- **Error**: Attempting techniques without proper setup
  - **Consequence**: Telegraphs your intentions and allows opponent to counter before you can complete the technique, wasting energy and potentially losing position.
  - **Correction**: Use off-balancing movements and grip fighting to create reactions, then capitalize on opponent's defensive adjustments with your actual attack.
  - **Recognition**: If your attacks are consistently defended early in their execution, you're not setting them up properly.

## Training Drills
- **Hook Maintenance Drill**: Partner attempts to extract their leg while you maintain the inverted hook structure with progressive resistance (25%, 50%, 75%), focusing on hip mobility and hook pressure.

- **Sweep Chain Drilling**: Flow between waiter sweep, kiss of the dragon, and crab ride entries based on partner's weight distribution, developing recognition of which technique to apply in each situation.

- **Far Leg Control Practice**: Partner attempts to step away with their far leg while you maintain control using hooks and grips, alternating between ankle control and knee control to understand both options.

- **Hip Elevation Endurance**: Hold the hip-elevated position for 30-60 second intervals while partner applies light pressure, building the core strength necessary for sustained position maintenance.

- **Back Take Sequences**: From established Reverse De La Riva, drill complete sequences to back control through various entries (kiss of the dragon, crab ride, direct back take), emphasizing smooth transitions.
