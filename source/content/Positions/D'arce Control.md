# D'arce Control
#bjj #state #submission #choke #darce

## State Properties
- **State ID**: S029
- **Point Value**: 2 (Advantageous submission control)
- **Position Type**: Submission control position
- **Risk Level**: Medium
- **Energy Cost**: Medium
- **Time Sustainability**: Short to Medium

## State Description
The D'arce Control (also known as Brabo Choke in some circles) is a powerful submission position where the practitioner encircles the opponent's head and one arm in a modified arm-triangle configuration. The choking arm threads under the opponent's armpit and around their neck, while the other arm locks the position by grasping the choking arm's bicep. This creates a vice-like compression of the opponent's neck and carotid arteries. The D'arce is particularly effective against opponents who turn to their side or turtle, making it an excellent counter to common defensive postures in BJJ.

### Visual Description
You are positioned facing your opponent, often from a top position like side control or front headlock, with your choking arm threaded deeply under their armpit and around their neck, the hand ideally reaching towards their far shoulder or back to maximize control. Your other arm locks the position by grasping the bicep of your choking arm, forming a tight loop that encircles their head and trapped arm, applying pressure to their neck. Your body is aligned to maintain leverage, often with your chest or shoulder pressing against their head or upper back, and your hips positioned to control their lower body, preventing them from creating space or turning away. This setup creates a constricting hold on the opponent, who is typically on their side or in a turtle position on the mat, with one arm and their head trapped, struggling to alleviate the pressure on their neck as you prepare to finish the choke or transition to another dominant position.

## Key Principles
- Thread choking arm deep around opponent's neck and shoulder
- Lock the position by grabbing own bicep or shoulder
- Control opponent's body alignment through hip positioning
- Create and maintain proper shoulder pressure against carotid arteries
- Apply strategic pressure through mechanical alignment rather than strength
- Prevent opponent from creating space or alleviating pressure
- Manage transitions to secure optimal finishing position

## Prerequisites
- Understanding of arm triangle mechanics
- Shoulder mobility and forearm control
- Recognition of entry opportunities
- Ability to maintain body connection during transitions

## State Invariants
- One arm threaded under opponent's armpit and around neck
- Locked grip configuration (typically grabbing own bicep)
- Opponent's one arm trapped inside the choke
- Head positioning against opponent's shoulder/neck
- Body alignment that facilitates compression

## Expert Insights
- **Danaher System**: Emphasizes the D'arce as part of the "Front Headlock System," focusing on the precise mechanical details of arm positioning and compression angles. Creates systematic approach to using initial control to guide the opponent into the optimal finishing configuration. Focuses particularly on the proper depth of the choking arm and precise body alignment to maximize efficacy.
- **Gordon Ryan**: Utilizes the D'arce extensively in competition, often setting it up from front headlock and side control positions. Emphasizes creating and maintaining connection points that prevent defensive movement while transitioning to the optimal finishing position. Particularly emphasizes cutting angles that maximize compression.
- **Eddie Bravo**: Has adapted the D'arce to his 10th Planet system with unique entries and specialized variants like the "Zombie" and "Marce." Focuses on setups from half guard and turtle positions, often connecting the technique to his specialized control positions like the Truck.

## Common Errors
- **Error**: Insufficient arm depth
  - **Consequence**: Leads to ineffective compression, as the choking arm isn't positioned deeply enough to apply pressure on the neck.
  - **Correction**: Ensure your choking arm threads deeply under their armpit and around their neck, reaching towards their far shoulder or back.
- **Error**: Poor body alignment
  - **Consequence**: Results in reduced choking pressure, as improper alignment diminishes leverage and control over the opponent.
  - **Correction**: Align your body to maintain leverage, with your chest or shoulder pressing against their head or upper back, and hips controlling their lower body.
- **Error**: Overreliance on arm strength
  - **Consequence**: Causes energy inefficiency, tiring you out quickly and reducing the effectiveness of the choke over time.
  - **Correction**: Focus on mechanical alignment and shoulder pressure rather than brute strength to compress their neck and carotid arteries.
- **Error**: Losing body connection
  - **Consequence**: Offers space creation opportunities, allowing the opponent to alleviate pressure or initiate escapes.
  - **Correction**: Maintain tight body connection, keeping your hips and chest positioned to prevent them from creating space or turning.
- **Error**: Rushing the finish
  - **Consequence**: Leads to position compromise, as hastening the submission can create openings for the opponent to counter or escape.
  - **Correction**: Secure control first, ensuring all connection points are tight before attempting to finish the choke.

## Training Drills
- **D'arce Entry and Control**: Practice D'arce entry and control maintenance with progressive resistance, focusing on arm depth and grip security.
- **Transition Flows**: Drill transition flows between D'arce and related front headlock submissions like Anaconda or Guillotine, ensuring smooth movement.
- **Body Positioning and Alignment**: Work on body positioning and alignment exercises, learning to maximize leverage and pressure through proper angles.
- **Defensive Recognition and Counters**: Engage in defensive recognition and counter drills, identifying opponent escape attempts and adjusting control accordingly.
- **Finishing Mechanics**: Practice finishing mechanics with minimal strength application, focusing on mechanical compression for energy efficiency.

## Historical Context
The D'arce choke (named after Joe D'arce who popularized it in the US) emerged as a prominent submission in the early 2000s, becoming increasingly prevalent in high-level competition. While the mechanics relate to traditional arm triangles, the specific configuration and versatile application made it a staple technique in modern BJJ. The position's effectiveness against common defensive postures like the turtle and technical stand-up has contributed to its prominence in contemporary competition.

## Computer Science Analogy
The D'arce Control represents a specialized "constraint satisfaction problem" in the BJJ state graph, where multiple variables (arm position, head alignment, body connection, grip configuration) must be optimized simultaneously to create an effective submission state. The position creates a "deadlock" scenario for the opponent where attempting to resolve one constraint often worsens another, leading to a terminal state (submission) if properly maintained. This represents an effective implementation of a "resource contention" algorithm where critical resources (space, defensive frames, posture) are systematically denied.
