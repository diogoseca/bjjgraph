## State Properties
- **State ID**: S029
- **Point Value**: 2 (Advantageous submission control)
- **Position Type**: Submission control position
- **Risk Level**: Medium
- **Energy Cost**: Medium
- **Time Sustainability**: Short to Medium

## State Description
The D'arce Control (also known as Brabo Choke in some circles) is a powerful submission position where the practitioner encircles the opponent's head and one arm in a modified arm-triangle configuration. The choking arm threads under the opponent's armpit and around their neck, while the other arm locks the position by grasping the choking arm's bicep. This creates a vice-like compression of the opponent's neck and carotid arteries. The D'arce is particularly effective against opponents who turn to their side or turtle, making it an excellent counter to common defensive postures in BJJ.

## Key Principles
- Thread choking arm deep around opponent's neck and shoulder
- Lock the position by grabbing own bicep or shoulder
- Control opponent's body alignment through hip positioning
- Create and maintain proper shoulder pressure against carotid arteries
- Apply strategic pressure through mechanical alignment rather than strength
- Prevent opponent from creating space or alleviating pressure
- Manage transitions to secure optimal finishing position

## Prerequisites
- Understanding of arm triangle mechanics
- Shoulder mobility and forearm control
- Recognition of entry opportunities
- Ability to maintain body connection during transitions

## State Invariants
- One arm threaded under opponent's armpit and around neck
- Locked grip configuration (typically grabbing own bicep)
- Opponent's one arm trapped inside the choke
- Head positioning against opponent's shoulder/neck
- Body alignment that facilitates compression

## Defensive Responses (When Opponent Has This State)
- [[Create Space Defense]] → [[Submission Escape]]
- [[Hand Fighting]] → [[Grip Break]]
- [[Hip Escape]] → [[Guard Recovery]]
- [[Forward Roll]] → [[Scramble Position]]
- [[Stack Counter]] → [[Top Position]]

## Offensive Transitions (Available From This State)
- [[D'arce Choke Finish]] → [[Won by Submission]]
- [[D'arce to Mount]] → [[Mounted D'arce]]
- [[Switch to Anaconda]] → [[Anaconda Control]]
- [[D'arce to North-South]] → [[North-South]]
- [[Japanese Necktie Transition]] → [[Japanese Necktie]]
- [[D'arce to Back Control]] → [[Back Control]]
- [[Marce Variation]] → [[Won by Submission]]
- [[Transition to Front Headlock]] → [[Front Headlock]]

## Counter Transitions
- [[Re-establish D'arce]] → [[D'arce Control]] (against escapes)
- [[Switch to Guillotine]] → [[Guillotine Control]] (if position is compromised)
- [[Switch to Front Headlock]] → [[Front Headlock]] (to reset control)

## Expert Insights
- **Danaher System**: Emphasizes the D'arce as part of the "Front Headlock System," focusing on the precise mechanical details of arm positioning and compression angles. Creates systematic approach to using initial control to guide the opponent into the optimal finishing configuration. Focuses particularly on the proper depth of the choking arm and precise body alignment to maximize efficacy.
- **Gordon Ryan**: Utilizes the D'arce extensively in competition, often setting it up from front headlock and side control positions. Emphasizes creating and maintaining connection points that prevent defensive movement while transitioning to the optimal finishing position. Particularly emphasizes cutting angles that maximize compression.
- **Eddie Bravo**: Has adapted the D'arce to his 10th Planet system with unique entries and specialized variants like the "Zombie" and "Marce." Focuses on setups from half guard and turtle positions, often connecting the technique to his specialized control positions like the Truck.

## Common Errors
- Insufficient arm depth → Ineffective compression
- Poor body alignment → Reduced choking pressure
- Overreliance on arm strength → Energy inefficiency
- Losing body connection → Space creation opportunities
- Rushing the finish → Position compromise

## Training Drills
- D'arce entry and control maintenance with progressive resistance
- Transition flows between D'arce and related front headlock submissions
- Body positioning and alignment exercises
- Defensive recognition and counter drills
- Finishing mechanics with minimal strength application

## Related States
- [[Front Headlock]] - Common entry position
- [[Guillotine Control]] - Related front headlock submission
- [[Anaconda Control]] - Complementary front headlock submission
- [[Japanese Necktie]] - Similar mechanics with different configuration
- [[Arm Triangle]] - Related head and arm choke

## Decision Tree
If opponent turns away:
- Execute [[D'arce to Back Control]] or [[Marce Variation]]

Else if opponent drives forward:
- Execute [[D'arce Choke Finish]] or [[D'arce to Mount]]

Else if opponent attempts to create space:
- Execute [[Japanese Necktie Transition]] or [[Switch to Anaconda]]

Else if opponent hand fights effectively:
- Execute [[Transition to Front Headlock]] or [[D'arce to North-South]]

## Position Metrics
- Success Rate: 70% submission or advancement (competition data)
- Average Time in Position: 15-40 seconds
- Submission Probability: 60%
- Counter Vulnerability: 20%
- Position Loss Probability: 15%

## Optimal Paths
Standard finish path:
[[D'arce Control]] → [[D'arce Choke Finish]] → [[Won by Submission]]

Mounted variation path:
[[D'arce Control]] → [[D'arce to Mount]] → [[Mounted D'arce]] → [[Won by Submission]]

Transitional path:
[[D'arce Control]] → [[D'arce to Back Control]] → [[Back Control]] → [[Rear Naked Choke]] → [[Won by Submission]]

## Historical Context
The D'arce choke (named after Joe D'arce who popularized it in the US) emerged as a prominent submission in the early 2000s, becoming increasingly prevalent in high-level competition. While the mechanics relate to traditional arm triangles, the specific configuration and versatile application made it a staple technique in modern BJJ. The position's effectiveness against common defensive postures like the turtle and technical stand-up has contributed to its prominence in contemporary competition.

## Computer Science Analogy
The D'arce Control represents a specialized "constraint satisfaction problem" in the BJJ state graph, where multiple variables (arm position, head alignment, body connection, grip configuration) must be optimized simultaneously to create an effective submission state. The position creates a "deadlock" scenario for the opponent where attempting to resolve one constraint often worsens another, leading to a terminal state (submission) if properly maintained. This represents an effective implementation of a "resource contention" algorithm where critical resources (space, defensive frames, posture) are systematically denied.
