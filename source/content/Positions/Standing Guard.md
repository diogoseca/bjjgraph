# Standing Guard
#bjj #state #guard #standing #defense

## State Properties
- **State ID**: S059
- **Point Value**: 0 (Neutral)
- **Position Type**: Defensive standing position
- **Risk Level**: Medium
- **Energy Cost**: Medium to High
- **Time Sustainability**: Short to Medium

## State Description
Standing Guard represents a specialized defensive position where the practitioner maintains a guard-like defensive structure while standing upright, typically following a technical stand-up from a ground position. Unlike traditional seated or supine guard positions, the Standing Guard creates a defensive framework from an upright posture that prevents the opponent from easily closing distance or securing dominant grips, while simultaneously creating opportunities for the practitioner to disengage, counter-attack, or initiate their own offensive sequences. This position is characterized by the practitioner maintaining proper distance management, strategic grip fighting, and balanced footwork that facilitates defensive maneuverability. Standing Guard serves multiple critical functions including defensive resetting, tactical disengagement, and creating transitional opportunities to more advantageous positions.

## Visual Description

You are standing upright with your feet staggered in a defensive stance, weight balanced and distributed to allow quick movement in any direction, your knees slightly bent and hips mobile. Your hands are extended forward in a defensive posture, palms facing your opponent or gripping their gi to control distance, preventing them from easily establishing dominant grips or closing the distance for takedowns. Your opponent is also standing, attempting to close the gap, establish grips, or set up takedown entries, their body angled toward you seeking control or engagement. Your head and torso maintain an upright athletic posture, not bent forward or backward, with your eyes locked on your opponent's chest and hips to read their movement intentions. Your rear foot typically maintains contact with the mat while your lead foot may be light and mobile, ready to sprawl, step back, or push off for movement. This configuration creates a defensive buffer zone where you maintain the initiative to transition back to ground positions on your terms, disengage from the exchange, or launch counter-attacks when opportunities arise, all while denying your opponent the grips and positioning they need to execute their takedown game.

## Key Principles
- Establish and maintain proper defensive posture
- Create and control distance through effective footwork
- Apply strategic hand positioning to prevent opponent's grips
- Maintain balanced stance for defensive maneuverability
- Control opponent's advance through preventative framing
- Create angles that facilitate defensive effectiveness
- Recognize and capitalize on counter-attacking opportunities
- Execute efficient transitions back to ground positions when advantageous

## Prerequisites
- Understanding of basic standing defense
- Proper technical stand-up mechanics
- Recognition of distance management principles
- Knowledge of grip fighting fundamentals
- Balance and footwork development

## State Invariants
- Practitioner in upright standing posture
- Defensive hand positioning/framing
- Strategic foot positioning and distance
- Balanced weight distribution
- Clear pathways to offensive or defensive transitions
- Disengagement capability maintained

## Defensive Responses (When Opponent Has This State)
- [[Aggressive Pressure]] → [[Close Distance]]
- [[Dominant Grip Establishment]] → [[Grip Advantage]]
- [[Level Change]] → [[Takedown Entry]]
- [[Hook Sweep Attempt]] → [[Distance Collapse]]
- [[Clinch Entry]] → [[Clinch Control]]

## Offensive Transitions (Available From This State)
- [[Technical Stand-up]] → [[Standing Position]]
- [[Defensive Sprawl]] → [[Front Headlock]]
- [[Single Leg Entry]] → [[Single Leg Takedown]]
- [[Pull Guard]] → [[Guard Position]]
- [[Ankle Pick]] → [[Top Position]]
- [[Distance Creation]] → [[Disengagement]]
- [[Sit Back to Guard]] → [[Open Guard Bottom]]
- [[Clinch Engagement]] → [[Clinch Position]]

## Counter Transitions
- [[Re-establish Standing Guard]] → [[Standing Guard]] (against pressure)
- [[Retreat to Seated Guard]] → [[Open Guard Bottom]] (if position is compromised)
- [[Engage Clinch]] → [[Clinch Position]] (under significant pressure)

## Expert Insights
- **Danaher System**: Views the Standing Guard as an important transitional position that facilitates movement between ground-based and standing exchanges. Emphasizes the importance of proper defensive posture and preventative grip fighting that denies the opponent critical control points while maintaining the practitioner's freedom of movement. Particularly focuses on understanding the strategic timing of when to remain in Standing Guard versus transitioning to other positions.
- **Gordon Ryan**: Approaches Standing Guard with a strategic emphasis on creating counter-offensive opportunities rather than purely defensive applications. Emphasizes tactical grip fighting that simultaneously denies the opponent's preferred grips while establishing his own advantageous controls. Views the position as a launching point for either returning to advantageous seated guards or initiating his own offensive sequences.
- **Eddie Bravo**: Has developed specialized approaches to Standing Guard that prioritize creating unique angles and grip configurations that facilitate quick transitions to his preferred ground positions. Emphasizes the importance of deceptive movement and misdirection to create openings for either disengagement or offensive initiation, particularly focusing on seamless transitions back to his 10th Planet guard system.

## Common Errors
- Poor posture maintenance → Vulnerability to takedowns
- Ineffective distance management → Defensive compromise
- Neglecting grip fighting → Opponent control establishment
- Stationary positioning → Limited defensive mobility
- Overcommitment to stand-up → Missing transition opportunities
- Defensive passivity → Initiative surrender

## Training Drills
- Standing Guard maintenance against progressive pressure
- Transition flows between Standing Guard and ground positions
- Grip fighting sequences from standing defensive posture
- Distance management exercises with various stimuli
- Counter-attack recognition and execution drills

## Decision Tree
If opponent changes level for takedown:
- Execute [[Defensive Sprawl]] or [[Pull Guard]]

Else if opponent establishes dominant grips:
- Execute [[Sit Back to Guard]] or [[Clinch Engagement]]

Else if opponent creates distance:
- Execute [[Technical Stand-up]] or [[Distance Creation]]

Else if opponent pressures aggressively:
- Execute [[Single Leg Entry]] or [[Ankle Pick]]

## Position Metrics
- Success Rate: 60% defensive effectiveness
- Average Time in Position: 5-15 seconds
- Transition Probability: 75%
- Counter-Attack Probability: 40%
- Position Loss Probability: 35%

## Optimal Paths
Defensive path:
[[Standing Guard]] → [[Pull Guard]] → [[Guard Position]] → guard retention sequence

Counter-offensive path:
[[Standing Guard]] → [[Defensive Sprawl]] → [[Front Headlock]] → submission sequence

Disengagement path:
[[Standing Guard]] → [[Distance Creation]] → [[Disengagement]] → tactical reset

## Competition Context
Standing Guard applications vary significantly across competition contexts:
- Self-defense: Critical for managing distance and creating disengagement opportunities
- MMA: Essential for safely transitioning between ground and standing phases
- Sport BJJ: Strategically valuable for scoring scenarios and position resets
- No-gi grappling: Particularly valuable for creating leg entanglement entries

## Computer Science Analogy
The Standing Guard functions as a "state transition node" in the BJJ state machine, serving as a critical junction point that connects the ground-based and standing subsystems of the overall grappling network. This creates a form of "interface layer" where practitioners can selectively route execution flow between different position categories based on strategic considerations. The position exemplifies the concept of an "event handler" that can process various opponent inputs (pressure, grips, level changes) and produce appropriate defensive or counter-offensive responses based on pattern recognition and decision rules.
