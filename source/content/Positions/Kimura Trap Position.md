# Kimura Trap Position
#bjj #state #control-position #kimura #intermediate

## State Properties
- **State ID**: S247
- **Point Value**: 0-2 (Depends on starting position)
- **Position Type**: Controlling
- **Risk Level**: Low
- **Energy Cost**: Low
- **Time Sustainability**: Long

## State Description
Kimura Trap Position is a versatile control system characterized by establishing a kimura grip (figure-four grip on opponent's arm) from various positions—most commonly from guard, half guard, or turtle. Rather than immediately pursuing the kimura submission, this position uses the grip as a control mechanism to create sweeps, back takes, and submission opportunities. The kimura trap transforms the kimura from a single submission into a comprehensive positional control system that limits opponent's options while providing multiple offensive pathways.

The position's power lies in the structural control it provides over opponent's upper body. With one arm trapped in the kimura configuration, opponents lose significant defensive and offensive capabilities. This control can be maintained from bottom positions (guard, half guard) or used to dominate scrambles and transitions. The kimura grip itself becomes a steering wheel that allows you to manipulate opponent's posture, balance, and movement.

This position is highly adaptable across different BJJ styles and rule sets. It works effectively in both gi and no-gi, at all belt levels, and against various body types. The kimura trap emphasizes control and patience—maintaining the grip while systematically breaking down opponent's defenses and creating opportunities for advancement or submission.

## Visual Description
You have established a figure-four grip configuration on opponent's arm—your same-side hand grips their wrist while your other hand threads under their armpit (or over their shoulder depending on position) to grip your own wrist, forming a closed loop that traps their arm. Your elbows are pulled tight to your body, creating a strong frame that controls their entire shoulder and arm structure. From guard or half guard, your body is angled with your hips mobile, ready to shift and create angles that amplify the grip's effectiveness. Your legs maintain guard closure or half guard control, working in coordination with upper body control to create full-body dominance. The trapped arm is bent at approximately 90 degrees, with their elbow pointed away from their body—this configuration prevents them from straightening or rotating their arm to escape. Your head positioning varies by context but typically stays close to the trapped arm side to prevent them from rolling toward you. The grip itself feels like a clamp on their shoulder complex, and every micro-adjustment you make with your wrists, elbows, or body angle translates directly into pressure on their trapped shoulder. This creates a dilemma for opponents—defending the grip leaves them vulnerable to sweeps, while defending sweeps exposes them to submission attacks.

## Key Principles
- **Grip Integrity**: Maintain unbreakable kimura grip with wrist-to-wrist connection and tight elbows
- **Dual Threat System**: Constantly threaten both sweeps and submissions to create defensive dilemmas
- **Hip Mobility**: Use active hip movement to create angles and generate sweep momentum
- **Controlled Aggression**: Apply pressure systematically rather than forcing single attacks
- **Arm Isolation**: Keep opponent's trapped arm away from their body to maximize control
- **Transition Readiness**: Maintain grip during positional changes to carry control into new positions

## Prerequisites
- Understanding of kimura grip mechanics
- Grip strength and endurance
- Hip mobility for angle creation
- Sweep timing fundamentals

## State Invariants
- Figure-four kimura grip established on one opponent arm
- Wrist-to-wrist grip maintained with tight elbow connection

## Expert Insights
- **John Danaher**: "The kimura grip is one of the most powerful control mechanisms in grappling because it controls the entire shoulder girdle complex, not just the arm. When you understand the kimura as a control position rather than merely a submission, you unlock its true potential. The grip allows you to control distance, manipulate opponent's base, and create systematic attack sequences. The key is recognizing when to pursue the submission versus when to use the grip to advance position—this decision-making separates effective kimura players from those who simply hunt for the lock. Maintain the grip through transitions and you carry positional dominance with you."

- **Gordon Ryan**: "I use the kimura trap extensively in my guard game, especially from closed guard and half guard. The grip gives me complete control over opponent's posture and movement while threatening multiple attacks. In competition, I've found the kimura sweep to be extremely high percentage because opponents get fixated on defending the submission and forget about their base. The beauty is that whether they defend the sweep or the submission, they're leaving something open. I also use the kimura grip to enter into my back attack system—when someone defends the kimura by rolling, I follow them directly to the back. It's a control position that creates winning positions."

- **Eddie Bravo**: "The kimura trap fits perfectly into the 10th Planet system because it's a control-first approach that sets up multiple attacks. From half guard with the lockdown, establishing the kimura grip creates what I call the 'kimura control system'—you can sweep, submit, or take the back. The grip is especially powerful in no-gi because you don't need fabric to establish control. I teach students to think of the kimura grip as a steering wheel—wherever you turn, opponent has to follow. Combined with our other positions like the truck and back attacks, the kimura trap becomes part of a larger control puzzle that keeps opponents constantly defensive."

## Common Errors
- **Error**: Weak kimura grip
  - **Consequence**: Allows opponent to strip grip or posture up, eliminating control and attack opportunities.
  - **Correction**: Maintain strong wrist-to-wrist grip with elbows tight to body, using your entire frame to control opponent's trapped arm and prevent them from breaking your grip or creating distance.
  - **Recognition**: If opponent easily breaks your grip or maintains good posture, your grip needs strengthening through proper structure and tension.

- **Error**: Focusing only on submission
  - **Consequence**: Misses sweep opportunities and makes offense predictable, allowing opponent to defend submission specifically.
  - **Correction**: Treat kimura trap as control position first—use grip to threaten both sweeps and submissions, forcing opponent to defend multiple attacks and creating openings.
  - **Recognition**: If your kimura attempts consistently fail, you're likely telegraphing the submission and need to incorporate sweeps and transitions.

- **Error**: Poor hip positioning
  - **Consequence**: Reduces sweep effectiveness and limits ability to generate power for kimura finish.
  - **Correction**: Keep hips active and mobile, using hip movement to create angles, generate sweep momentum, and apply pressure to opponent's trapped shoulder during submission attempts.
  - **Recognition**: If your sweeps lack power or your kimura submissions don't create sufficient shoulder pressure, examine your hip positioning and mobility.

- **Error**: Releasing grip prematurely
  - **Consequence**: Loses primary control mechanism before securing position or submission, allowing opponent to escape.
  - **Correction**: Maintain kimura grip throughout transitions—release only when you've achieved dominant position (mount, back control) or secured alternative control mechanism.
  - **Recognition**: If opponent escapes during your transitions, you're likely releasing the grip too early in the sequence.

- **Error**: Neglecting opponent's free arm
  - **Consequence**: Allows opponent to establish frames, grips, or defensive postures that neutralize kimura trap effectiveness.
  - **Correction**: Control or monitor opponent's free arm with your legs, hip positioning, or off-hand to prevent them from creating defensive structures.
  - **Recognition**: If opponent successfully uses their free arm to defend or create space, you need better free arm management.

- **Error**: Static positioning without movement
  - **Consequence**: Allows opponent to settle into defensive posture and eventually escape or counter.
  - **Correction**: Constantly create movement through hip shifts, angle changes, and attack threats to keep opponent reactive and prevent them from establishing stable defense.
  - **Recognition**: If opponent feels comfortable and stable in your kimura trap, you're being too static and need more dynamic movement.

- **Error**: Incorrect elbow positioning
  - **Consequence**: Weakens grip structure and reduces control effectiveness, making it easier for opponent to escape.
  - **Correction**: Keep both elbows pulled tight to your centerline, creating a compact frame that maximizes leverage and control—avoid flaring elbows out which weakens structure.
  - **Recognition**: If grip feels weak or opponent can move their trapped arm significantly, check your elbow positioning and frame structure.

## Training Drills
- **Grip Establishment Drill**: From various positions (closed guard, half guard, side control bottom, turtle), practice quickly establishing kimura grip with proper wrist-to-wrist connection and elbow positioning. Partner provides progressive resistance. 20 repetitions total across different positions, focusing on speed and proper structure. This builds muscle memory for recognizing and securing kimura opportunities.

- **Kimura Control Flow**: With established kimura grip, practice maintaining control while opponent uses 50% effort to escape, posture up, or strip grip. Focus on grip integrity, elbow positioning, and using hip movement to maintain control. 5-minute rounds building endurance and defensive grip maintenance. This develops the ability to hold the position under pressure.

- **Sweep and Submission Combinations**: From kimura trap, flow between kimura sweep, rolling kimura, kimura submission, and back take without releasing grip. Practice recognizing which attack is available based on opponent's reactions. 3-minute rounds focusing on smooth transitions and attack recognition. Partner provides feedback on which defense they're using so you can calibrate your attack selection.

- **Kimura Escape Defense**: Partner establishes kimura grip on you, and you work to defend and escape using proper techniques. This reverse-perspective training helps you understand common escape attempts so you can better anticipate and counter them when attacking. 5-minute rounds switching roles. Track which escapes work best to inform your defensive counters.

- **Live Positional Sparring**: Start in guard or half guard with kimura grip already established. Roll with progressive resistance—first 5 minutes at 50% (focus on technique and control), next 5 minutes at 75% (build timing), final 5 minutes at 100% (test under pressure). Bottom player with grip works for sweeps and submissions, top player works to escape and pass. Reset to kimura trap after each success. Track success rates for different attacks to identify strengths and weaknesses.
