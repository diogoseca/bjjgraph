# Anaconda Control
#bjj #state #submission #choke #anaconda

## State Properties
- **State ID**: S030
- **Point Value**: 2 (Advantageous submission control)
- **Position Type**: Submission control position
- **Risk Level**: Medium
- **Energy Cost**: Medium to High
- **Time Sustainability**: Short to Medium

## State Description
The Anaconda Control is a powerful head and arm choke position where the practitioner encircles the opponent's neck and arm in a modified arm triangle configuration. Unlike the D'arce choke where the arm goes under the opponent's armpit, the Anaconda involves threading the arm under the opponent's neck and linking it with the other arm that goes around the opponent's arm. This creates a vice-like compression of the opponent's neck and carotid arteries. The Anaconda is particularly effective against opponents who expose their neck while in a front headlock or turtle position, making it a valuable component of the front headlock attack system.

### Visual Description
You are positioned in front of or slightly to the side of your opponent, often starting from a front headlock or after a takedown attempt, with one arm threaded deeply under their neck and around their shoulder, while your other arm encircles their near arm, locking your hands together near your bicep or wrist. Your opponent's head is trapped against your chest or shoulder, with their trapped arm bent and pinned inside the choke, limiting their mobility. Your body is typically oriented to create a tight vice around their neck and arm, often with your legs sprawled or positioned to control their lower body, preventing them from posturing up or escaping. This setup allows for a rolling motion to the side or over their back to finalize the choke, maintaining constant pressure on their carotid arteries for a submission.

## Key Principles
- Thread choking arm deep under opponent's neck and around shoulder
- Lock the position by grasping own bicep or wrist
- Roll or step over to create proper finishing angle
- Create and maintain proper shoulder pressure against carotid arteries
- Apply strategic pressure through mechanical alignment rather than strength
- Prevent opponent from creating space or alleviating pressure
- Control opponent's body throughout the rolling transition

## Prerequisites
- Understanding of arm triangle mechanics
- Shoulder mobility and arm flexibility
- Recognition of entry opportunities
- Ability to maintain control during rolling transitions

## State Invariants
- One arm threaded under opponent's neck and around arm
- Locked grip configuration (typically grabbing own bicep)
- Opponent's one arm trapped inside the choke
- Head positioning against opponent's upper arm/shoulder
- Body alignment that facilitates compression

## Expert Insights
- **Danaher System**: Views the Anaconda as an essential component of the "Front Headlock System," focusing on precise entry mechanics and the proper execution of the rolling finish. Emphasizes the importance of maintaining continuous control during the rolling transition, with particular attention to head position and shoulder pressure throughout the movement.
- **Gordon Ryan**: Utilizes the Anaconda primarily as a counter to specific defensive reactions from the front headlock position. Emphasizes properly setting up the position before committing to the roll, ensuring that all escape routes are closed off through strategic limb positioning and pressure application.
- **Eddie Bravo**: Has developed specialized setups to the Anaconda within his 10th Planet system, often connecting it to positions like the Truck and Rubber Guard. Focuses on unique entry methods from unconventional positions and connecting failed Anaconda attempts to other submission options like the D'arce and Guillotine.

## Common Errors
- **Error**: Insufficient arm depth
  - **Consequence**: Results in ineffective compression, allowing opponent to posture up or escape the choke.
  - **Correction**: Ensure your choking arm is threaded deeply under the opponent's neck and around their shoulder before locking the grip.
- **Error**: Poor rolling mechanics
  - **Consequence**: Leads to loss of control during the transition, giving opponent opportunities to counter or escape.
  - **Correction**: Practice the rolling motion to maintain tight control, keeping your body aligned with the opponent's during the movement.
- **Error**: Overreliance on arm strength
  - **Consequence**: Causes energy inefficiency, tiring you out quickly and reducing the effectiveness of the choke.
  - **Correction**: Focus on using shoulder pressure and body alignment to apply the choke rather than raw arm strength.
- **Error**: Improper angle after roll
  - **Consequence**: Results in reduced choking pressure, making it easier for the opponent to defend or escape.
  - **Correction**: Adjust your position post-roll to ensure your shoulder is pressing directly against the opponent's carotid arteries.
- **Error**: Failure to control opponent's body
  - **Consequence**: Creates escape opportunities as the opponent can move their hips or posture up to alleviate pressure.
  - **Correction**: Use your legs and body weight to control the opponent's lower body, preventing them from creating space or escaping.

## Training Drills
- **Entry and Control Maintenance**: Practice Anaconda entry and control maintenance against progressive resistance, focusing on deep arm placement and grip locking.
- **Rolling Transition Practice**: Drill rolling transitions with control maintenance, ensuring tight body alignment during the movement to prevent escapes.
- **Transition Flows**: Work on transition flows between Anaconda and related front headlock submissions like D'arce and Guillotine to build versatility.
- **Grip Fighting and Control Sequences**: Focus on grip fighting and control sequences, emphasizing securing the choke while controlling the opponent's body.
- **Finishing Mechanics**: Practice finishing mechanics from various angles, including side control and after a gator roll, to adapt to different scenarios.

## Optimal Paths
Standard finish path:
[[Anaconda Control]] → [[Anaconda Choke Finish]] → [[Won by Submission]]

Rolling variation path:
[[Anaconda Control]] → [[Gator Roll]] → [[Won by Submission]]

Side control finish path:
[[Anaconda Control]] → [[Roll to Side Control]] → [[Anaconda Side Finish]] → [[Won by Submission]]

## Timing Considerations
- **Optimal Conditions**: Most effective when opponent exposes their neck in a front headlock or turtle position, allowing for quick entry and setup of the choke.
- **Avoid When**: Less effective if opponent maintains strong posture or controls your arms, reducing the likelihood of securing the choke.
- **Energy/Fatigue Factors**: Medium to high energy cost means prolonged engagement can lead to fatigue, reducing effectiveness of the finishing pressure.

## Historical Context
The Anaconda choke gained prominence in BJJ and MMA through the work of competitors like Milton Vieira and Antonio Rodrigo Nogueira in the early 2000s. While sharing mechanical similarities with the arm triangle family of chokes, its unique application and finishing position made it a distinct and valuable addition to the BJJ submission arsenal, particularly for practitioners who specialize in front headlock attacks.

## Ruleset Considerations
The Anaconda Control's application varies across competition rulesets:
- **IBJJF**: Legal at all belt levels, often used as a control position before finishing the choke.
- **ADCC**: Highly effective due to the focus on submission finishes, with rolling techniques like the gator roll being common.
- **Professional Submission-Only Formats**: Frequently seen as part of complex front headlock systems with various transitions.
- **MMA**: Effective in controlling and finishing opponents, though striking can pose risks during setup or transition.

## Computer Science Analogy
The Anaconda Control represents a "state transition function" in the BJJ state graph that includes both a control component and a dynamic movement component (the roll). This creates a complex state space with multiple decision points that must be navigated correctly to reach the terminal state (submission). The position implements a "transactional" approach to submission grappling, where multiple actions must be completed in the correct sequence with proper validation at each step to achieve the desired outcome.
