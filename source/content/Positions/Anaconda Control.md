#bjj #state #submission #choke #anaconda

## State Properties
- **State ID**: S030
- **Point Value**: 2 (Advantageous submission control)
- **Position Type**: Submission control position
- **Risk Level**: Medium
- **Energy Cost**: Medium to High
- **Time Sustainability**: Short to Medium

## State Description
The Anaconda Control is a powerful head and arm choke position where the practitioner encircles the opponent's neck and arm in a modified arm triangle configuration. Unlike the D'arce choke where the arm goes under the opponent's armpit, the Anaconda involves threading the arm under the opponent's neck and linking it with the other arm that goes around the opponent's arm. This creates a vice-like compression of the opponent's neck and carotid arteries. The Anaconda is particularly effective against opponents who expose their neck while in a front headlock or turtle position, making it a valuable component of the front headlock attack system.

## Key Principles
- Thread choking arm deep under opponent's neck and around shoulder
- Lock the position by grasping own bicep or wrist
- Roll or step over to create proper finishing angle
- Create and maintain proper shoulder pressure against carotid arteries
- Apply strategic pressure through mechanical alignment rather than strength
- Prevent opponent from creating space or alleviating pressure
- Control opponent's body throughout the rolling transition

## Prerequisites
- Understanding of arm triangle mechanics
- Shoulder mobility and arm flexibility
- Recognition of entry opportunities
- Ability to maintain control during rolling transitions

## State Invariants
- One arm threaded under opponent's neck and around arm
- Locked grip configuration (typically grabbing own bicep)
- Opponent's one arm trapped inside the choke
- Head positioning against opponent's upper arm/shoulder
- Body alignment that facilitates compression

## Defensive Responses (When Opponent Has This State)
- [[Create Space Defense]] → [[Submission Escape]]
- [[Hand Fighting]] → [[Grip Break]]
- [[Hip Escape]] → [[Guard Recovery]]
- [[Counter Roll]] → [[Scramble Position]]
- [[Shoulder Walk]] → [[Neutral Position]]

## Offensive Transitions (Available From This State)
- [[Anaconda Choke Finish]] → [[Won by Submission]]
- [[Roll to Side Control]] → [[Anaconda Side Finish]]
- [[Gator Roll]] → [[Won by Submission]]
- [[Switch to D'arce]] → [[D'arce Control]]
- [[Transition to Front Headlock]] → [[Front Headlock]]
- [[Anaconda to Back Control]] → [[Back Control]]
- [[Transition to North-South]] → [[North-South]]
- [[Peruvian Necktie Transition]] → [[Peruvian Necktie]]

## Counter Transitions
- [[Re-establish Anaconda]] → [[Anaconda Control]] (against escapes)
- [[Switch to Guillotine]] → [[Guillotine Control]] (if position is compromised)
- [[Switch to Front Headlock]] → [[Front Headlock]] (to reset control)

## Expert Insights
- **Danaher System**: Views the Anaconda as an essential component of the "Front Headlock System," focusing on precise entry mechanics and the proper execution of the rolling finish. Emphasizes the importance of maintaining continuous control during the rolling transition, with particular attention to head position and shoulder pressure throughout the movement.
- **Gordon Ryan**: Utilizes the Anaconda primarily as a counter to specific defensive reactions from the front headlock position. Emphasizes properly setting up the position before committing to the roll, ensuring that all escape routes are closed off through strategic limb positioning and pressure application.
- **Eddie Bravo**: Has developed specialized setups to the Anaconda within his 10th Planet system, often connecting it to positions like the Truck and Rubber Guard. Focuses on unique entry methods from unconventional positions and connecting failed Anaconda attempts to other submission options like the D'arce and Guillotine.

## Common Errors
- Insufficient arm depth → Ineffective compression
- Poor rolling mechanics → Loss of control during transition
- Overreliance on arm strength → Energy inefficiency
- Improper angle after roll → Reduced choking pressure
- Failure to control opponent's body → Escape opportunities

## Training Drills
- Anaconda entry and control maintenance with progressive resistance
- Rolling transition practice with control maintenance
- Transition flows between Anaconda and related front headlock submissions
- Grip fighting and control sequences
- Finishing mechanics from various angles

## Related States
- [[Front Headlock]] - Primary entry position
- [[Guillotine Control]] - Related front headlock submission
- [[D'arce Control]] - Complementary front headlock submission
- [[Peruvian Necktie]] - Related head and arm control
- [[North-South]] - Potential transition position

## Decision Tree
If opponent exposes neck while facing downward:
- Execute [[Anaconda Choke Finish]] or [[Gator Roll]]

Else if opponent turns toward you:
- Execute [[Switch to D'arce]] or [[Roll to Side Control]]

Else if opponent attempts to create space:
- Execute [[Peruvian Necktie Transition]] or [[Anaconda to Back Control]]

Else if opponent effectively defends the choke:
- Execute [[Transition to Front Headlock]] or [[Transition to North-South]]

## Position Metrics
- Success Rate: 65% submission or advancement (competition data)
- Average Time in Position: 10-30 seconds
- Submission Probability: 55%
- Counter Vulnerability: 25%
- Position Loss Probability: 20%

## Optimal Paths
Standard finish path:
[[Anaconda Control]] → [[Anaconda Choke Finish]] → [[Won by Submission]]

Rolling variation path:
[[Anaconda Control]] → [[Gator Roll]] → [[Won by Submission]]

Side control finish path:
[[Anaconda Control]] → [[Roll to Side Control]] → [[Anaconda Side Finish]] → [[Won by Submission]]

## Historical Context
The Anaconda choke gained prominence in BJJ and MMA through the work of competitors like Milton Vieira and Antonio Rodrigo Nogueira in the early 2000s. While sharing mechanical similarities with the arm triangle family of chokes, its unique application and finishing position made it a distinct and valuable addition to the BJJ submission arsenal, particularly for practitioners who specialize in front headlock attacks.

## Computer Science Analogy
The Anaconda Control represents a "state transition function" in the BJJ state graph that includes both a control component and a dynamic movement component (the roll). This creates a complex state space with multiple decision points that must be navigated correctly to reach the terminal state (submission). The position implements a "transactional" approach to submission grappling, where multiple actions must be completed in the correct sequence with proper validation at each step to achieve the desired outcome.
