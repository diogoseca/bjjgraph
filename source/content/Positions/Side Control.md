#bjj #state #dominant #pin #side_control

## State Properties
- **State ID**: S003
- **Point Value**: 3 (Dominant position)
- **Position Type**: Offensive/Controlling
- **Risk Level**: Low
- **Energy Cost**: Medium
- **Time Sustainability**: Long

## State Description
Side Control (also known as side mount or cross-side) is a dominant ground position where the top practitioner lies perpendicularly across the opponent's torso, controlling them without the opponent's legs interfering. This position offers significant control and multiple attacking opportunities while providing a stable base from which to advance to more dominant positions.

## Key Principles
- Distribute weight strategically across opponent's chest and hips
- Eliminate space between bodies
- Control opponent's head and far-side arm
- Maintain low center of gravity
- Use shoulder pressure to restrict breathing and movement
- Create and maintain multiple points of control

## Prerequisites
- Successful guard pass or takedown
- Control of opponent's upper body
- Prevention of guard recovery
- Stability in base and posture

## State Invariants
- Chest-to-chest or chest-to-side connection
- Opponent's guard is fully passed
- Top player is perpendicular or slightly angled to opponent's body
- Head control established (directly or indirectly)

## Defensive Responses (When Opponent Has This State)
- [[Frame and Shrimp]] → [[Guard Recovery]]
- [[Bridge and Roll]] → [[Guard Recovery]] or [[Top Position]]
- [[Elbow-Knee Escape]] → [[Half Guard Bottom]]
- [[Turtle Transition]] → [[Turtle Position]]

## Offensive Transitions (Available From This State)
- [[Transition to Mount]] → [[Mount]]
- [[Transition to North-South]] → [[North-South]]
- [[Knee on Belly]] → [[Knee on Belly]]
- [[Gift Wrap Control]] → [[Back Control]]
- [[Americana Setup]] → [[Americana Control]]
- [[Kimura Setup]] → [[Kimura Control]]
- [[Paper Cutter Choke]] → [[Won by Submission]]
- [[Arm Triangle Setup]] → [[Arm Triangle Control]]

## Counter Transitions
- [[Re-establish Side Control]] → [[Side Control]] (against escape attempts)
- [[Switch Sides]] → [[Side Control]] (when opponent turns away)
- [[Technical Stand-up]] → [[Standing Top Position]] (if control is disrupted)

## Expert Insights
- **Danaher System**: Emphasizes a shoulder of justice (direct shoulder pressure into opponent's jaw/neck) combined with precise weight distribution that makes bridging ineffective. Creates a systematic approach to shutting down each common escape pathway while maintaining constant attack threats.
- **Gordon Ryan**: Utilizes dynamic weight shifting between standard side control and a floating variation to create reaction-based transitions to mount or back control. Focuses on creating "decision dilemmas" where defending one attack opens another.
- **Eddie Bravo**: Often transitions quickly through side control to establish more submission-oriented positions like the truck or twister side control. When maintaining side control, emphasizes the "hundred kilos" position with heavy hip pressure.

## Common Errors
- Posting arms too wide → Vulnerability to sweeps
- Weight too high → Allowing space for escapes
- Hips too high → Opponent can recover guard
- Focusing only on upper body control → Leg entanglement vulnerabilities
- Hunting submissions too early → Losing position

## Training Drills
- Side control maintenance against increasing resistance
- Transitional flows between side control variations
- Submission chain sequences from side control
- Counter-transition drills against escape attempts
- Pressure sensitivity development exercises

## Related States

- [[Reverse Kesa Gatame]] - Reversed scarf hold position
- [[Modified Scarf Hold]] - Variation with near-side underhook
- [[North-South]] - Head-to-head control position
- [[Quarter Mount]] - Transitional position between side control and mount

## Decision Tree
If opponent frames strongly with near arm:
- Execute [[Far Side Armbar]] or [[Kimura Setup]]

Else if opponent turns away:
- Execute [[Transition to Back Control]]

Else if opponent bridges explosively:
- Execute [[Switch to North-South]]

Else (stable control established):
- Progress to [[Transition to Mount]] or [[Arm Triangle Setup]]

## Position Metrics
- Success Rate: 85% retention (competition data)
- Average Time in Position: 1-2 minutes
- Submission Probability: 45%
- Positional Advancement Probability: 60%
- Position Loss Probability: 15%

## Optimal Submission Paths
The shortest path to submission from this position:
[[Side Control]] → [[Paper Cutter Choke]] → [[Won by Submission]]

High-percentage path:
[[Side Control]] → [[Transition to Mount]] → [[Arm Triangle]] → [[Won by Submission]]
