## State Description
The Dead Orchard is an advanced control position within Eddie Bravo's 10th Planet Jiu-Jitsu system, representing a highly specialized variation of the triangle choke position. This position is characterized by the practitioner establishing a triangle position while controlling both of the opponent's arms inside the triangle, effectively creating a double arm triangle configuration. Unlike a standard triangle where only one arm is trapped inside, the Dead Orchard secures both arms, significantly increasing the control and finishing mechanics of the position. The position creates exceptional breaking pressure against both of the opponent's arms while simultaneously applying a powerful compression against the neck, creating a multi-threat submission scenario that is exceptionally difficult to defend once established. The Dead Orchard typically emerges from the Rubber Guard progression but can be accessed from multiple pathways.

## Key Principles
- Trap both of opponent's arms inside triangle configuration
- Create and maintain proper angle for compression
- Apply synchronized pressure against neck and arms
- Maintain proper leg positioning for maximum control
- Establish auxiliary control points to prevent defensive movement
- Prevent opponent from creating defensive frames or posture
- Manage energy through efficient pressure application
- Balance multiple submission threats to create defensive dilemmas

## Prerequisites
- Strong triangle mechanics
- Hip mobility and flexibility
- Understanding of arm control mechanics
- Knowledge of 10th Planet progression system
- Ability to maintain multiple control points

## State Invariants
- Triangle position with legs locked around opponent's neck/shoulder
- Both of opponent's arms trapped inside triangle
- Proper angle established for compression
- Control of opponent's posture and mobility
- Clear pathway to multiple submission finishes
- Opponent's defensive options severely restricted

## Defensive Responses (When Opponent Has This State)
- [[Emergency Bridge]] → [[Pressure Reduction]]
- [[Fight Hands]] → [[Grip Breaking]]
- [[Stack Defense]] → [[Posture Improvement]]
- [[Double Arm Extraction Attempt]] → [[Space Creation]]
- [[Roll to Side]] → [[Positional Escape]]

## Offensive Transitions (Available From This State)
- [[Dead Orchard Armbar]] → [[Armbar Control]]
- [[Dead Orchard Triangle Finish]] → [[Won by Submission]]
- [[Double Arm Crush]] → [[Won by Submission]]
- [[Transition to Mounted Triangle]] → [[Triangle Control]]
- [[Switch to Williams]] → [[Williams Guard]]
- [[Dead Orchard Omoplata]] → [[Omoplata Control]]
- [[Switch to Rubber Guard]] → [[Rubber Guard]]
- [[Rolling Armbar]] → [[Armbar Control]]

## Counter Transitions
- [[Re-establish Dead Orchard]] → [[Dead Orchard Control]] (against defensive movement)
- [[Switch to Standard Triangle]] → [[Triangle Control]] (if one arm escapes)
- [[Transition to Armbar]] → [[Armbar Control]] (under pressure)

## Expert Insights
- **Eddie Bravo**: As the developer of the position, considers the Dead Orchard one of the most powerful control positions in the 10th Planet system. Emphasizes proper mechanics for trapping both arms and maintaining the angle that creates crushing pressure on both the neck and arms. Views the position as an ultimate expression of the principle of creating multiple submission threats that force impossible defensive dilemmas for the opponent.
- **Danaher System**: While not specifically focusing on this position, acknowledges its mechanical efficiency in creating an extremely difficult defensive scenario through the combination of strangle and joint attacks. When analyzing the position, focuses on understanding the force vectors that make the position so controlling and the biomechanical reasons why trapping both arms amplifies the triangle's effectiveness.
- **Gordon Ryan**: Recognizes the position's effectiveness when properly executed but emphasizes preventative measures that stop the progression before both arms become trapped. When addressing defenses, focuses on recognizing the setup patterns that precede the Dead Orchard and interrupting the sequence before full control is established.

## Common Errors
- Insufficient angle creation → Reduced compression pressure
- Poor leg lock maintenance → Control vulnerability
- Inadequate arm control → Defensive escape opportunity
- Improper hip positioning → Suboptimal pressure application
- Overreliance on strength → Energy depletion
- Premature submission attempt → Position compromise

## Training Drills
- Dead Orchard entry and control maintenance against progressive resistance
- Transition flows between Rubber Guard positions and Dead Orchard
- Double arm control practice with various entry methods
- Submission chain drilling from established Dead Orchard
- Defensive recognition and counter-response training

## Decision Tree
If opponent attempts to posture or bridge:
- Execute [[Dead Orchard Triangle Finish]] or [[Double Arm Crush]]

Else if opponent focuses on freeing one arm:
- Execute [[Dead Orchard Armbar]] or [[Transition to Mounted Triangle]]

Else if opponent rolls or attempts to change angle:
- Execute [[Rolling Armbar]] or [[Dead Orchard Omoplata]]

Else if position becomes compromised:
- Execute [[Switch to Williams]] or [[Switch to Rubber Guard]]

## Position Metrics
- Success Rate: 85% submission probability when fully established
- Average Time in Position: 15-30 seconds
- Transition Probability: 70%
- Submission Probability: 80%
- Position Loss Probability: 10%

## Optimal Paths
Standard finish path:
[[Dead Orchard Control]] → [[Dead Orchard Triangle Finish]] → [[Won by Submission]]

Arm attack path:
[[Dead Orchard Control]] → [[Dead Orchard Armbar]] → [[Armbar Control]] → [[Won by Submission]]

Double crush path:
[[Dead Orchard Control]] → [[Double Arm Crush]] → [[Won by Submission]]

## Historical Context
The Dead Orchard was developed by Eddie Bravo as part of his evolving 10th Planet system, representing an innovation that built upon traditional triangle mechanics while incorporating the system's emphasis on creating multiple simultaneous threats. The position gained prominence when Eddie's student, Nathan Orchard (for whom the position is partially named), demonstrated its effectiveness in competition. The "Dead" portion of the name refers to the crushing pressure and the opponent's severely limited defensive options once the position is established. The position exemplifies the 10th Planet approach of developing specialized control configurations that force opponents into defensive dilemmas.

## Computer Science Analogy
The Dead Orchard functions as a "combinatorial constraint system" in the BJJ state machine, where multiple submission threats are simultaneously applied to create an exponentially more complex defensive problem. This implements a form of "AND operation" on submission attacks, where the defender must solve multiple problems simultaneously rather than sequentially. The position exemplifies the concept of a "pruned search tree" where the opponent's action space is so severely constrained that the number of viable defensive pathways approaches zero, creating a nearly deterministic path to submission.
