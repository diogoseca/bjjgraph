# Dead Orchard Control
#bjj #state #guard #10thplanet #submission

## State Properties
- **State ID**: S054
- **Point Value**: 3 (Dominant submission control)
- **Position Type**: Specialized submission control
- **Risk Level**: Low
- **Energy Cost**: Medium
- **Time Sustainability**: Medium

## State Description
The Dead Orchard is an advanced control position within Eddie Bravo's 10th Planet Jiu-Jitsu system, representing a highly specialized variation of the triangle choke position. This position is characterized by the practitioner establishing a triangle position while controlling both of the opponent's arms inside the triangle, effectively creating a double arm triangle configuration. Unlike a standard triangle where only one arm is trapped inside, the Dead Orchard secures both arms, significantly increasing the control and finishing mechanics of the position. The position creates exceptional breaking pressure against both of the opponent's arms while simultaneously applying a powerful compression against the neck, creating a multi-threat submission scenario that is exceptionally difficult to defend once established. The Dead Orchard typically emerges from the Rubber Guard progression but can be accessed from multiple pathways.

### Visual Description
You are positioned on your back or slightly on your side, with your legs locked in a triangle configuration around the opponent's neck and shoulder, one leg over their shoulder and the other under their armpit, tightly securing both of their arms inside this hold. Your hands are often gripping your own shin or ankle to maintain the triangle's tightness, or controlling their far arm to prevent any escape, while your hips are elevated to apply downward pressure on their neck. Your upper body is angled to maximize compression, often pulling their head down with your legs or arms, creating a crushing force on their neck and shoulders as both arms are trapped and hyperextended. This setup severely restricts the opponent, who is typically on their knees or flattened out, with their head and both arms immobilized within your triangle, struggling to breathe or move as you prepare to finish with a choke or arm attack from this dominant control position.

## Key Principles
- Trap both of opponent's arms inside triangle configuration
- Create and maintain proper angle for compression
- Apply synchronized pressure against neck and arms
- Maintain proper leg positioning for maximum control
- Establish auxiliary control points to prevent defensive movement
- Prevent opponent from creating defensive frames or posture
- Manage energy through efficient pressure application
- Balance multiple submission threats to create defensive dilemmas

## Expert Insights
- **Eddie Bravo**: As the developer of the position, considers the Dead Orchard one of the most powerful control positions in the 10th Planet system. Emphasizes proper mechanics for trapping both arms and maintaining the angle that creates crushing pressure on both the neck and arms. Views the position as an ultimate expression of the principle of creating multiple submission threats that force impossible defensive dilemmas for the opponent.
- **Danaher System**: While not specifically focusing on this position, acknowledges its mechanical efficiency in creating an extremely difficult defensive scenario through the combination of strangle and joint attacks. When analyzing the position, focuses on understanding the force vectors that make the position so controlling and the biomechanical reasons why trapping both arms amplifies the triangle's effectiveness.
- **Gordon Ryan**: Recognizes the position's effectiveness when properly executed but emphasizes preventative measures that stop the progression before both arms become trapped. When addressing defenses, focuses on recognizing the setup patterns that precede the Dead Orchard and interrupting the sequence before full control is established.

## Common Errors
- **Error**: Insufficient angle creation
  - **Consequence**: Leads to reduced compression pressure, as improper alignment fails to maximize the choke or arm attacks.
  - **Correction**: Ensure your body is angled to apply downward pressure on their neck, using your hips and legs to create the optimal compression angle.
- **Error**: Poor leg lock maintenance
  - **Consequence**: Results in control vulnerability, as loose legs allow the opponent to posture or extract their head.
  - **Correction**: Maintain a tight triangle by gripping your shin or ankle, keeping constant pressure to secure their neck and arms.
- **Error**: Inadequate arm control
  - **Consequence**: Offers defensive escape opportunities, as uncontrolled arms can be used to frame or push against your hold.
  - **Correction**: Secure both arms tightly within the triangle, using your hands or legs to prevent any movement or extraction.
- **Error**: Improper hip positioning
  - **Consequence**: Leads to suboptimal pressure application, reducing the effectiveness of submissions due to lack of leverage.
  - **Correction**: Elevate and angle your hips to apply downward force on their neck, ensuring maximum compression and control.
- **Error**: Overreliance on strength
  - **Consequence**: Causes energy depletion, tiring you out quickly and diminishing your ability to maintain the position over time.
  - **Correction**: Focus on mechanical pressure and leverage through proper positioning rather than brute strength to apply submissions.
- **Error**: Premature submission attempt
  - **Consequence**: Results in position compromise, as rushing the finish can create openings for the opponent to counter or escape.
  - **Correction**: Secure full control over both arms and neck before attempting submissions, ensuring all connection points are tight.

## Training Drills
- **Dead Orchard Entry and Control**: Practice Dead Orchard entry and control maintenance against progressive resistance, focusing on trapping both arms securely.
- **Transition Flows**: Drill transition flows between Rubber Guard positions and Dead Orchard, ensuring smooth progression to this control.
- **Double Arm Control**: Work on double arm control practice with various entry methods, learning to secure both arms within the triangle.
- **Submission Chain Drilling**: Engage in submission chain drilling from an established Dead Orchard, practicing multiple finishing options.
- **Defensive Recognition and Counters**: Train in defensive recognition and counter-response, identifying opponent escape attempts and adjusting control accordingly.

## Historical Context
The Dead Orchard was developed by Eddie Bravo as part of his evolving 10th Planet system, representing an innovation that built upon traditional triangle mechanics while incorporating the system's emphasis on creating multiple simultaneous threats. The position gained prominence when Eddie's student, Nathan Orchard (for whom the position is partially named), demonstrated its effectiveness in competition. The "Dead" portion of the name refers to the crushing pressure and the opponent's severely limited defensive options once the position is established. The position exemplifies the 10th Planet approach of developing specialized control configurations that force opponents into defensive dilemmas.

## Computer Science Analogy
The Dead Orchard functions as a "combinatorial constraint system" in the BJJ state machine, where multiple submission threats are simultaneously applied to create an exponentially more complex defensive problem. This implements a form of "AND operation" on submission attacks, where the defender must solve multiple problems simultaneously rather than sequentially. The position exemplifies the concept of a "pruned search tree" where the opponent's action space is so severely constrained that the number of viable defensive pathways approaches zero, creating a nearly deterministic path to submission.
