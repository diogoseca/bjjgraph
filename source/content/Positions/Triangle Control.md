# Triangle Control
#bjj #state #submission #control

## State Properties
- **State ID**: S101
- **Point Value**: 3 (Strong dominant position)
- **Position Type**: Offensive
- **Risk Level**: Medium
- **Energy Cost**: High
- **Time Sustainability**: Short to Medium

## State Description
Triangle Control is a dominant submission position where the bottom player traps the opponent's head and one arm between their legs, forming a triangular configuration with their limbs. This position applies pressure to the carotid arteries when properly executed, creating a blood choke that can lead to a submission victory.

## Visual Description

You are on your back with your legs wrapped around your opponent's neck and one of their arms, your calves and shins forming a triangle-shaped lock with one leg positioned across the back of their neck and the other leg's shin secured behind the first leg's knee, creating a figure-four configuration. One of the opponent's arms is trapped inside the triangle alongside their head, while their other arm remains outside, unable to provide effective defense. Your opponent's head is pulled down toward your chest, their face often pressed against your hip or lower torso, with their neck compressed between your thigh and your own shin. Your hips are angled perpendicular to your opponent's torso, not squared to them, maximizing the leverage and pressure on their carotid arteries. Your hands typically control the back of their head or their trapped arm, pulling downward to eliminate space and increase choking pressure, while your shoulder blades and upper back remain on the mat for stability. The opponent is bent forward uncomfortably, their posture completely broken, struggling to create space or posture up against the sustained pressure that restricts blood flow to their brain and threatens to render them unconscious if they don't tap.

## Key Principles
- Create and maintain a perpendicular angle to opponent
- Squeeze with legs, not just ankles
- Pull head down to eliminate space
- Control opponent's trapped arm and posture
- Maintain pressure on opponent's neck, not face
- Adjust leg triangle for maximum pressure on arteries

## Prerequisites
- Hip mobility and flexibility
- Ability to control opponent's posture
- Understanding of precise angle alignment

## State Invariants
- One of opponent's arms is trapped inside the triangle
- One of opponent's arms is outside the triangle
- Your legs form a figure-four around opponent's neck and trapped arm
- Your angle is perpendicular to opponent

## Defensive Responses (When Opponent Has This State)
- [[Posture Up]] → [[Triangle Escape Position]]
- [[Stack Defense]] → [[Triangle Escape Position]]
- [[Von Flue Counter]] → [[Von Flue Position]]
- [[Hand Fight]] → [[Triangle Escape Position]]

## Offensive Transitions (Available From This State)
- [[Triangle Finish]] → [[Won by Submission]]
- [[Transition to Armbar]] → [[Armbar Control]]
- [[Transition to Omoplata]] → [[Omoplata Control]]
- [[Triangle to Mount]] → [[Mount]]
- [[Triangle to Back]] → [[Back Control]]

## Counter Transitions
- [[Readjust Triangle]] → [[Triangle Control]] (against escape attempts)
- [[Switch to Armbar]] → [[Armbar Control]] (if triangle pressure diminishes)
- [[Teepee Adjustment]] → [[Triangle Control]] (against stack defense)

## Expert Insights
- **Danaher System**: Emphasizes exact mechanical alignment to maximize choking pressure. Focuses on controlling defensive structures before applying the choke, ensuring the triangle is a position of control before becoming a submission.
- **Gordon Ryan**: Uses triangles in combination with arm attacks, frequently switching between threats based on opponent reactions. Prefers to create overwhelming problems through attacking multiple targets rather than forcing any single submission.
- **Eddie Bravo**: Incorporates rubber guard principles into triangle setups, using the "Crackhead Control" and "Zombie" systems to establish dominant angles before applying the triangle. Often uses the triangle as a transitional control position rather than just a submission.

## Common Errors
- Poor angle (staying square to opponent) → Reduced choking pressure
- Crossing ankles incorrectly → Ineffective lock
- Focusing solely on leg squeeze → Insufficient pressure on arteries
- Allowing space above shoulders → Opponent can create defensive frames
- Pulling on head only → Strain on your own neck/back

## Training Drills
- Angle creation and adjustment drills
- Triangle entry flow sequences
- Transition chains between triangle and other submissions
- Defense recognition and countering drills
- Hip mobility exercises for triangle optimization

- [[Omoplata Control]] - Related position
- [[Back Control]] - Related position
- [[Side Control]] - Related position

## Decision Tree
If opponent postures up strongly:
- Execute [[Transition to Armbar]]

Else if opponent stacks and pressures forward:
- Execute [[Teepee Adjustment]]

Else if opponent defends with correct hand position:
- Execute [[Transition to Omoplata]]

Else (proper alignment achieved):
- Complete [[Triangle Finish]]

## Position Metrics
- Success Rate: 70% (competition data)
- Average Time to Submission: 45 seconds
- Submission Probability: 68%
- Transition to Other Submission: 25%
- Position Loss Probability: 7%

## Optimal Submission Paths
The shortest path to submission from this position:
[[Triangle Control]] → [[Triangle Finish]] → [[Won by Submission]]

Alternative high-percentage path:
[[Triangle Control]] → [[Arm Manipulation]] → [[Triangle Finish]] → [[Won by Submission]]
