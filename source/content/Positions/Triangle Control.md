## State Properties
- **State ID**: S101
- **Point Value**: 3 (Strong dominant position)
- **Position Type**: Offensive
- **Risk Level**: Medium
- **Energy Cost**: High
- **Time Sustainability**: Short to Medium

## State Description
Triangle Control is a dominant submission position where the bottom player traps the opponent's head and one arm between their legs, forming a triangular configuration with their limbs. This position applies pressure to the carotid arteries when properly executed, creating a blood choke that can lead to a submission victory.

## Key Principles
- Create and maintain a perpendicular angle to opponent
- Squeeze with legs, not just ankles
- Pull head down to eliminate space
- Control opponent's trapped arm and posture
- Maintain pressure on opponent's neck, not face
- Adjust leg triangle for maximum pressure on arteries

## Prerequisites
- Hip mobility and flexibility
- Ability to control opponent's posture
- Understanding of precise angle alignment

## State Invariants
- One of opponent's arms is trapped inside the triangle
- One of opponent's arms is outside the triangle
- Your legs form a figure-four around opponent's neck and trapped arm
- Your angle is perpendicular to opponent

## Defensive Responses (When Opponent Has This State)
- [[Posture Up]] → [[Triangle Escape Position]]
- [[Stack Defense]] → [[Triangle Escape Position]]
- [[Von Flue Counter]] → [[Von Flue Position]]
- [[Hand Fight]] → [[Triangle Escape Position]]

## Offensive Transitions (Available From This State)
- [[Triangle Finish]] → [[Won by Submission]]
- [[Transition to Armbar]] → [[Armbar Control]]
- [[Transition to Omoplata]] → [[Omoplata Control]]
- [[Triangle to Mount]] → [[Mount]]
- [[Triangle to Back]] → [[Back Control]]

## Counter Transitions
- [[Readjust Triangle]] → [[Triangle Control]] (against escape attempts)
- [[Switch to Armbar]] → [[Armbar Control]] (if triangle pressure diminishes)
- [[Teepee Adjustment]] → [[Triangle Control]] (against stack defense)

## Expert Insights
- **Danaher System**: Emphasizes exact mechanical alignment to maximize choking pressure. Focuses on controlling defensive structures before applying the choke, ensuring the triangle is a position of control before becoming a submission.
- **Gordon Ryan**: Uses triangles in combination with arm attacks, frequently switching between threats based on opponent reactions. Prefers to create overwhelming problems through attacking multiple targets rather than forcing any single submission.
- **Eddie Bravo**: Incorporates rubber guard principles into triangle setups, using the "Crackhead Control" and "Zombie" systems to establish dominant angles before applying the triangle. Often uses the triangle as a transitional control position rather than just a submission.

## Common Errors
- Poor angle (staying square to opponent) → Reduced choking pressure
- Crossing ankles incorrectly → Ineffective lock
- Focusing solely on leg squeeze → Insufficient pressure on arteries
- Allowing space above shoulders → Opponent can create defensive frames
- Pulling on head only → Strain on your own neck/back

## Training Drills
- Angle creation and adjustment drills
- Triangle entry flow sequences
- Transition chains between triangle and other submissions
- Defense recognition and countering drills
- Hip mobility exercises for triangle optimization

- [[Omoplata Control]] - Related shoulder lock position
- [[Mounted Triangle]] - Triangle applied from top position
- [[Inverted Triangle]] - Variation with different angle
- [[Triangle Back Control]] - Triangle combined with back control

## Decision Tree
If opponent postures up strongly:
- Execute [[Transition to Armbar]]

Else if opponent stacks and pressures forward:
- Execute [[Teepee Adjustment]]

Else if opponent defends with correct hand position:
- Execute [[Transition to Omoplata]]

Else (proper alignment achieved):
- Complete [[Triangle Finish]]
