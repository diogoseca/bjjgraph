# Backside 50-50 Top
#bjj #state #leg-entanglement #top #no-gi

## State Properties
- **State ID**: S059
- **Point Value**: 0 (Neutral entanglement, but advantageous)
- **Position Type**: Offensive with dominant control
- **Risk Level**: Medium
- **Energy Cost**: Medium
- **Time Sustainability**: Medium

## State Description
Backside 50-50 Top is an advanced leg entanglement position where both practitioners have their legs intertwined, but the top player has their chest against the bottom player's back. This configuration provides significant mechanical and tactical advantages including superior pressure, better leg attack angles, and the constant threat of transitioning to back control.

From the top position in backside 50-50, you can see your opponent's legs more clearly, apply pressure with your chest to limit their movement, and access high-percentage leg locks while also threatening to abandon the leg entanglement entirely to secure back control. This dual-threat nature makes the top position particularly powerful.

Backside 50-50 Top is commonly seen in no-gi competition and leg lock-focused training environments, appearing from successful leg entanglement entries, countered leg attacks, or as a transitional position during scrambles. The position rewards technical leg lock knowledge and the ability to manage multiple attacking options simultaneously.

## Visual Description
You are positioned with your chest against your opponent's back, creating chest-to-back contact that gives you superior pressure and control. Your legs are entangled with your opponent's legs in a mirrored configuration, with your right leg controlling their left leg (or vice versa). Your inside leg hooks around their leg near the knee, while your outside leg controls their hip or wraps around their far leg. You can see both of your opponent's legs clearly, giving you visual advantage for attacking. Your chest weight presses down on their back, making it difficult for them to create the hip movement needed for escapes or sweeps. Your arms are free to control their upper body, threaten back control, or grip their legs for submissions. Your hips are mobile and can adjust angle for leg attacks or move up their body toward back control. The position feels dominant and controlling, with multiple attacking options available while your opponent struggles with limited mobility and back exposure.

## Key Principles
- **Pressure Maintenance**: Constant chest pressure on opponent's back limits their mobility and offensive options
- **Dual Threat System**: Simultaneous threat of leg locks and back control creates difficult defensive decisions
- **Visual Advantage**: Clear view of opponent's legs allows precise leg lock mechanics and timing
- **Hip Control**: Control opponent's hip movement to prevent sweeps while maintaining your attacking mobility
- **Systematic Progression**: Choose between leg lock finish, back control advancement, or pass based on opponent's reactions
- **Base Management**: Maintain solid base to prevent sweeps while working attacks
- **Timing Recognition**: Identify when to commit to submissions versus when to advance position

## Offensive Transitions
From this position, you can execute:

### Leg Attacks
- [[Inside Heel Hook]] → [[Heel Hook Control]] (Success Rate: Beginner 40%, Intermediate 60%, Advanced 80%)
  - Primary leg lock with superior angle and pressure from top position
- [[Kneebar from 50-50]] → [[Kneebar Control]] (Success Rate: Beginner 35%, Intermediate 55%, Advanced 70%)
  - Attack opponent's knee when heel hook is defended
- [[Toe Hold]] → [[Toe Hold Control]] (Success Rate: Beginner 30%, Intermediate 50%, Advanced 65%)
  - Alternative leg attack using foot control
- [[Straight Ankle Lock]] → [[Ankle Lock Control]] (Success Rate: Beginner 35%, Intermediate 50%, Advanced 65%)
  - Basic leg lock option when opponent defends primary attacks

### Position Advancements
- [[Back Take from Legs]] → [[Back Control]] (Success Rate: Beginner 45%, Intermediate 60%, Advanced 75%)
  - Abandon leg entanglement to secure back control (4 points)
- [[Pass to Side Control]] → [[Side Control Top]] (Success Rate: Beginner 40%, Intermediate 55%, Advanced 70%)
  - Extract legs and pass to dominant top position
- [[Mount Transition]] → [[Mount]] (Success Rate: Beginner 30%, Intermediate 45%, Advanced 60%)
  - Advanced transition walking legs up to mount position

### Control Maintenance
- [[Pressure Control]] → [[Backside 50-50 Top Maintained]] (Success Rate: Beginner 50%, Intermediate 65%, Advanced 80%)
  - Maintain dominant top position while opponent cannot improve
- [[Leg Entanglement Control]] → [[Saddle Position Top]] (Success Rate: Beginner 35%, Intermediate 50%, Advanced 70%)
  - Transition to more controlled leg entanglement configuration

## Defensive Responses
When opponent has this position against you (you are on bottom):

- [[Bottom Sweep Attempt]] → [[Position Reversed]] (Success Rate: 35%)
  - Bottom player attempts to use leg entanglement to sweep top player
- [[Standard 50-50 Rotation]] → [[50-50 Guard Bottom]] (Success Rate: 40%)
  - Bottom player rotates to face top player and equalize position
- [[Leg Extraction]] → [[Open Guard Bottom]] (Success Rate: 30%)
  - Bottom player extracts legs to escape entanglement
- [[Counter Leg Attack]] → [[Leg Lock Battle]] (Success Rate: 25%)
  - Bottom player attacks your legs in response to your attacks

## Decision Tree

**If** opponent is flattened on back with limited mobility:
- Execute [[Inside Heel Hook]] → [[Heel Hook Control]] (Probability: 70%)
  - Reasoning: Opponent cannot defend effectively when flattened, high-percentage finish
- Or Execute [[Back Take from Legs]] → [[Back Control]] (Probability: 60%)
  - Reasoning: Static opponent makes back control transition easy and safe

**Else if** opponent attempts to face you or create angles:
- Execute [[Pressure Control]] → [[Backside 50-50 Top Maintained]] (Probability: 65%)
  - Reasoning: Prevent position change by maintaining chest pressure and control
- Or Execute [[Kneebar from 50-50]] → [[Kneebar Control]] (Probability: 55%)
  - Reasoning: Opponent's movement can expose knee to kneebar attack

**Else if** opponent is defending legs but vulnerable on top:
- Execute [[Back Take from Legs]] → [[Back Control]] (Probability: 70%)
  - Reasoning: Opponent focused on leg defense creates back control opportunity
- Or Execute [[Pass to Side Control]] → [[Side Control Top]] (Probability: 60%)
  - Reasoning: Abandon legs for positional advancement when submissions unavailable

**Else** (opponent defending well with active movement):
- Execute [[Leg Entanglement Control]] → [[Saddle Position Top]] (Probability: 50%)
  - Reasoning: Tighten entanglement to reduce opponent's defensive options
- Or Execute [[Inside Heel Hook]] → [[Heel Hook Control]] (Probability: 45%)
  - Reasoning: Attack opportunistically while maintaining control

## Expert Insights

**John Danaher**: "The backside 50-50 top position represents one of the most asymmetrical advantage states in leg entanglements. Both players are technically in a leg lock position, but the mechanical advantages are overwhelmingly in favor of the top player. You have superior pressure, better visual information, more attacking angles, and the constant threat of back control. The bottom player must divide their attention between defending leg attacks and preventing back control - this dual threat is what makes the position so powerful. However, don't be seduced by the leg lock opportunities to the point where you ignore the bigger picture. If the opponent is defending the leg attacks competently, the back take is often the higher percentage option. The best leg lock specialists understand that sometimes the best leg lock finish comes after taking the back first, then returning to the legs from a dominant position. Position before submission - this principle applies even within the leg entanglement game."

**Gordon Ryan**: "When I get to backside 50-50 top, I'm looking at what the opponent is giving me. If they're worried about their back, I attack the legs. If they're defending the legs well, I take their back. It's that simple. The position is so strong because they can't defend both effectively. I've submitted dozens of high-level guys from here, and I've also taken the back from here to set up chokes. The key is not to fall in love with one option. Stay opportunistic. Also, don't let them sweep you - your base needs to be solid even while you're attacking. I see a lot of guys get so focused on the heel hook that they forget their base and get swept. Then they're on bottom and the position is reversed. Keep your chest heavy on their back, maintain your base wide, and pick your moments to really commit to the finish."

**Eddie Bravo**: "Backside 50-50 top is in my system but it's not where we live - we're usually working to saddle or taking the back. But it shows up in scrambles and when you're transitioning between positions, so you gotta know it. When I'm there, I'm thinking about control first. Pin them down, make them carry your weight, then work. If they're new to leg locks, they panic about their legs and forget about their back - boom, take the back, get your hooks, finish with a choke. Way higher percentage than forcing a heel hook against someone defending well. But if they give you the leg, take it. The position is versatile, which is why it works. Just don't stall there - referees hate when both guys are just hanging out in leg locks. Work something."

## Common Errors

### Error: Insufficient chest pressure on opponent's back
- **Consequence**: Allows bottom player to create hip movement and angles, enabling sweeps or position improvements. Without constant pressure, your mechanical advantage disappears and the position neutralizes.
- **Correction**: Maintain heavy, constant chest-to-back pressure throughout all attacking sequences. Your chest should be driving them into the mat, limiting their hip mobility. Even while attacking legs, some portion of your weight should be on their back. Use your hips to drive weight forward.
- **Recognition**: If opponent is creating movement or angles easily, you're not applying enough pressure.

### Error: Ignoring back control opportunities
- **Consequence**: Miss high-percentage position advancement to back control (4 points) while forcing lower-percentage leg lock finishes. Opponent may defend legs successfully while you ignore superior positional option.
- **Correction**: Constantly evaluate back control opportunities. When opponent is defending legs well, look to walk your hips up their body toward back control. Back control is often the smarter choice than forcing leg locks. Be opportunistic and take what opponent gives.
- **Recognition**: If you've attempted multiple leg locks without success and opponent's back is vulnerable, consider position change.

### Error: Poor leg positioning for attacks
- **Consequence**: Leg lock attempts are ineffective, easy to defend, or create openings for opponent to escape or reverse position. Poor mechanics reduce your attacking effectiveness and waste dominant position.
- **Correction**: Study proper heel hook, kneebar, and toe hold mechanics from backside 50-50 specifically. Heel control must be precise, leg configuration must be correct. Don't force submissions with incorrect positioning. Position the submission correctly, then finish.
- **Recognition**: If opponent is easily defending your leg attacks or you're using excessive force, your positioning needs work.

### Error: Neglecting base and sweep defense
- **Consequence**: Bottom player successfully sweeps despite your top position, reversing the advantage completely. All your positional advantage disappears in one defensive failure.
- **Correction**: Maintain wide base with your knees/feet even while attacking. Don't let your base become narrow or elevated. Distribute weight between chest pressure and base points. Feel for opponent's sweep attempts and adjust base preemptively. Base first, submissions second.
- **Recognition**: If you get swept from top position, your base was compromised. Review where your weight was distributed.

### Error: Tunnel vision on one attack
- **Consequence**: Opponent defends your predictable attack while you ignore other openings. Position stagnates or opponent escapes while you focus on single submission. Predictability is defensive failure.
- **Correction**: Maintain multi-attack system - leg locks, back control, passes. Use failed leg lock attempts to create back control opportunities. Chain attacks together. If one submission is defended, immediately flow to next option. Systematic attack progression keeps opponent defending.
- **Recognition**: If opponent successfully defends same attack multiple times, you need to change tactics.

### Error: Stalling without progression
- **Consequence**: Referee intervention (standups in some rulesets) or opponent finds escape during your static position. Dominant positions must be active to remain dominant. Stalling wastes opportunity.
- **Correction**: Constantly work toward finish or position advancement. Even if not immediately attacking, you should be improving position, tightening controls, or setting up next attack. Show progression to referees and maintain pressure on opponent.
- **Recognition**: If nothing is changing for 10-15 seconds and you're not actively attacking, you're stalling.

### Error: Releasing position too early for submissions
- **Consequence**: Opponent escapes during your transition to submission, losing dominant position for failed submission attempt. Premature commitment wastes positional advantage.
- **Correction**: Ensure submission is secured with proper grips and positioning before fully committing and releasing other controls. Maintain some positional control even during submission attempts. If submission isn't there, maintain position rather than forcing it.
- **Recognition**: If opponent frequently escapes during your submission attempts, you're releasing position too early.

## Training Drills

### Drill 1: Pressure Maintenance and Base
Start in backside 50-50 top with partner in bottom. Partner provides 50% resistance trying to create movement and sweep. Your goal is to maintain heavy chest pressure while keeping solid base to prevent sweeps. Practice distributing weight between chest pressure and base points. Partner gradually increases sweep attempts (50%, 75%, 90%). Focus on feeling sweep attempts early and adjusting base proactively. 5 minutes continuous, then switch roles.

### Drill 2: Attack Options Flow
From backside 50-50 top, flow through all attacking options: inside heel hook setup, kneebar transition, back take progression, pass entry. Partner provides light resistance (30%) but doesn't fully defend. Goal is to develop smooth transitions between different attacks and understand connections. Emphasize decision points - when to pursue leg locks versus when to advance position. 7 minutes continuous flow, switch roles.

### Drill 3: Back Take Timing and Execution
Partner in backside 50-50 bottom defends legs by hand fighting and hip movement. Your goal is to recognize back control opportunities created by their leg defense and execute back take transition. Start at 60% intensity. Focus on timing - when to abandon legs for back control. Practice walking hips up body, securing seat belt control, and establishing hooks. 3-minute rounds, rest 1 minute, 5 rounds total, switch roles each round.

### Drill 4: Leg Lock Chains from Top
With partner providing increasing resistance (start 40%, progress to 70%), practice chaining leg lock attacks. Inside heel hook to kneebar, heel hook to toe hold, kneebar to straight ankle lock. Focus on using opponent's defense of one attack to set up the next. Partner provides realistic defense but doesn't escape position. Emphasize smooth transitions and maintaining control throughout attack chains. 4 minutes per side, slow and technical.

### Drill 5: Live Positional Sparring
Start in backside 50-50 top, full intensity. Your goals: submit, take back, or pass. Partner's goals: sweep, escape, or counter-attack legs. Reset after major position change. This builds specific conditioning, timing, and realistic problem-solving. Both partners working at competition intensity. 2-minute rounds, 1-minute rest, 6-8 rounds, switch starting positions (top/bottom) each round.

## Optimal Submission Paths

**Fastest path to submission** (direct):
[[Backside 50-50 Top]] → [[Inside Heel Hook]] → [[Heel Hook Control]] → [[Won by Submission]]
*Reasoning: Direct attack with superior angle and pressure. High percentage when opponent is flattened. Primary finishing option from this position.*

**High-percentage path** (positional advancement):
[[Backside 50-50 Top]] → [[Back Take from Legs]] → [[Back Control]] → [[Rear Naked Choke]] → [[Won by Submission]]
*Reasoning: Advance to 4-point position with superior control, then finish with choke. Often higher percentage than forcing leg locks against strong defense.*

**Alternative submission path** (leg lock chain):
[[Backside 50-50 Top]] → [[Inside Heel Hook Attempt]] → [[Kneebar Transition]] → [[Kneebar Control]] → [[Won by Submission]]
*Reasoning: Use opponent's heel hook defense to set up kneebar. Chaining attacks increases success rate by creating dilemmas.*

**Control and finish path** (systematic):
[[Backside 50-50 Top]] → [[Saddle Position Top]] → [[Leg Lock Control]] → [[Inside Heel Hook]] → [[Won by Submission]]
*Reasoning: Tighten entanglement to more controlled saddle position before finishing. Danaher's systematic approach - maximum control before submission.*

**Pass and dominate path** (positional):
[[Backside 50-50 Top]] → [[Pass to Side Control]] → [[Mount]] → [[Submission from Mount]] → [[Won by Submission]]
*Reasoning: Extract from legs to establish traditional dominance, then finish from mount. Conservative approach when leg attacks are unavailable.*

## Position Metrics
- **Position Retention Rate**: Beginner 55%, Intermediate 70%, Advanced 85%
- **Advancement Probability**: Beginner 50%, Intermediate 65%, Advanced 80%
- **Submission Probability**: Beginner 35%, Intermediate 55%, Advanced 75%
- **Position Loss Probability**: Beginner 35%, Intermediate 20%, Advanced 10%
- **Average Time in Position**: 30-90 seconds (transitional but controllable)

## Competition Considerations

**Point Scoring**: Backside 50-50 is neutral (0 points) in IBJJF and ADCC until you establish back control (4 points) or pass (3 points). The leg entanglement itself scores nothing, but transitions from it score normally.

**Time Management**: Use this position actively - work toward finish, back control, or pass. Referees will stand up competitors who stall in leg entanglements without progression. Show constant attacking intent.

**Rule Set Adaptations**: In IBJJF gi competition, heel hooks are illegal at most belt levels, limiting your leg attack options significantly. Focus on back control transitions and legal leg locks (straight ankle lock, kneebar where allowed). In ADCC and no-gi submission-only, full leg lock game is available - exploit the positional advantage completely.

**Competition Strategy**: Against opponents weaker at leg locks, attack legs aggressively. Against leg lock specialists, consider taking back control rather than engaging in leg lock exchanges where they may be more technical. Against guard passers, leg entanglements may frustrate their preferred game - use position to slow their pace and create submission opportunities they're less familiar with defending.

## Historical Context

Backside 50-50 gained prominence in modern no-gi competition through the development of systematic leg lock approaches, particularly the Danaher Death Squad's emphasis on leg entanglements. While traditional BJJ largely ignored leg locks, modern competitors recognized the positional advantages of controlling opponents through leg entanglements, with backside 50-50 top representing one of the most favorable configurations. The position exemplifies the evolution of BJJ toward systematic leg lock games and away from leg locks as purely opportunistic submissions.
