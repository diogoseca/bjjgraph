## State Properties

- **Position Type**: Defensive with strong offensive options
- **Risk Level**: Medium to High
- **Energy Cost**: Medium to High
- **Time Sustainability**: Medium

## State Description
Open Guard is a dynamic family of guard positions where the bottom player's legs are not closed around the opponent, allowing for greater mobility and attack variety at the cost of some defensive security. This position offers exceptional offensive versatility through numerous variations (butterfly, spider, lasso, de la riva, etc.), creating a complex strategic landscape. Open Guard serves as both a starting point for sweeps and submissions and as a transitional hub connecting various guard systems.

## Key Principles
- Maintain active foot and hand engagement
- Control distance and angles through framing and leg positioning
- Prevent opponent from establishing dominant grips or pressure
- Create and exploit leverage through strategic hooks and grips
- Connect upper and lower body control systems
- Constantly threaten multiple attack vectors simultaneously

## Prerequisites
- Hip mobility and leg dexterity
- Understanding of grip fighting fundamentals
- Basic framing mechanics
- Ability to manage distance

## State Invariants
- Legs are open and actively engaged with opponent
- Not in a fully passed position
- Maintaining some form of barrier between you and opponent
- Control of either sleeve/collar/ankle/knee or combination

## Defensive Responses (When Opponent Has This State)
- [[Pressure Passing]] → [[Headquarters Position]]
- [[Toreando Attempt]] → [[Guard Pass]]
- [[Leg Drag Entry]] → [[Leg Drag Position]]
- [[Stack Passing]] → [[Stack Pass]]
- [[Standing Guard Break]] → [[Standing Pass Sequence]]

## Offensive Transitions (Available From This State)
- [[Butterfly Sweep]] → [[Top Position]]
- [[Scissor Sweep]] → [[Mount]] or [[Side Control Top]]
- [[Single Leg X Entry]] → [[Single Leg X Guard]]
- [[De La Riva Entry]] → [[De La Riva Guard]]
- [[Spider Guard Transition]] → [[Spider Guard]]
- [[Triangle Setup from Open Guard]] → [[Triangle Control]]
- [[Omoplata from Open Guard]] → [[Omoplata Control]]
- [[Closed Guard Recovery]] → [[Closed Guard Bottom]]
- [[X-Guard Entry]] → [[X-Guard]]

## Counter Transitions
- [[Guard Retention]] → [[Open Guard Bottom]] (against pass attempts)
- [[Re-guard Sequence]] → [[Open Guard Bottom]] (from compromised positions)
- [[Inversion]] → [[Inverted Guard]] (to counter specific pass types)

## Expert Insights
- **Danaher System**: Emphasizes a systematic approach to open guard with clear defensive hierarchies. Focuses on establishing inside foot positioning and constructing frames that prevent the opponent from gaining chest-to-chest connection. Creates methodical transitions between guard types based on the opponent's reactions.
- **Gordon Ryan**: Utilizes a highly adaptable open guard system focused on rapid transitions between butterfly, seated guard, and leg entanglements. Emphasizes offensive pressure and forward momentum, often creating "false retreats" that bait opponents into aggressive passing attempts which set up counters.
- **Eddie Bravo**: Developed specialized open guard variations like the rubber guard system, focusing on creating unconventional control patterns that facilitate unique submission entries. Often connects open guard directly to the "Lockdown" half guard variation rather than maintaining traditional open guard.

## Common Errors
- Passive legs/feet → Easily bypassed barriers
- Overextending arms → Vulnerability to grip breaks and armbars
- Disconnected upper and lower body → Passing lanes
- Static positioning → Predictable patterns
- Poor distance management → Vulnerability to pressure and smashing

## Training Drills
- Open guard retention with progressive passing pressure
- Transition flows between guard variations
- Distance management cycles
- Grip fighting sequences
- False retreat to counter-attack drills

## Related States
- [[Butterfly Guard]] - Open guard with hooks under opponent's thighs
- [[De La Riva Guard]] - Open guard with outside hook and ankle control
- [[Spider Guard]] - Open guard with sleeve control and foot placement on biceps
- [[Lasso Guard]] - Open guard with sleeve wrap and leg positioning
- [[Seated Guard]] - Upright open guard position
- [[X-Guard]] - Open guard with leg positioning under and around opponent's leg
- [[Single Leg X]] - Modified X-guard targeting one leg

## Decision Tree
If opponent stands tall:
- Execute [[De La Riva Entry]] or [[Single Leg X Entry]]

Else if opponent pressures forward in crouch:
- Execute [[Butterfly Sweep]] or [[Guillotine Setup]]

Else if opponent establishes double unders:
- Execute [[Counter Double Unders]] → [[Back Take]]

Else if opponent attempts leg drag:
- Execute [[Inversion]] → [[Inverted Guard]] or [[Leg Entanglement]]

## Position Metrics
- Success Rate: 60% retention (competition data)
- Average Time in Position: 1-3 minutes
- Sweep Probability: 45%
- Submission Probability: 25%
- Position Loss Probability: 30%

## Optimal Paths
High-percentage sweeping path:
[[Open Guard Bottom]] → [[Butterfly Guard]] → [[Butterfly Sweep]] → [[Top Position]] → [[Side Control]] → [[Mount]] → [[Arm Triangle]] → [[Won by Submission]]

Submission-oriented path:
[[Open Guard Bottom]] → [[Spider Guard]] → [[Triangle Setup from Open Guard]] → [[Triangle Control]] → [[Triangle Finish]] → [[Won by Submission]]

Leg lock entry path:
[[Open Guard Bottom]] → [[Single Leg X Entry]] → [[Single Leg X Guard]] → [[Ashi Garami]] → [[Inside Heel Hook]] → [[Won by Submission]]

## Computer Science Analogy
Open Guard represents a hub node with extremely high connectivity in the BJJ state machine graph. It functions as a "router" between various guard subsystems, offering multiple pathways based on the opponent's actions. This makes it a critical decision point with maximum optionality, allowing dynamic redirection to multiple attack vectors.
