# Truck Position Bottom
#bjj #state #truck #bottom #defensive #10thplanet

## State Properties
- **State ID**: S092
- **Point Value**: 0 (Back attack position, opponent scores back points)
- **Position Type**: Defensive survival position
- **Risk Level**: High
- **Energy Cost**: High
- **Time Sustainability**: Short

## State Description
The Truck Position Bottom is a highly disadvantageous position where you are on your side with your legs entangled and your back exposed to the opponent who controls your body with a boot-to-hip grip and various upper body controls. This position, popularized by Eddie Bravo and the 10th Planet Jiu-Jitsu system, creates severe submission threats including the twister (spinal lock), calf slicer, and banana split. The configuration involves your lower leg being trapped while the opponent uses their foot (boot) against your hip to create torque and control your body orientation.

Being in truck bottom is a survival situation requiring immediate defensive action. The position's danger comes from the combination of leg entanglement restricting mobility, back exposure limiting defensive options, and the unique angle that allows the opponent to attack both your spine and lower body simultaneously. Understanding truck bottom defense is essential for modern BJJ practitioners, as the position has become increasingly common in competition.

### Visual Description
You are on your side in a tightly entangled position with your opponent behind and partially on top of you. Your lower leg is trapped and bent, often with your heel near your own buttocks, while your upper leg is controlled by the opponent's boot (foot) pushing against your hip or thigh. Your back is exposed to the opponent who typically has one arm controlling your upper body (often reaching for your far shoulder or neck for twister control) while their other hand works to secure grips. Your torso is twisted due to the leg entanglement and boot pressure, creating a corkscrew effect through your body. Your mobility is severely restricted—you cannot easily turn to face the opponent, and your legs are tangled in a way that prevents normal bridging or shrimping movements. Your arms are typically defending your neck and trying to address the boot control, creating a defensive shell. This configuration leaves you vulnerable to spinal attacks, leg attacks, and back control consolidation, making it one of the most dangerous positions in modern BJJ.

## Key Principles
- **Neck Protection Priority**: Defend against twister and neck attacks first
- **Boot Addressing**: Clear the controlling boot to reduce torque
- **Leg Straightening**: Work to extend trapped leg to reduce entanglement
- **Roll Through Escape**: Use granby roll or back roll mechanics
- **Tap Early Mindset**: Accept defeat before injury when caught in submissions
- **Calm Under Pressure**: Panic accelerates exhaustion and submission

## Prerequisites
- Understanding of granby roll mechanics
- Experience with back defense fundamentals
- Knowledge of leg entanglement escapes
- Awareness of submission dangers

## State Invariants
- On your side with back exposed
- Lower leg trapped and bent
- Opponent's boot controlling hip/thigh
- Limited mobility due to entanglement
- High submission danger

- [[Boot Clear]] → [[Leg Untangle]] (Success Rate: 45%)
- [[Granby Roll Escape]] → [[Guard Recovery]] (Success Rate: 35%)
- [[Back Roll Escape]] → [[Top Position]] (Success Rate: 30%)

- [[Defensive Hold]] → [[Truck Position Bottom]] (stalling for time/referee intervention)

## Expert Insights
- **John Danaher**: "The truck represents a positional evolution that exploits the gap between traditional back defense and leg entanglement defense. The bottom player faces a unique problem: their back defense instincts tell them to face away from the opponent, but this plays directly into the truck's submission mechanics. The key to defending is recognizing the position early and prioritizing the boot control removal—without the boot creating hip pressure, the entire position collapses. However, I must emphasize that this is a position to avoid rather than defend from, as the submission threats are severe and the escape windows are narrow."

- **Gordon Ryan**: "I don't spend much time drilling truck bottom defense because my entire game is built around never getting there in the first place. When teaching truck defense, I emphasize two things: first, tap early to the twister and calf slicer because they can injure you seriously and quickly, and second, address the boot immediately before they can establish upper body control. If I ever end up in truck bottom in competition, my strategy is simple—defend the immediate submissions and look for the first opportunity to granby roll out. Staying in the truck is not an option; you either escape quickly or tap."

- **Eddie Bravo**: "The truck is a 10th Planet signature position, so I've taught both sides extensively. From bottom, the hardest part is overcoming the psychological pressure—it's an unfamiliar position that feels extremely vulnerable. The defense requires staying calm and following a systematic approach: protect your neck first, then work on the boot, then execute the escape roll. Many students panic and tire themselves out trying to muscle through, which is exactly what the top player wants. The granby roll is your friend here, but you need to time it when the top player commits to an attack, using their aggression against them. Most importantly, recognize when you're caught—the twister especially can cause serious injury, so tap early and reset."

## Common Errors
- **Error**: Panicking and burning energy with frantic movements
  - **Consequence**: Rapid exhaustion leaves you defenseless against submissions and unable to execute escape sequences.
  - **Correction**: Breathe calmly, prioritize neck protection, and work systematically through escape steps without wasting energy.
  - **Recognition**: If you're breathing hard and feeling weak after 10-15 seconds, you're panicking.

- **Error**: Ignoring the boot control
  - **Consequence**: Boot creates the torque necessary for all truck submissions; ignoring it makes escape nearly impossible.
  - **Correction**: Address the boot early by grabbing it and working to peel it off your hip.
  - **Recognition**: If opponent easily controls your orientation, the boot is doing its job.

- **Error**: Trying to turn to face opponent
  - **Consequence**: Plays directly into twister mechanics, tightening the spinal lock and making submission more likely.
  - **Correction**: Don't fight the rotation; instead work to roll through it (granby roll direction).
  - **Recognition**: If you feel increasing spinal pressure when turning, you're making the error.

- **Error**: Waiting too long to tap
  - **Consequence**: Risk of serious injury to spine (twister), calf, or groin/hip (banana split).
  - **Correction**: Tap as soon as you feel locked submission pressure—these attacks can injure you quickly.
  - **Recognition**: Any pain in spine, calf, or groin is tap signal.

- **Error**: Neglecting neck defense for leg escape
  - **Consequence**: Opponent secures twister control while you work on leg escape, leading to immediate submission.
  - **Correction**: Always prioritize neck/twister defense as first defensive layer.
  - **Recognition**: If opponent gets hand to your far shoulder/neck, you neglected priority one.

## Training Drills
- **Truck Escape Progressions**: Start in truck with partner providing light control, practice granby roll escapes with progressive resistance (25%, 50%, 75%).

- **Boot Defense Drill**: Partner establishes boot control, you practice clearing and maintaining clear while they attempt to reestablish.

- **Twister Defense Drill**: Partner attempts twister setup slowly, you practice defensive hand fighting and positioning to prevent completion.

- **Positional Sparring**: Start from truck bottom, work to escape while partner works to submit, 2-minute rounds with focus on survival and escape.

- **Emergency Tap Training**: Partner gradually applies twister and calf slicer pressure, you develop awareness of when pressure becomes dangerous and practice tapping early.
