# Electric Chair
#bjj #state #submission #10thplanet #halfguard

## State Properties
- **State ID**: S041
- **Point Value**: 2 (Advantageous control/submission position)
- **Position Type**: Half guard sweep/submission position
- **Risk Level**: Low
- **Energy Cost**: Medium
- **Time Sustainability**: Medium

## State Description
The Electric Chair is a specialized half guard position and submission developed within Eddie Bravo's 10th Planet Jiu-Jitsu system. This position begins from a bottom half guard configuration where the practitioner secures a lockdown on the opponent's trapped leg while simultaneously controlling the opponent's opposite leg. When properly executed, this creates a powerful submission threat that applies pressure to the opponent's inner thigh and groin area through a form of leg/hamstring stretching. Beyond its submission potential, the Electric Chair also functions as an exceptionally effective sweeping mechanism, providing bottom half guard players with a powerful offensive weapon against larger opponents. The position has become one of the signature techniques of the 10th Planet system.

### Visual Description
You are on your back in a bottom half guard position, with your legs forming a tight lockdown around the opponent's trapped leg, creating a figure-four grip that immobilizes their ankle and knee, preventing them from pulling out. Your arms reach across to control their free leg, often gripping behind their knee or ankle, pulling it towards you to create a stretching angle that applies intense pressure to their inner thigh and groin area. Your upper body is slightly turned towards their free leg, using your shoulder or chest to maintain connection and prevent them from posturing up, while your hips are active, ready to drive or elevate to execute a sweep or increase submission pressure. The opponent, typically on their knees, is caught in an awkward position with one leg locked down and the other stretched out, their balance compromised as they struggle to defend against both the submission threat and the potential sweep, often with their hands posted on the mat for base.

## Key Principles
- Establish and maintain strong lockdown control on opponent's trapped leg
- Secure control of opponent's free leg to create stretching leverage
- Create proper angle for maximum pressure on opponent's inner thigh/groin
- Apply synchronized pulling/pushing mechanics for optimal submission pressure
- Maintain upper body control to prevent defensive counters
- Use opponent's defensive reactions to facilitate sweeps
- Coordinate hip movement with leg controls for dynamic attacks

## Prerequisites
- Understanding of lockdown half guard mechanics
- Hip mobility and leg dexterity
- Recognition of entry opportunities
- Knowledge of connected systems and transitions

## State Invariants
- Bottom half guard position with lockdown engaged
- Control of opponent's non-trapped leg
- Angular pressure creating stretching tension

## Expert Insights
- **Danaher System**: While not a core position in the Danaher system, acknowledges the Electric Chair's effectiveness as both a control position and submission threat from bottom half guard. Emphasizes understanding the precise mechanical details that make the position effective, particularly the relationship between the lockdown control and the free leg manipulation.
- **Gordon Ryan**: Generally prefers other half guard configurations but recognizes the Electric Chair's effectiveness, particularly as a sweeping mechanism against larger opponents. When utilizing the position, emphasizes maintaining control throughout the sweeping motion to prevent scrambles and ensure dominant position upon completion.
- **Eddie Bravo**: As the primary developer of the Electric Chair within the 10th Planet system, considers it one of the cornerstone techniques of his half guard approach. Emphasizes the position's versatility as both a submission and a pathway to other 10th Planet-specific positions like the Truck and Vaporizer, viewing it as a central hub in his grappling system.

## Common Errors
- **Error**: Insufficient lockdown control
  - **Consequence**: Leads to loss of foundational control, as a weak lockdown allows the opponent to pull their leg free or initiate a pass.
  - **Correction**: Ensure a tight figure-four grip with your legs, locking their ankle and knee securely to prevent any movement.
- **Error**: Poor angle creation
  - **Consequence**: Results in reduced submission effectiveness, as improper alignment fails to apply maximum pressure to the opponent's inner thigh or groin.
  - **Correction**: Turn your body towards their free leg and pull it across to create the optimal stretching angle for the submission.
- **Error**: Inadequate free leg control
  - **Consequence**: Allows defensive mobility, as the opponent can use their free leg to base out or counter your sweep or submission.
  - **Correction**: Secure a strong grip behind their knee or ankle, pulling it towards you to maintain control and limit their options.
- **Error**: Premature submission attempts
  - **Consequence**: Leads to loss of control, as rushing the submission without proper setup can cause you to overextend and lose the position.
  - **Correction**: Focus on establishing all control points (lockdown, free leg, upper body) before applying submission pressure.
- **Error**: Neglecting upper body connection
  - **Consequence**: Allows opponent posture maintenance, as failing to control their upper body lets them posture up and defend or pass.
  - **Correction**: Use your shoulder or chest to maintain connection with their torso, keeping them bent forward to disrupt their posture.

## Training Drills
- **Electric Chair Entry**: Practice Electric Chair entry and control maintenance against progressive resistance, focusing on securing a tight lockdown and free leg control.
- **Transition Flows**: Drill transition flows between Electric Chair and related positions like Truck or Dogfight, ensuring smooth movement options.
- **Pressure Application**: Work on incremental pressure application with controlled feedback, learning to apply submission pressure without losing control.
- **Sweep Mechanics**: Train sweep mechanics against varying opponent weights, enhancing your ability to execute sweeps from the position.
- **Defensive Recognition**: Engage in defensive recognition and counter drills, learning to anticipate and neutralize opponent escapes or counters.

## Historical Context
The Electric Chair was developed by Eddie Bravo as part of his 10th Planet Jiu-Jitsu system, evolving from his lockdown half guard approach. The technique represented an innovative approach to creating powerful offensive options from the traditionally defensive half guard position. While initially viewed skeptically by traditional BJJ practitioners, the Electric Chair has gained wider acceptance as its effectiveness has been demonstrated in both sport grappling and MMA contexts. The position exemplifies the 10th Planet philosophy of creating unorthodox, high-leverage techniques that exploit biomechanical advantages.

## Computer Science Analogy
The Electric Chair represents a "constraint optimization algorithm" in the BJJ state graph, where multiple control variables (lockdown tension, free leg manipulation, angle creation) must be simultaneously optimized to produce maximum mechanical advantage. This implements a form of "force multiplication system" where relatively small inputs from the controlling player are amplified through proper mechanical alignment to create disproportionately large outputs (submission pressure or sweeping leverage). The position exemplifies a clever exploitation of the physical system's constraints to create advantageous state transitions.
