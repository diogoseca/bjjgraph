## State Description
The Electric Chair is a specialized half guard position and submission developed within Eddie Bravo's 10th Planet Jiu-Jitsu system. This position begins from a bottom half guard configuration where the practitioner secures a lockdown on the opponent's trapped leg while simultaneously controlling the opponent's opposite leg. When properly executed, this creates a powerful submission threat that applies pressure to the opponent's inner thigh and groin area through a form of leg/hamstring stretching. Beyond its submission potential, the Electric Chair also functions as an exceptionally effective sweeping mechanism, providing bottom half guard players with a powerful offensive weapon against larger opponents. The position has become one of the signature techniques of the 10th Planet system.

## Key Principles
- Establish and maintain strong lockdown control on opponent's trapped leg
- Secure control of opponent's free leg to create stretching leverage
- Create proper angle for maximum pressure on opponent's inner thigh/groin
- Apply synchronized pulling/pushing mechanics for optimal submission pressure
- Maintain upper body control to prevent defensive counters
- Use opponent's defensive reactions to facilitate sweeps
- Coordinate hip movement with leg controls for dynamic attacks

## Prerequisites
- Understanding of lockdown half guard mechanics
- Hip mobility and leg dexterity
- Recognition of entry opportunities
- Knowledge of connected systems and transitions

## State Invariants
- Bottom half guard position with lockdown engaged
- Control of opponent's non-trapped leg
- Angular pressure creating stretching tension
- Upper body connection with opponent
- Opponent's legs in compromised alignment

## Defensive Responses (When Opponent Has This State)
- [[Posture and Base]] → [[Base Maintenance]]
- [[Whizzer Control]] → [[Whizzer Defense]]
- [[Free Trapped Leg]] → [[Half Guard Pass]]
- [[Combat Base Recovery]] → [[Combat Base]]
- [[Forward Pressure]] → [[Flattening Pressure]]

## Offensive Transitions (Available From This State)
- [[Electric Chair Submission]] → [[Won by Submission]]
- [[Electric Chair Sweep]] → [[Top Position]]
- [[Vaporizer Entry]] → [[Vaporizer Control]]
- [[Transition to Truck]] → [[Truck Position]]
- [[Dogfight Entry]] → [[Dogfight Position]]
- [[Switch to Honey Hole]] → [[Inside Sankaku]]
- [[Clamp to Lockdown Sweep]] → [[Top Position]]
- [[Old School Sweep Combo]] → [[Top Position]]

## Counter Transitions
- [[Re-establish Electric Chair]] → [[Electric Chair]] (against escapes)
- [[Retreat to Lockdown]] → [[Lockdown Guard]] (if position is compromised)
- [[Switch to Deep Half]] → [[Deep Half Guard]] (under pressure)

## Expert Insights
- **Danaher System**: While not a core position in the Danaher system, acknowledges the Electric Chair's effectiveness as both a control position and submission threat from bottom half guard. Emphasizes understanding the precise mechanical details that make the position effective, particularly the relationship between the lockdown control and the free leg manipulation.
- **Gordon Ryan**: Generally prefers other half guard configurations but recognizes the Electric Chair's effectiveness, particularly as a sweeping mechanism against larger opponents. When utilizing the position, emphasizes maintaining control throughout the sweeping motion to prevent scrambles and ensure dominant position upon completion.
- **Eddie Bravo**: As the primary developer of the Electric Chair within the 10th Planet system, considers it one of the cornerstone techniques of his half guard approach. Emphasizes the position's versatility as both a submission and a pathway to other 10th Planet-specific positions like the Truck and Vaporizer, viewing it as a central hub in his grappling system.

## Common Errors
- Insufficient lockdown control → Loss of foundational control
- Poor angle creation → Reduced submission effectiveness
- Inadequate free leg control → Defensive mobility
- Premature submission attempts → Loss of control
- Neglecting upper body connection → Opponent posture maintenance

## Training Drills
- Electric Chair entry and control maintenance against progressive resistance
- Transition flows between Electric Chair and related positions
- Incremental pressure application with controlled feedback
- Sweep mechanics against varying opponent weights
- Defensive recognition and counter drills

## Decision Tree
If opponent posts strongly with hands:
- Execute [[Electric Chair Sweep]] or [[Clamp to Lockdown Sweep]]

Else if opponent drives forward with pressure:
- Execute [[Electric Chair Submission]] or [[Vaporizer Entry]]

Else if opponent attempts to free trapped leg:
- Execute [[Transition to Truck]] or [[Switch to Honey Hole]]

Else if opponent elevates for guard pass:
- Execute [[Dogfight Entry]] or [[Old School Sweep Combo]]

## Historical Context
The Electric Chair was developed by Eddie Bravo as part of his 10th Planet Jiu-Jitsu system, evolving from his lockdown half guard approach. The technique represented an innovative approach to creating powerful offensive options from the traditionally defensive half guard position. While initially viewed skeptically by traditional BJJ practitioners, the Electric Chair has gained wider acceptance as its effectiveness has been demonstrated in both sport grappling and MMA contexts. The position exemplifies the 10th Planet philosophy of creating unorthodox, high-leverage techniques that exploit biomechanical advantages.

## Computer Science Analogy
The Electric Chair represents a "constraint optimization algorithm" in the BJJ state graph, where multiple control variables (lockdown tension, free leg manipulation, angle creation) must be simultaneously optimized to produce maximum mechanical advantage. This implements a form of "force multiplication system" where relatively small inputs from the controlling player are amplified through proper mechanical alignment to create disproportionately large outputs (submission pressure or sweeping leverage). The position exemplifies a clever exploitation of the physical system's constraints to create advantageous state transitions.
