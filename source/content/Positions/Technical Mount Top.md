# Technical Mount Top
#bjj #state #mount #top #submission

## State Properties
- **State ID**: S048
- **Point Value**: 4 (Mount position)
- **Position Type**: Offensive transitional mount variation
- **Risk Level**: Medium
- **Energy Cost**: Low
- **Time Sustainability**: Short (transitional position)

## State Description
Technical Mount Top is a specialized mount variation where the top player posts one leg out (shin perpendicular to the opponent's body) while keeping the other leg hooked underneath the opponent, creating an asymmetric base that facilitates armbar attacks and back takes. Unlike traditional mount where both knees are on the mat for control, Technical Mount sacrifices some stability to create optimal angles for finishing submissions and transitions. The position is fundamentally transitional in nature—it's entered with specific attacking intent and should quickly resolve into either a submission finish, back control, or return to regular mount.

The posted leg in Technical Mount serves multiple functions: it provides base against rolling attempts, creates the proper angle for armbar entries, and positions the body for swinging over to complete the submission. The position emerged as practitioners recognized that the defensive reaction of extending an arm while being mounted creates a natural opportunity to transition into an attacking posture. In modern BJJ, Technical Mount is considered an essential skill for mount offense, particularly for smaller practitioners who may struggle to maintain traditional mount against larger, stronger opponents.

### Visual Description
You are in mount position with one significant modification: your outside leg (typically the one on the side of the attacked arm) is posted out with your shin perpendicular to the opponent's body and your foot flat on the mat, creating a stable base. Your inside leg remains hooked underneath the opponent's body, with your knee near their armpit and your foot typically tucked under their back or hip. Your weight is distributed across your posted leg and inside knee, with your hips somewhat elevated compared to traditional mount. Your hands control the opponent's extended arm, with one hand typically gripping their wrist and the other controlling above their elbow or at their shoulder. Your upper body is positioned over the opponent's chest but shifted toward the attacked arm side, creating an angle that naturally sets up the armbar. Your head is typically on the opposite side of the attacked arm, providing additional control and preventing them from sitting up. The posted leg creates a stabilizing pillar that prevents the opponent from rolling you over while simultaneously positioning your body for the armbar swing-over motion. This configuration creates a position where you maintain control while being perfectly positioned for high-percentage submissions.

## Key Principles
- **Posted Leg Base**: Outside leg creates stabilizing tripod structure
- **Arm Isolation**: Control opponent's extended arm with both hands
- **Hip Position**: Elevated hips facilitate quick transitions to submissions
- **Weight Distribution**: Balance across posted leg and inside knee
- **Transitional Mindset**: Position entered with specific finishing intent
- **Angular Control**: Body positioned at angle optimal for armbar or back take
- **Quick Execution**: Minimize time in position to prevent defensive recovery

## Expert Insights
- **John Danaher**: "Technical Mount represents the intersection of positional control and submission attack—it's a liminal state where you're neither fully controlling nor fully attacking, but perfectly positioned for both. The key insight is understanding that this position exists specifically because the opponent has made a defensive error—they've extended their arm. Your goal is to capitalize on this error before they can recover. The posted leg serves as both a stabilizing structure and a launching platform for the armbar swing-over. Many practitioners make the error of trying to maintain Technical Mount as a control position, but it should be viewed as a waypoint on the path to either armbar finish or back control. The moment you achieve Technical Mount, the clock is ticking on your attack—execute quickly or return to mount."

- **Gordon Ryan**: "I use Technical Mount primarily as an armbar entry rather than a position I consciously seek. When someone extends their arm defensively from mount, I immediately transition to Technical Mount and attack the armbar. The key is not telegraphing the transition—I maintain mount pressure and control right up until the moment I post my leg and swing over. In no-gi especially, Technical Mount is brief because opponents can recover their arm quickly without gi grips slowing them down. My sequence is: feel the arm extend, secure wrist and elbow control, post leg out, swing over—all in one fluid motion. If they defend the armbar by pulling their arm back, that's when I take the back, as their defensive reaction naturally exposes it. The position is about creating a dilemma: defend the armbar and expose the back, or defend the back and give up the arm."

- **Eddie Bravo**: "Technical Mount fits into the 10th Planet system as a gateway to several finishing positions. We connect it to both the traditional armbar and to our truck system entries. When the opponent defends the armbar by turning, we're ready to immediately transition to the back or truck, creating submission chains they can't defend. The posted leg position is also useful for setting up the reverse triangle from mount—when they defend the armbar, we can bring our posted leg over their head for the triangle. The key innovation is recognizing that Technical Mount isn't just about the armbar—it's about creating a decision tree where every defensive option leads to a different submission or positional threat. We drill Technical Mount not as a static position but as a dynamic transition point in our submission chains."

## Common Errors
- **Error**: Staying in Technical Mount too long without attacking
  - **Consequence**: Gives opponent time to recover their arm and establish defensive frames, eliminating the submission opportunities that Technical Mount creates.
  - **Correction**: Enter Technical Mount with immediate attacking intent—armbar swing-over or back take should begin within 2-3 seconds of establishing the position.
  - **Recognition**: If you feel static or opponent seems comfortable, you're hesitating too long.

- **Error**: Insufficient arm control before posting leg
  - **Consequence**: Opponent can retract their extended arm while you're transitioning, losing the attacking opportunity and potentially losing mount position entirely.
  - **Correction**: Secure strong control of both wrist and elbow/shoulder before posting your leg out, ensuring arm is isolated before transitioning.
  - **Recognition**: If opponent easily pulls their arm back as you post, your control was insufficient.

- **Error**: Posted leg too far from body
  - **Consequence**: Reduces base stability and makes you vulnerable to rolling attempts, while also creating poor armbar angle that's difficult to finish.
  - **Correction**: Keep posted shin relatively close to opponent's body (within 12-18 inches), maintaining tripod base structure.
  - **Recognition**: If you feel unstable or opponent can easily bridge you over, your posted leg is too far out.

- **Error**: Incorrect weight distribution
  - **Consequence**: Either too much weight on posted leg (losing control) or too much on inside leg (easy to roll), creating instability in both cases.
  - **Correction**: Balance weight approximately 60% on posted leg, 40% on inside knee, adjusting based on opponent's movements.
  - **Recognition**: If you feel light and easily moved, or if opponent can bridge effectively, weight distribution is wrong.

- **Error**: Not committing to the armbar swing-over
  - **Consequence**: Half-hearted armbar attempts give opponent time to defend and recover, wasting the opportunity created by Technical Mount.
  - **Correction**: Once arm control is secured and leg is posted, commit fully to swinging over and dropping back for the armbar.
  - **Recognition**: If you're hesitating at the swing-over point, you lack commitment.

- **Error**: Ignoring back take opportunities
  - **Consequence**: Opponent successfully defends armbar by turning, but you miss the back take that this defense creates.
  - **Correction**: Read opponent's defensive direction—when they turn away from the armbar, immediately transition to back control.
  - **Recognition**: If opponent escapes mount when defending armbar, you missed the back take cue.

## Training Drills
- **Technical Mount Entry Drill**: From regular mount, partner extends arm defensively while you practice smooth transition to Technical Mount, focusing on arm control before posting leg.

- **Armbar Finish Drill**: From established Technical Mount, drill complete armbar sequence with progressive resistance (25%, 50%, 75%), emphasizing swing-over commitment and hip control.

- **Back Take Recognition**: Partner defends armbar by turning away, you immediately transition to back control, developing the recognition of defensive patterns.

- **Position Cycling**: Flow between regular mount, Technical Mount, S-Mount, and armbar control based on partner's defensive movements, building fluid transition skills.

- **Submission Chain Drilling**: Start in Technical Mount, attack armbar, read defense, transition to back or triangle based on opponent's reaction, creating complete attack sequences.
