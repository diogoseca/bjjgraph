## State Properties
- **State ID**: S304
- **Point Value**: 0 (Neutral standing position with significant control advantage)
- **Position Type**: Controlling
- **Risk Level**: Low
- **Energy Cost**: Medium to High
- **Time Sustainability**: Short to Medium

## State Description
Body Lock Position is a dominant standing clinch control where you wrap both arms around opponent's torso (either over-under or double underhooks), locking your hands together to create a powerful connection. This position provides exceptional control over opponent's movement and posture while setting up various takedowns, throws, and back takes. The body lock represents one of the highest levels of standing control in both wrestling and BJJ.

### Visual Description
You are standing in close proximity to opponent with both arms wrapped around their torso, hands locked together behind their back (typically using a gable grip or rear naked choke grip). Your chest is pressed against theirs with your head positioned to the side (typically on the underhook side if using over-under grip). Your hips are engaged and driving forward, controlling their center of mass and breaking their posture backward. Your legs maintain a wide, stable stance with knees bent, weight distributed to allow explosive movement while resisting their attempts to create space or counter. The position creates a vice-like control that severely limits opponent's options.

## Key Principles
- Double underhooks or over-under grip provides overwhelming control
- Chest-to-chest contact eliminates space and increases control
- Hip pressure and forward drive breaks opponent's posture
- Head position on underhook side enhances control and throwing power
- Body lock is transitional - must attack immediately or opponent escapes
- Control opponent's hips and center of mass to dictate direction

## Offensive Transitions

From this position, you can execute:

### Takedowns and Throws
- [[Mat Return]] → [[Back Control]] (Success Rate: Beginner 60%, Intermediate 75%, Advanced 90%)
  - Drive forward and trip opponent backward, securing back control as they fall

- [[Body Lock Takedown]] → [[Side Control]] (Success Rate: Beginner 55%, Intermediate 70%, Advanced 85%)
  - Lift and drive opponent to mat using body lock control

- [[Hip Toss]] → [[Side Control]] (Success Rate: Beginner 45%, Intermediate 60%, Advanced 75%)
  - Use body lock to execute hip throw variations

### Back Takes
- [[Body Lock to Back]] → [[Back Control]] (Success Rate: Beginner 50%, Intermediate 65%, Advanced 80%)
  - Transition from body lock to back take by getting behind opponent

- [[Duck Under to Back]] → [[Back Control]] (Success Rate: Beginner 45%, Intermediate 60%, Advanced 75%)
  - From body lock, duck under arm to access back

### Ground Transitions
- [[Sitting Guard Pull with Body Lock]] → [[Closed Guard Bottom]] (Success Rate: Beginner 75%, Intermediate 90%, Advanced 95%)
  - Sit to guard while maintaining body lock control

- [[Double Leg from Body Lock]] → [[Top Position]] (Success Rate: Beginner 50%, Intermediate 65%, Advanced 80%)
  - Transition body lock to double leg takedown

## Defensive Responses

When opponent has body lock control against you:

- [[Create Space with Frames]] → [[Reset Clinch]] (Success Rate: 40%)
  - Use forearms and elbows to create frames and break body lock grip

- [[Overhook and Spin]] → [[Counter Control]] (Success Rate: 35%)
  - Establish overhook on one arm, spin to escape body lock

- [[Drop Hips and Widen Base]] → [[Defensive Stance]] (Success Rate: 45%)
  - Drop weight and widen stance to resist takedown attempts

- [[Foot Stomp and Circle]] → [[Escape]] (Success Rate: 30%)
  - Stomp opponent's foot, circle away to break control

## Decision Tree

**If** you have double underhooks (both arms under opponent's arms):
- Execute [[Mat Return]] → [[Back Control]] (Probability: 90%)
  - Reasoning: Double underhooks provide overwhelming advantage, easy back take
- Or [[Body Lock Takedown]] → [[Side Control]] (Probability: 85%)
  - Reasoning: Direct takedown from dominant body lock position

**Else if** you have over-under body lock (one arm over, one under):
- Execute [[Body Lock to Back]] → [[Back Control]] (Probability: 80%)
  - Reasoning: Over-under provides angle for back take
- Or [[Hip Toss]] → [[Side Control]] (Probability: 75%)
  - Reasoning: Over-under grip facilitates throwing techniques

**Else if** opponent is resisting strongly with good base:
- Execute [[Duck Under to Back]] → [[Back Control]] (Probability: 60%)
  - Reasoning: Duck under exploits opponent's defensive posture
- Or [[Sitting Guard Pull with Body Lock]] → [[Closed Guard Bottom]] (Probability: 90%)
  - Reasoning: Maintain control while transitioning to ground game

**Else** (opponent attempting to escape):
- [[Maintain Pressure]] and [[Re-establish Position]] (Probability: 55%)
  - Reasoning: Constant pressure prevents escape, allows reset

## Expert Insights

**John Danaher**: "The body lock is the ultimate expression of torso control in standing position. When you achieve a proper body lock, particularly double underhooks, you've essentially won the standing exchange - opponent has very limited defensive options. The key is understanding that the body lock isn't a resting position; it's a launching platform for immediate attacks. From body lock, you can execute mat returns, back takes, or throws with minimal risk. The position teaches fundamental principles of center of mass control that apply throughout all of grappling."

**Gordon Ryan**: "In competition, getting the body lock is my primary goal in any standing exchange. Once I have it, especially double underhooks, the match usually goes to the ground on my terms very quickly. I focus on driving forward immediately - making opponent feel the pressure and weight, breaking their posture backward. From there, I can mat return for back control or execute throws if they resist. The body lock eliminates the uncertainty of standup exchanges and gives me complete control over when and how we go to the ground."

**Eddie Bravo**: "The body lock connects beautifully with our submission game. From body lock control, you can mat return for back takes which flow directly into our back attack system. Or if opponent defends the mat return, you can sit to guard with body lock control already established, immediately working toward rubber guard or other positions. The 10th Planet philosophy is to always be threatening something - body lock isn't just about takedowns, it's about creating submission opportunities whether standing or on the ground."

## Common Errors

### Error: Insufficient hip pressure and forward drive
- **Consequence**: Allows opponent to maintain posture and defend effectively, reducing control advantage
- **Correction**: Drive hips forward constantly, forcing opponent's weight backward and breaking their posture
- **Recognition**: If opponent maintains upright posture despite body lock, increase hip pressure

### Error: Releasing body lock grip too early
- **Consequence**: Loses dominant control position before securing next position or technique
- **Correction**: Maintain locked hands throughout entire technique execution until new control established
- **Recognition**: If opponent escapes frequently during your techniques, check grip maintenance

### Error: Poor head positioning (head away from underhook side)
- **Consequence**: Reduces throwing power and allows opponent better defensive positioning
- **Correction**: Keep head on same side as your underhook (in over-under) or inside (in double underhooks)
- **Recognition**: If throws feel weak or opponent controls your head, adjust head position

### Error: Remaining static in body lock without attacking
- **Consequence**: Allows opponent time to establish counter-controls or break your grip
- **Correction**: Attack immediately after securing body lock - mat return, throw, or back take
- **Recognition**: If matches stall in body lock position frequently, improve attack initiation

### Error: Crossing feet or poor base during body lock
- **Consequence**: Makes you vulnerable to trips and sweeps despite having upper body control
- **Correction**: Maintain wide stance with knees bent, never cross feet, constantly adjust base
- **Recognition**: If you get taken down while holding body lock, your base needs work

## Training Drills

### Drill 1: Body Lock Establishment and Maintenance
From neutral standing clinch, race to establish body lock against resisting partner (50-75% resistance). First person to lock hands wins. Practice both double underhooks and over-under variations. Partner attempts common defenses (frames, overhooks, circling) while you maintain control. 2-minute rounds, 5-7 rounds alternating roles. Success metric: establish body lock first in 60%+ of rounds.

### Drill 2: Body Lock to Technique Chain
Start with body lock established, flow between techniques: mat return, body lock throw, duck under to back, guard pull with body lock. Partner provides specific reactions (resist, widen base, attempt escape) to create realistic scenarios. Practice reading reactions and selecting appropriate technique. 5 minutes per round. Success metric: smooth technique execution with successful completion 70%+ of attempts.

### Drill 3: Body Lock Defense and Escape
Partner establishes body lock, you practice defensive responses: create frames, overhook and spin, drop hips and widen base, foot stomp and circle. Start at 50% resistance, progress to 100% as skill improves. Focus on timing and proper mechanics for each defense. 2-minute rounds, 5-7 rounds alternating roles. Success metric: successfully defend or escape body lock 60%+ of attempts.

## Optimal Submission Paths

**Fastest path to back control** (mat return route):
[[Body Lock Position]] → [[Mat Return]] → [[Back Control]] → [[Rear Naked Choke]] → [[Won by Submission]]
*Reasoning: Direct path from body lock dominance to back control and submission*

**High-percentage path** (systematic back take):
[[Body Lock Position]] → [[Body Lock to Back]] → [[Back Control]] → [[Rear Naked Choke]] → [[Won by Submission]]
*Reasoning: Systematic back take progression from body lock control*

**Throw-based path** (takedown to dominance):
[[Body Lock Position]] → [[Hip Toss]] → [[Side Control]] → [[Mount]] → [[Submission Attack]] → [[Won by Submission]]
*Reasoning: Use throwing technique to establish top position for submission*

**Guard pull path** (ground transition):
[[Body Lock Position]] → [[Sitting Guard Pull with Body Lock]] → [[Closed Guard Bottom]] → [[Triangle Choke]] → [[Won by Submission]]
*Reasoning: Maintain body lock control while transitioning to guard-based attacks*
