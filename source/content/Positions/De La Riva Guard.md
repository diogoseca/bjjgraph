## State Properties

- **Point Value**: 0 (Neutral with offensive options)
- **Position Type**: Offensive guard position
- **Risk Level**: Medium to High
- **Energy Cost**: Medium to High
- **Time Sustainability**: Medium

## State Description
De La Riva Guard (DLR) is a sophisticated open guard variation where the bottom player hooks the opponent's lead leg with their outside foot while controlling the ankle or pant with their hand on the same side. The other hand typically controls the opponent's sleeve or collar, creating a structure that limits the opponent's mobility and generates powerful sweeping leverage. This guard has become fundamental in modern BJJ, particularly for setting up berimbolo sequences, back takes, and creating connections to other guard systems.

## Key Principles
- Control opponent's lead leg with both foot hook and hand grip
- Maintain grip on sleeve/collar to limit opponent's upper body mobility
- Create and manipulate angles to off-balance opponent
- Keep active hip movement to prevent passing
- Connect upper and lower body controls for complete control
- Maintain proper distance to prevent opponent from smashing or pressuring

## Prerequisites
- Hip mobility and leg dexterity
- Understanding of off-balancing mechanics
- Basic grip fighting fundamentals
- Adequate hamstring flexibility

## State Invariants
- Outside foot hooking opponent's lead leg
- Same-side hand controlling ankle/pant of hooked leg
- Opposite hand controlling sleeve/collar/wrist
- Bottom player's hips active and mobile
- Off-angle relationship (not squared up) with opponent

## Defensive Responses (When Opponent Has This State)
- [[DLR Hook Removal]] → [[Toreando Pass]]
- [[Base and Posture]] → [[Leg Drag Attempt]]
- [[Heavy Forward Pressure]] → [[Smash Pass]]
- [[Backward Weight Shift]] → [[Long Step Pass]]
- [[Knee Cut Entry]] → [[Knee Cut Pass]]

## Offensive Transitions (Available From This State)
- [[DLR Basic Sweep]] → [[Top Position]]
- [[Berimbolo]] → [[Back Control]]
- [[Babybolo]] → [[Back Control]]
- [[DLR to X-Guard]] → [[X-Guard]]
- [[DLR to Single Leg X]] → [[Single Leg X Guard]]
- [[DLR to Reverse De La Riva]] → [[Reverse De La Riva Guard]]
- [[Matrix Entry]] → [[Matrix Position]]
- [[Kiss of the Dragon]] → [[Back Control]]

## Counter Transitions
- [[DLR Recovery]] → [[De La Riva Guard]] (against pass attempts)
- [[DLR to Closed Guard]] → [[Closed Guard Bottom]] (under pressure)
- [[Shin-to-Shin Fallback]] → [[Shin-to-Shin Guard]] (under pressure)

## Expert Insights
- **Danaher System**: Emphasizes the importance of maintaining tension in the DLR hook while creating off-balancing leverage. Focuses on systematic connections to leg entanglements and X-guard variations rather than traditional berimbolo sequences. Creates clear defensive hierarchies when the position is threatened.
- **Gordon Ryan**: Uses DLR primarily as a transitional position leading to leg entanglements or back exposures. Emphasizes precise angle adjustment with subtle hip movements, often creating "false retreats" that bait opponents into overcommitting to passes, setting up counters.
- **Eddie Bravo**: Incorporates DLR principles into the 10th Planet system, but with unique grip configurations that don't rely on the gi. Focuses on combining rubber guard principles with leg positioning from DLR to create hybrid positions and unconventional control patterns.

## Common Errors
- Passive hook placement → Easily disengaged by opponent
- Poor distance management → Vulnerability to pressure passing
- Overcommitment to single attack → Predictable patterns
- Losing sleeve/collar control → Compromised upper body control
- Static hip positioning → Reduced defensive capability

## Training Drills
- DLR hook placement and tension drills
- Grip fighting sequences for establishing control
- Transition flows between DLR and related guards
- Hip mobility and preventative framing exercises
- Sweep combinations with progressive resistance

- [[Butterfly Guard]] - Complementary open guard system
- [[Matrix Position]] - Advanced transitional position from DLR

## Decision Tree
If opponent stands tall with weight on back foot:
- Execute [[Berimbolo]] or [[Babybolo]]

Else if opponent drives forward with pressure:
- Execute [[DLR to X-Guard]] or [[DLR to Single Leg X]]

Else if opponent shifts weight to hooked leg:
- Execute [[DLR Basic Sweep]]

Else if opponent tries to disengage the hook:
- Execute [[Kiss of the Dragon]]

## Position Metrics
- Success Rate: 60% offensive action (competition data)
- Average Time in Position: 30-60 seconds
- Sweep Probability: 50%
- Back Take Probability: 35%
- Position Loss Probability: 35%

## Optimal Paths
Back-taking path:
[[De La Riva Guard]] → [[Berimbolo]] → [[Back Control]] → [[Rear Naked Choke]] → [[Won by Submission]]

Leg lock-oriented path:
[[De La Riva Guard]] → [[DLR to Single Leg X]] → [[Single Leg X Guard]] → [[Ashi Garami]] → [[Inside Heel Hook]] → [[Won by Submission]]

Traditional sweep path:
[[De La Riva Guard]] → [[DLR Basic Sweep]] → [[Side Control Top]] → [[Mount]] → [[Arm Triangle]] → [[Won by Submission]]

## Computer Science Analogy
De La Riva Guard functions as a versatile routing node in the BJJ state graph with multiple weighted edges to different advantageous states. Its connectivity to both conventional positional paths and modern leg lock/back attack systems makes it a strategic vertex with high decision-tree branching factor, allowing tactical flexibility based on opponent responses.
