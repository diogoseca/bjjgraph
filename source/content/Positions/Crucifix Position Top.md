# Crucifix Position Top
#bjj #state #control #submission #crucifix #top

## State Properties
- **State ID**: S079
- **Point Value**: 3 (Strong control with high submission potential)
- **Position Type**: Controlling/Submission position
- **Risk Level**: Low
- **Energy Cost**: Low
- **Time Sustainability**: Medium to Long

## State Description
The Crucifix Position Top is an exceptionally dominant control and submission position where the top player has isolated one of the opponent's arms using a leg trap while simultaneously controlling their head and neck area, creating a cross-like body configuration. This position is most commonly entered from turtle top, back control transitions, or during scrambles where the opponent gives up an arm. The crucifix offers outstanding control with minimal energy expenditure while presenting numerous high-percentage submission opportunities, particularly rear naked chokes, armlocks, and neck cranks. The perpendicular body positioning and double-limb control (arm and head) severely restrict the bottom player's defensive capabilities.

### Visual Description
You are positioned perpendicular to your opponent, forming a cross-shaped alignment with their body, with one of their arms trapped securely between your legs where one leg hooks over their shoulder or upper arm while your other leg presses against their torso or controls the arm at the elbow level, creating a complete arm immobilization. Your upper body controls their head and neck, typically with a seatbelt grip configuration where one arm wraps under their chin or around their neck while the other arm reaches over their shoulder, with your hands locked together in a strong grip. Your weight is strategically distributed across their shoulder and upper back, keeping them flattened or on their side and unable to turn into you or generate escape momentum. The opponent is typically prone or on their side on the mat, with one arm completely immobilized by your leg trap, their head controlled and pulled tight to your chest, and their body unable to generate meaningful defensive movement due to your perpendicular pressure and positional dominance.

## Key Principles
- Isolate and trap one arm completely with leg control
- Establish dominant head and neck control with seatbelt grip
- Maintain strict perpendicular body positioning
- Distribute weight to prevent opponent's movement
- Create systematic submission opportunities
- Control opponent's vision and breathing
- Minimize energy expenditure while maximizing control

## Prerequisites
- Understanding of arm isolation mechanics
- Familiarity with seatbelt grip control
- Recognition of crucifix entry opportunities from turtle
- Knowledge of perpendicular control positions

## State Invariants
- One opponent arm trapped between your legs
- Head and neck controlled with upper body grips
- Perpendicular body alignment maintained
- Opponent's mobility severely restricted
- Weight distributed across shoulder/upper back

## Expert Insights
- **John Danaher**: "The crucifix represents one of the most efficient control positions in jiu-jitsu, where energy expenditure is minimal while control and submission potential are maximal. The mechanical advantage comes from simultaneously controlling two critical points: the arm and the head. Most practitioners fail to appreciate that the crucifix is not just a submission position but an exceptional control position that can be held indefinitely with proper weight distribution. The key is establishing the leg trap first, then methodically securing head control before attacking submissions."
- **Gordon Ryan**: "I use the crucifix extensively in both gi and no-gi competition because it provides a massive advantage with very low risk of reversal. The position allows me to methodically work through submission attempts while maintaining complete control. I particularly favor the crucifix from turtle top positions and back control transitions. The critical detail is maintaining the perpendicular angle and ensuring the arm trap is completely secure before attempting submissions. When done correctly, the opponent has almost zero escape options."
- **Eddie Bravo**: "The crucifix is a cornerstone of the 10th Planet system, particularly as it connects to our truck and twister positions. I teach students to view the crucifix not as a single position but as a hub for multiple attacks including armlocks, chokes, and unique submissions like the electric chair and banana split. The beauty of the crucifix is that it can be hit from so many different positions, and once you have it, the opponent is essentially helpless. I emphasize using the leg trap aggressively to completely neutralize the arm while hunting for the neck."

## Common Errors
- **Error**: Insufficient arm control
  - **Consequence**: Allows opponent to extract trapped arm and begin escape sequence, compromising the dominant position.
  - **Correction**: Ensure legs are tightly controlling their arm with one leg over the shoulder and the other pressing against their torso, creating a secure trap.
- **Error**: Poor head control
  - **Consequence**: Permits opponent to look away and create defensive space, reducing submission effectiveness.
  - **Correction**: Maintain tight head control with seatbelt grip or arm around their neck, pulling their head towards your chest to eliminate visibility and mobility.
- **Error**: Improper weight distribution
  - **Consequence**: Weakens overall control and allows opponent to turn or bridge, creating escape opportunities.
  - **Correction**: Keep your weight centered on their shoulder or upper back, maintaining perpendicular alignment to prevent their movement.
- **Error**: Rushing submissions
  - **Consequence**: Creates openings for escape as incomplete control leads to lost position, wasting the crucifix advantage.
  - **Correction**: Establish full control first with both arm trap and head control secured before methodically working toward submission.
- **Error**: Ignoring body positioning
  - **Consequence**: Reduces control efficiency as improper angle weakens leverage and pressure, making defense easier for opponent.
  - **Correction**: Maintain perpendicular body position to opponent, ensuring your torso crosses theirs at optimal angle for control and attacks.

## Training Drills
- **Crucifix Entry from Turtle**: Practice entering crucifix from turtle top position against progressive resistance, focusing on arm isolation timing and leg trap establishment.
- **Crucifix Maintenance Under Pressure**: Hold crucifix position while opponent attempts various escapes, developing sensitivity to weight distribution and control adjustments.
- **Submission Chain Flow**: Flow between different crucifix submissions (rear naked choke, armlock, triangle) seamlessly, understanding the transitions and setups for each.
- **Crucifix from Back Control**: Drill transitioning from back control to crucifix when opponent defends chokes, capitalizing on arm exposure opportunities.
- **Dynamic Crucifix Adjustments**: Practice adjusting crucifix position dynamically as opponent moves, maintaining control through rolling, bridging, and scramble situations.

Transitional path:
[[Crucifix Position Top]] → [[Crucifix to Back Control]] → [[Back Control]] → [[Rear Naked Choke]] → [[Won by Submission]]

Triangle variation path:

## Computer Science Analogy
The Crucifix Position Top represents an optimally constrained state in the BJJ state graph, similar to a deadlock scenario in concurrent systems where the opponent has multiple resources (arm and head) locked simultaneously, with no available operations to break free without external intervention. The position functions as a constraint satisfaction problem that has been solved in the attacker's favor, with the opponent's state space reduced to near-zero viable actions. This creates a highly favorable decision tree where almost all branches lead to successful outcomes for the controlling player.
