# De La Riva Guard Top
#bjj #state #guardpassing #delariva #top

## State Properties
- **State ID**: S217
- **Point Value**: 0 (No points until pass is completed)
- **Position Type**: Passing/Offensive
- **Risk Level**: Medium
- **Energy Cost**: Medium to High
- **Time Sustainability**: Short to Medium

## State Description
De La Riva Guard Top position occurs when the top practitioner is facing an opponent playing De La Riva (DLR) guard, where the bottom player has their outside leg hooked behind the top player's near leg while controlling the pants or ankle, with their other leg typically managing distance or controlling the opposite side. The top player's goal is to neutralize the DLR hooks and leg controls, pass the guard, and establish a dominant position. This requires understanding DLR mechanics, applying appropriate pressure, and choosing the right passing strategy based on the bottom player's grips and positioning.

De La Riva guard is one of the most popular and effective open guards in modern BJJ, making DLR passing a critical skill for any serious competitor. The position presents unique challenges because the DLR hook creates off-balancing and sweeping threats while the opponent maintains distance control. Top players must balance maintaining good posture and base while simultaneously dismantling the guard structure. Modern DLR passing has evolved to include pressure-based approaches, mobile passing strategies, and combination techniques that address multiple DLR variations.

## Visual Description

The top practitioner stands or kneels with one leg forward while the bottom player's outside leg hooks behind that lead leg with their foot curling around the calf or knee. The bottom player's same-side hand typically controls the top player's pants at the ankle or grabs the belt/gi material, creating a strong connection. Their other leg may be active - butterfly hook, pushing on the hip, or controlling distance on the other side. The top player faces forward toward the bottom player's head, attempting to maintain upright posture despite the off-balancing nature of the DLR hook. The top player's hands work to strip grips, control the hooked leg, or establish dominant grips on the bottom player's legs or upper body. Weight distribution is critical - too much forward creates sweep opportunities, too much backward allows the guard player to extend and maintain. The bottom player's hips are often angled to one side, creating the fundamental DLR geometry that makes the position effective. The top player must recognize which DLR variation they're facing (classic DLR, kiss of the dragon setup, berimbolo entry) to choose appropriate passing strategy.

## Key Principles
- **Posture Maintenance**: Stay upright to prevent forward sweeps and maintain balance
- **Grip Fighting**: Strip or control the ankle/pants grip that powers DLR control
- **Hook Removal**: Neutralize the DLR hook through pressure or leg positioning
- **Hip Control**: Don't allow bottom player to maintain optimal hip angle for attacks
- **Pressure Application**: Once hooks are neutralized, apply passing pressure
- **Movement Economy**: Minimal wasted motion - DLR can punish inefficient movement

## Prerequisites
- Understanding of DLR guard mechanics and sweep threats
- Good base and balance to resist off-balancing
- Grip fighting skills
- Multiple passing strategies for different DLR variations

## State Invariants
- Bottom player has DLR hook active behind top player's leg
- Bottom player maintains distance control through legs or grips
- Top player is standing or in combat base
- Top player working to neutralize guard and pass
- Position is dynamic with constant adjustments

## Expert Insights
- **John Danaher**: "De La Riva passing requires understanding the mechanical structure that makes the guard dangerous. The DLR hook creates off-balancing, but only if the bottom player maintains proper hip angle and grip connections. Your first priority is breaking those connections - strip the ankle grip, control the hooked leg, and flatten their hips. Once the structure is broken, the pass becomes straightforward. Never try to pass intact DLR - dismantle it first."

- **Gordon Ryan**: "I pass DLR by immediately attacking the hook leg. I grab that shin and either backstep to take the back, or smash it across their body for a leg drag. The key is being explosive and committed - tentative DLR passing gets you swept. I also like creating distance first, letting them extend, then diving in with the pass when their structure is stretched. DLR is dangerous at mid-range but weak at both close and far distances."

- **Eddie Bravo**: "DLR can be a nightmare if you don't know what you're doing. In 10th Planet, we drill specific DLR counters because so many competitors use it. The main thing is don't let them establish their rhythm. Pressure their non-hooked leg, strip grips aggressively, and don't give them time to set up berimbolo or sweep entries. If they do get you off-balance, be ready to sprawl or base out immediately. DLR rewards patience from the bottom but punishes hesitation from the top."

## Common Errors

### Error: Poor posture allowing forward sweeps
- **Consequence**: DLR guard's primary threat is off-balancing you forward using the hook and grip combination. Poor posture makes these sweeps high-percentage, resulting in you being swept and guard player achieving top position or back take.
- **Correction**: Maintain upright posture with chest up and hips back. Your head should be over or slightly behind your hips, not leaning forward. Think about sitting back into their guard rather than leaning over them. Strong core engagement prevents being pulled forward.
- **Recognition**: If you're getting swept forward frequently from DLR, your posture is compromised.

### Error: Allowing bottom player to maintain optimal hip angle
- **Consequence**: DLR guard is most effective when bottom player's hips are angled perpendicular to you. This angle creates maximum sweep leverage and berimbolo entry opportunities. Allowing them to maintain it makes passing extremely difficult.
- **Correction**: Flatten their hips by pressuring their non-hooked leg toward the mat, or control their hips directly with hand grips. Force them to face you more squarely, which nullifies much of DLR's sweeping power. Their hips should be flat or at least not perfectly angled.
- **Recognition**: If bottom player feels incredibly strong and mobile in their DLR, they have optimal hip positioning.

### Error: Failing to address the ankle/pants grip
- **Consequence**: The grip on your ankle or pants is what makes the DLR hook effective - it prevents you from backing out and creates the connection for sweeps. Ignoring this grip allows all DLR attacks to remain available.
- **Correction**: Immediately strip or control the ankle grip as a priority. Use two hands if necessary, or establish your own dominant grips that prevent their control. Once grip is broken, maintain distance or pressure to prevent re-establishment.
- **Recognition**: If you can't move your hooked leg freely and feel stuck in DLR, the grip is controlling you.

### Error: Staying in the dangerous mid-range distance
- **Consequence**: DLR is most dangerous at mid-range where the guard player has leverage but you don't have passing pressure. This range allows all their attacks while giving you few offensive options. It's the worst distance to remain in.
- **Correction**: Commit to either getting very close (smash passing, pressure passing) or creating distance (backing out to reset or explosive diving entry). Don't linger in the middle. Make a decisive choice and execute it fully.
- **Recognition**: If you feel stuck unable to pass but also unable to disengage, you're in mid-range limbo.

### Error: Predictable passing direction
- **Consequence**: If you always pass to the same side or use the same passing technique, experienced DLR players will read this and set up specific counters. Your predictability becomes their advantage.
- **Correction**: Develop multiple passing strategies from DLR - backstep, leg drag, smash pass, knee cut. Mix up which side you pass to. Use feints to disguise your true intention. Keep them guessing about your approach.
- **Recognition**: If the same DLR player keeps catching you with the same sweep or transition, you've become predictable.

## Training Drills

### Drill 1: DLR Posture and Base Maintenance
Partner establishes DLR guard with full controls. Top person focuses solely on maintaining perfect posture and base against sweep attempts. Partner performs various DLR sweeps at progressive resistance (50%, 70%, 90%). Top person doesn't attempt to pass, only maintains structure. 3-minute rounds. Focus: Finding optimal weight distribution, using grip fighting to maintain posture, recognizing when balance is threatened, basing out correctly when off-balanced.

### Drill 2: DLR Hook Removal Techniques
Start with DLR guard established. Top person practices various hook removal methods: grip stripping, leg control, stepping back, pressure techniques. Once hook is removed, reset in DLR. Partner provides moderate resistance (60%). 5-minute rounds. Focus: Efficient hook removal mechanics, grip fighting sequences, choosing appropriate removal method based on grips and positioning, preventing immediate re-hooking.

### Drill 3: DLR Pass Repetitions
Establish DLR guard. Top person executes specific passing technique (backstep, leg drag, smash pass, or knee cut) to completion. Start at 40% resistance, build to 75%. Complete the pass to side control or designated position, then reset in DLR. Alternate passing techniques each repetition. 5-minute rounds. Focus: Clean technical execution, timing the pass entry, maintaining balance during pass, completing the pass fully before resetting.

### Drill 4: DLR Positional Sparring
Start with DLR guard established. Bottom person attempts sweeps and transitions. Top person attempts to pass guard. If sweep is successful, reset in DLR. If pass is successful, reset in DLR. Live resistance (85-90%). 5-minute rounds. Focus: For top - reading DLR attacks, choosing appropriate passing strategy, staying safe while passing. For bottom - timing sweeps, creating difficult passing situations, maintaining optimal positioning.

### Drill 5: DLR Distance Management
Partner establishes DLR. Top person practices transitioning between distances: starting mid-range, exploding close for smash pass, resetting to mid-range, creating distance to reset, diving back in for different pass. Partner responds realistically (70%). 4-minute rounds. Focus: Decisiveness in distance choices, smooth distance transitions, not lingering in mid-range, timing entries when structure is stretched.

## Optimal Submission Paths
Note: DLR Top focuses on passing - paths show progression to submission after pass

**Fastest passing path**:
[[De La Riva Guard Top]] → [[Backstep Pass]] → [[Back Control]] → [[Rear Naked Choke]] → [[Won by Submission]]
*Reasoning: Backstep directly to back is fastest path when DLR structure is extended. Back offers best submission percentage.*

**Most reliable passing path**:
[[De La Riva Guard Top]] → [[Leg Drag from DLR]] → [[Side Control Top]] → [[Americana]] → [[Won by Submission]]
*Reasoning: Leg drag is high-percentage pass from DLR. Side control allows systematic submission attacks.*

**Pressure-based path**:
[[De La Riva Guard Top]] → [[Smash Pass]] → [[Side Control Top]] → [[Kimura]] → [[Won by Submission]]
*Reasoning: Smashing the guard allows pressure passing to side control. Secure position before submission attempts.*

**Distance management path**:
[[De La Riva Guard Top]] → [[Create Distance]] → [[Dive Pass]] → [[Mount]] → [[Cross Collar Choke]] → [[Won by Submission]]
*Reasoning: Creating distance stretches DLR structure, allowing explosive diving pass to mount.*

## Decision Tree

**If** bottom player has strong grips and hooks with perfect angle:
- Execute [[Strip Grips and Disengage]] → [[Reset]] (Probability: 65%)
  - Reasoning: Don't try to pass fully established strong DLR - break it down first
- Or Execute [[Backstep Pass]] → [[Back Control]] (Probability: 55%)
  - Reasoning: If committed and explosive, backstep can work even against strong DLR

**Else if** bottom player has weak grip or extended position:
- Execute [[Leg Drag from DLR]] → [[Side Control Top]] (Probability: 70%)
  - Reasoning: Weakness in structure allows direct passing, leg drag is high-percentage
- Or Execute [[Smash Pass]] → [[Side Control Top]] (Probability: 65%)
  - Reasoning: Extended position vulnerable to pressure-based passing

**Else if** bottom player is inverting or starting berimbolo:
- Execute [[Sprawl and Pressure]] → [[Top Control]] (Probability: 75%)
  - Reasoning: Inversion exposes them to being flattened, pressure nullifies berimbolo
- Or Execute [[Follow to Truck]] → [[Truck Position Top]] (Probability: 60%)
  - Reasoning: Advanced option - follow their inversion to truck position

**Else if** bottom player transitions to X-Guard or other guard:
- Execute [[Adapt Passing]] → [[Different Guard Pass]] (Probability: 70%)
  - Reasoning: Recognize new guard structure and apply appropriate passing
- Or Execute [[Reset Standing]] → [[Standing Guard Pass]] (Probability: 65%)
  - Reasoning: Sometimes resetting to standing is best tactical choice

**Else** (mid-range stalemate):
- Execute [[Knee Cut from DLR]] → [[Half Guard Top]] (Probability: 60%)
  - Reasoning: Knee cut addresses many DLR configurations reliably
- Or Execute [[Create Distance and Re-engage]] → [[Explosive Pass]] (Probability: 62%)
  - Reasoning: Break the stalemate by changing distance dramatically
