## State Properties

- **Point Value**: 0 (Neutral with strong offensive advantage)
- **Position Type**: Specialized offensive guard
- **Risk Level**: Medium
- **Energy Cost**: Medium to High
- **Time Sustainability**: Medium to Long

## State Description
Worm Guard is a specialized modern guard system developed by Keenan Cornelius that uses the opponent's lapel as the primary control mechanism. The position is characterized by threading the opponent's lapel around the player's leg while establishing specific grips and hooks that severely limit the opponent's mobility. This creates a powerful control position that offers exceptional sweeping opportunities and transitions to other advantageous positions. Worm Guard represents the evolution of lapel-based guards in modern gi jiu-jitsu, creating defensive security through innovative grip configurations.

## Key Principles
- Thread opponent's lapel around your leg to create the "worm"
- Establish secure lapel grip with same-side hand
- Control opponent's sleeve/wrist with opposite hand
- Position De La Riva hook on opponent's lead leg
- Create and maintain angle relative to opponent
- Use lapel tension to restrict opponent's movement
- Manage distance through strategic hook and grip adjustments

## Prerequisites
- Advanced grip fighting skills
- Familiarity with lapel control mechanics
- Understanding of De La Riva guard principles
- Hip mobility and dexterity
- Patience for grip establishment

## State Invariants
- Opponent's lapel wrapped around your leg
- Secure grip on threaded lapel
- Control of opponent's opposite sleeve
- De La Riva hook on opponent's lead leg
- Angled body position relative to opponent

## Defensive Responses (When Opponent Has This State)
- [[Grip Break Sequence]] → [[Passing Opportunity]]
- [[Knee Cut Counter]] → [[Knee Cut Position]]
- [[Backstep Attempt]] → [[Leg Drag Position]]
- [[Stack and Pressure]] → [[Stack Pass Attempt]]
- [[Standing Posture and Control]] → [[Toreando Position]]

## Offensive Transitions (Available From This State)
- [[Worm Guard Sweep]] → [[Top Position]]
- [[Berimbolo Entry]] → [[Berimbolo]]
- [[Back Take from Worm]] → [[Back Control]]
- [[Worm to Single Leg X]] → [[Single Leg X Guard]]
- [[Modified X Entry]] → [[X-Guard]]
- [[De La Riva Transition]] → [[De La Riva Guard]]
- [[Reverse De La Riva Switch]] → [[Reverse De La Riva Guard]]
- [[Omoplata from Worm]] → [[Omoplata Control]]

## Counter Transitions
- [[Re-establish Worm]] → [[Worm Guard]] (against grip breaks)
- [[Switch to Squid Guard]] → [[Squid Guard]] (if lapel control changes)
- [[Transition to Spider]] → [[Spider Guard]] (if distance increases)

## Expert Insights
- **Danaher System**: While not specifically focusing on Worm Guard in his teaching, acknowledges the mechanical principles that make it effective - particularly the combination of lapel control to limit hip mobility with leg positioning to prevent movement. Emphasizes understanding the defensive hierarchy when caught in Worm Guard rather than specialized offensive development of the position.
- **Gordon Ryan**: Has adapted certain principles of Worm Guard to no-gi contexts, focusing on the mechanical control aspects rather than the specific lapel configurations. Recognizes the position's effectiveness for competition but focuses more on universally applicable guards in his own game.
- **Eddie Bravo**: Has not explicitly incorporated Worm Guard into the 10th Planet system due to its gi-specific nature, but has developed parallel control structures in no-gi that achieve similar control objectives through different mechanical means.

## Common Errors
- Insufficient lapel tension → Reduced control effectiveness
- Poor lapel threading depth → Easy for opponent to extract
- Flat positioning → Vulnerability to pressure passing
- Overcommitment to lapel grip → Neglecting defensive awareness
- Passive De La Riva hook → Ineffective leg control

## Training Drills
- Worm Guard entry and grip sequencing
- Maintenance against progressive passing pressure
- Transition flows between Worm and related guards
- Sweep combinations with resistance
- Recovery sequences from compromised positions

## Decision Tree
If opponent stands tall with weight back:
- Execute [[Worm Guard Sweep]] or [[Berimbolo Entry]]

Else if opponent tries to knee cut:
- Execute [[Back Take from Worm]] or [[Worm to Single Leg X]]

Else if opponent attempts to grip break:
- Execute [[Switch to Squid Guard]] or [[De La Riva Transition]]

Else if opponent pressures forward:
- Execute [[Omoplata from Worm]] or [[Modified X Entry]]

## Position Metrics
- Success Rate: 75% offensive action (competition data)
- Average Time in Position: 30-90 seconds
- Sweep Probability: 65%
- Back Take Probability: 40%
- Position Loss Probability: 25%

## Optimal Paths
Sweeping path:
[[Worm Guard]] → [[Worm Guard Sweep]] → [[Top Position]] → [[Side Control]] → dominant position sequence

Back-taking path:
[[Worm Guard]] → [[Berimbolo Entry]] → [[Berimbolo]] → [[Back Control]] → [[Rear Naked Choke]] → [[Won by Submission]]

Submission path:
[[Worm Guard]] → [[Omoplata from Worm]] → [[Omoplata Control]] → submission finish

## Historical Context
Worm Guard was developed and popularized by Keenan Cornelius around 2014, representing an evolution in lapel-based guards. The system emerged in response to the increasing sophistication of guard passing, creating a control structure that severely limited the passer's mobility through innovative use of the gi. Worm Guard subsequently evolved into a family of related positions (Squid Guard, Ringworm Guard, etc.) that all use the same fundamental principle of using the opponent's own gi against them to create powerful control mechanisms.

## Computer Science Analogy
Worm Guard represents a specialized constraint system in the BJJ state graph that uses the opponent's equipment (gi) against them - similar to how a computer virus might repurpose a system's own resources to restrict its function. The guard creates a "deadlock" scenario where the opponent's movement is severely constrained through circular dependencies (the lapel wrap), requiring significant resource expenditure to break free from the constraint system.
