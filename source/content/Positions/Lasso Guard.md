## State Machine Content Elements

### Visual Description
Must include detailed physical positioning that enables clear spatial understanding and visualization:

You are on your back with one leg threaded through your opponent's arm, creating a lasso-like grip by grabbing their sleeve. Your other leg typically controls their bicep or maintains distance. Your opponent is kneeling or standing with one arm trapped and controlled by the lasso configuration. The trapped arm creates a powerful control mechanism that prevents passing while exposing them to various sweeps and attacks. Your hips remain mobile to adjust angles and maintain optimal control.

**Template**: "You lie on your back with one leg lassoed through opponent's arm while gripping their sleeve. Your opponent kneels with one arm trapped and controlled. Leg creates powerful leverage for sweeps and control. Mobile hips allow angle adjustments and attack opportunities."

### Defensive Responses (Available Counter-Actions)
When opponent has this position:
- **Sleeve Break**: Breaking the lasso grip to neutralize control → [[Open Guard Top]] (Success Rate: 50%)
- **Stack Pressure**: Driving forward to compress and collapse guard → [[Guard Pass]] (Success Rate: 40%)
- **Leg Clear**: Clearing the lassoed leg to escape control → [[Open Guard Top]] (Success Rate: 45%)
- **Step Around**: Circling away from lasso side → [[Side Control]] (Success Rate: 35%)

Format: `[[Technique Name]] → [[Resulting State]] (Success Rate: X%)`

### Offensive Transitions (Available Actions)
From this position:
- **Lasso Sweep**: Using leg leverage to off-balance and sweep → [[Top Position]] (Success Rate: Beginner 35%, Intermediate 55%, Advanced 70%)
- **Omoplata Setup**: Converting lasso to omoplata shoulder lock → [[Omoplata Control]] (Success Rate: Beginner 25%, Intermediate 45%, Advanced 65%)
- **Triangle Setup**: Using lasso control to set up triangle → [[Triangle Control]] (Success Rate: Beginner 20%, Intermediate 40%, Advanced 60%)
- **Spider Transition**: Converting to spider guard configuration → [[Spider Guard]] (Success Rate: Beginner 50%, Intermediate 70%, Advanced 85%)
- **Back Take**: Using lasso control to access back position → [[Back Control]] (Success Rate: Beginner 15%, Intermediate 30%, Advanced 50%)
- **Arm Drag**: Using lasso grip for arm drag sweep → [[Top Position]] (Success Rate: Beginner 30%, Intermediate 50%, Advanced 70%)

Format: `[[Technique Name]] → [[Resulting State]] (Success Rate: Beginner X%, Intermediate Y%, Advanced Z%)`

## Decision Tree Logic
Structured decision-making logic:
```
If [opponent attempts to pass lasso side]:
- Execute [[Lasso Sweep]] → [[Top Position]] (Probability: 65%)

Else if [opponent postures high with trapped arm]:
- Execute [[Omoplata Setup]] → [[Omoplata Control]] (Probability: 55%)

Else if [opponent leans forward significantly]:
- Execute [[Triangle Setup]] → [[Triangle Control]] (Probability: 50%)

Else [opponent maintains defensive distance]:
- Execute [[Spider Transition]] → [[Spider Guard]] (Probability: 75%)
```

## Educational & Commentary Content

### Expert Insights
Commentary as if from recognized authorities for authentic technical analysis:
- **John Danaher**: "The lasso guard succeeds through systematic control of distance and angle combined with powerful leverage from the leg weave. The key is maintaining constant tension on the sleeve while using the leg to create mechanical disadvantage for the opponent. The position offers multiple high-percentage attacks when executed with proper timing and pressure."
- **Gordon Ryan**: "In competition, lasso guard is exceptional for controlling aggressive passers who try to pressure forward. I use it to set up sweeps and back takes, particularly against opponents who overcommit to guard passing. The lasso grip creates immediate attacking opportunities while maintaining defensive security."
- **Eddie Bravo**: "Lasso guard integrates beautifully with rubber guard concepts and other open guard systems. It's particularly effective when combined with lapel work and can transition seamlessly into truck positions and other advanced controls. The versatility makes it a cornerstone of modern guard play."

Each insight should be 2-3 sentences providing specific technical or strategic guidance.

### Common Errors
For technical understanding and education:
- **Error Description**: Failing to maintain constant tension on the sleeve grip
- **Consequence**: Opponent can break grip easily and neutralize lasso control
- **Correction**: Keep consistent pulling pressure on sleeve throughout position

- **Error Description**: Allowing opponent to clear the lassoed leg passively
- **Consequence**: Loses primary control mechanism and positional advantage
- **Correction**: Actively adjust leg position and maintain weave when opponent moves

- **Error Description**: Staying static without transitioning between attacks
- **Consequence**: High energy cost without offensive progress or advancement
- **Correction**: Flow between sweeps, submissions, and position changes

- **Error Description**: Inadequate hip mobility and angle adjustment
- **Consequence**: Reduces effectiveness of sweeps and submission setups
- **Correction**: Stay mobile with active hip movement to maintain optimal angles

- **Error Description**: Neglecting control of opponent's free arm
- **Consequence**: Opponent can use free arm to defend and counter-attack
- **Correction**: Monitor and control free arm with other leg or grip

### Key Principles
3-5 fundamental concepts that govern success in this position:
- Constant sleeve tension combined with leg leverage creates superior control
- Hip mobility and angle adjustment maximize sweep and submission opportunities
- Multiple attack options create overwhelming pressure on opponent's defense
- Leg weave provides mechanical advantage that's difficult to counter
- Integration with other guard systems multiplies effectiveness

### Prerequisites
Skills/positions that should be mastered before attempting this position:
- Basic open guard concepts and grip fighting fundamentals
- Hip mobility and leg flexibility for proper lasso configuration
- Understanding of sweep mechanics and leverage principles
- Sleeve grip fighting skills and grip retention abilities
- Basic submission setups from guard positions

## State Machine Integration Elements

### State Invariants
Conditions that must remain true for this position to be maintained:
- Sleeve grip must be secured with deep, strong connection
- Leg must remain threaded through opponent's arm creating lasso
- Opponent must be in kneeling or standing posture within guard range
- Tension must be maintained between sleeve grip and leg pressure

### Timing Considerations
When this position is most/least effective:
- Most effective when opponent is aggressive in guard passing attempts
- Less effective against opponents with superior grip fighting skills
- Optimal when transitioning from other open guard positions
- Vulnerable when energy levels are low due to grip fighting demands

### Training Scenarios
Practice situations for skill development:
- Grip fighting drills with progressive resistance training
- Sweep timing exercises with various opponent reactions
- Flow sequences connecting to other guard positions

### Coaching Cues
Short, memorable phrases for instruction:
- Technical reminders ("Deep sleeve grip, tight leg weave")
- Strategic guidance ("Control the arm, sweep when they move")
- Motivational elements ("Stay active, multiple threats available")
- Timing cues ("Sweep when they pass, submit when they posture")
