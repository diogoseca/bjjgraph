#bjj #state #dominant #pin #kesa_gatame #judo

## State Properties
- **State ID**: S258
- **Point Value**: 3 (Dominant position)
- **Position Type**: Offensive/Controlling
- **Risk Level**: Low
- **Energy Cost**: Low
- **Time Sustainability**: Long

## State Description

Kuzure Kesa Gatame, translated as "broken scarf hold," is a modified version of the traditional Kesa Gatame (scarf hold) position that originated in judo and has been adapted for Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu. The key distinction from standard Kesa Gatame is the underhook configuration on the opponent's far arm rather than controlling their head, creating a more submission-oriented variation while maintaining the pinning effectiveness of the parent position. This modification allows for greater mobility and transition opportunities compared to the traditional head-controlling version.

The position excels in both gi and no-gi contexts, offering strong control through hip pressure and arm isolation while providing multiple submission paths including arm locks and chokes. Kuzure Kesa Gatame is particularly valuable for practitioners who favor pressure-based pinning systems combined with upper body submission attacks. The broken scarf hold represents a strategic middle ground between the extreme immobilization of traditional kesa and the more dynamic side control variations.

## Visual Description

You sit beside your opponent with your hips positioned near their shoulder on their far side, creating a perpendicular or slightly angled orientation to their body. Your near-side arm wraps deeply under their far-side arm, establishing a strong underhook that you secure by gripping your own gi, belt, or clasping your hands together in no-gi. Your far-side arm controls their near arm, either by pinning it to the mat, controlling their wrist, or wrapping it across your body for submission setups. Your chest and shoulder apply pressure downward onto their chest and face, restricting breathing and creating discomfort. Your near-side leg typically extends away from their body for base, while your far-side leg may tuck near their hip or post for additional stability. The opponent lies on their back with their far arm trapped in your underhook, their near arm controlled or isolated, shoulders pinned to the mat, and their ability to bridge or turn severely restricted by your hip and chest pressure. This creates a sensation of being "locked down" where the opponent's upper body mobility is extremely limited while you maintain a stable platform for attacks.

## Key Principles

- **Deep Underhook Control**: Maintain deep underhook on opponent's far arm to prevent their arm from escaping and creating defensive frames
- **Hip Pressure Application**: Keep hips heavy and driving downward into opponent's shoulder and chest area
- **Chest Pressure**: Use chest and shoulder weight to restrict breathing and upper body movement
- **Arm Isolation**: Control or isolate opponent's near arm to eliminate defensive posting opportunities
- **Base Distribution**: Distribute weight between your hips (pressure) and legs (stability) for secure control
- **Submission Orientation**: Position body to facilitate arm attacks on the trapped arm while maintaining pin pressure

## Offensive Transitions

From this position, you can execute:

### Submissions
- [[Americana Setup]] → [[Americana Control]] (Success Rate: Beginner 40%, Intermediate 60%, Advanced 75%)
  - Attack the trapped far arm with americana when opponent's arm is pinned near their head
- [[Arm Triangle]] → [[Won by Submission]] (Success Rate: Beginner 35%, Intermediate 55%, Advanced 70%)
  - Transition to arm triangle when opponent turns toward you defending the underhook
- [[Kimura Setup]] → [[Kimura Control]] (Success Rate: Beginner 35%, Intermediate 55%, Advanced 70%)
  - When opponent's trapped arm creates kimura angle opportunity

### Position Improvements
- [[Mount Transition]] → [[Mount]] (Success Rate: Beginner 50%, Intermediate 65%, Advanced 80%)
  - Step over opponent's body to establish mount when they defend static submissions
- [[North-South Transition]] → [[North-South]] (Success Rate: Beginner 45%, Intermediate 60%, Advanced 75%)
  - Walk your hips over opponent's head when they attempt to escape toward you
- [[Side Control]] → [[Side Control]] (Success Rate: Beginner 60%, Intermediate 75%, Advanced 85%)
  - Transition to standard side control if kesa becomes unsustainable or to change attack angles
- [[Back Take]] → [[Back Control]] (Success Rate: Beginner 30%, Intermediate 50%, Advanced 65%)
  - When opponent turns away from pressure exposing their back

## Defensive Responses

When opponent has this position against you, available counters:

- [[Bridge and Turn]] → [[Turtle Position]] (Success Rate: 40%)
  - Explosive bridge combined with turning toward opponent's legs to escape hip pressure
- [[Elbow Escape]] → [[Half Guard Bottom]] (Success Rate: 35%)
  - Create space with near-side elbow frame and shrimp hips away to recover half guard
- [[Arm Extraction]] → [[Side Control Bottom]] (Success Rate: 30%)
  - Pull trapped arm free from underhook and return to standard side control escape options
- [[Roll Through]] → [[Guard Recovery]] (Success Rate: 25%)
  - Commit to full rolling motion over your shoulder when opponent's weight is high

## Decision Tree

**If** opponent's underhook is shallow or loose:
- Execute [[Arm Extraction]] → [[Side Control Bottom]] (Probability: 40%)
  - Reasoning: Shallow underhook allows you to pull arm free before full control established

**Else if** opponent commits heavy to chest pressure:
- Execute [[Bridge and Turn]] → [[Turtle Position]] (Probability: 40%)
  - Reasoning: Heavy chest pressure creates opportunity for explosive bridge and turn

**Else if** opponent transitions to submission:
- Execute [[Roll Through]] → [[Guard Recovery]] (Probability: 25%)
  - Reasoning: During transition their base becomes compromised, enabling roll escape

**Else** (strong underhook with balanced pressure):
- Execute [[Elbow Escape]] → [[Half Guard Bottom]] (Probability: 35%)
  - Reasoning: Patient frame creation and hip escape offers best percentage when position fully established

## Expert Insights

**John Danaher**: Kuzure Kesa Gatame represents an intelligent adaptation of traditional judo pinning to accommodate the submission-oriented nature of Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu. The underhook configuration on the far arm rather than the head creates superior arm isolation for attacks while maintaining adequate pinning pressure. The biomechanical advantage comes from how your body weight drives through your hips into their shoulder girdle, creating a pressure vector that's difficult to bridge away from. When teaching this position, I emphasize understanding why the underhook depth matters - a deep underhook not only prevents escape but also creates the proper angle for americana and kimura attacks without releasing control.

**Gordon Ryan**: In modern competition, Kuzure Kesa Gatame appears less frequently than standard side control variations, but it offers specific advantages in certain scenarios, particularly when opponents are strong at standard side control escapes. The position works well as a transition point during passing or after successful takedowns where you land in this configuration naturally. The key competitive advantage is that many practitioners lack specific drilling against this position, making their escape attempts less refined. I've found it most effective when used dynamically - establishing control briefly to attack the arm, then flowing to other positions rather than trying to hold it for extended periods.

**Eddie Bravo**: While Kuzure Kesa Gatame isn't a primary position in the 10th Planet system, it demonstrates useful control principles that connect to our approach - particularly the underhook control and hip pressure combination. The position can integrate into truck transitions when you modify the leg positioning, creating a hybrid control that borrows from both classical pinning and modern leg entanglement concepts. When I teach related positions, I emphasize staying fluid with these scarf hold variations rather than getting locked into static holds, using them as transitional controls during flowing sequences to other submission-oriented positions.

## Common Errors

### Error: Shallow Underhook Depth
- **Consequence**: Opponent easily pulls their trapped arm free, returning to standard side control dynamics and eliminating arm attack opportunities
- **Correction**: Drive underhook deep under opponent's shoulder blade, securing grip on your own gi/belt or locking hands in no-gi, ensuring their arm is fully trapped
- **Recognition**: Opponent's trapped arm moving freely or able to create frames despite your control attempt

### Error: Weight Too High on Chest
- **Consequence**: Opponent can bridge effectively under your center of gravity, creating space for escape or reversal attempts
- **Correction**: Keep hips low and heavy near opponent's shoulder, using chest pressure as supplement to hip pressure rather than primary control
- **Recognition**: Opponent successfully bridging and creating significant space despite your weight

### Error: Neglecting Near Arm Control
- **Consequence**: Opponent uses free near arm to push your head, create frames, or assist in bridge escapes
- **Correction**: Control near arm by pinning it to mat, isolating it across your body, or at minimum monitoring it to prevent defensive usage
- **Recognition**: Opponent creating effective frames or pushing your head/body with near arm during escape attempts

### Error: Posting Legs Too Close Together
- **Consequence**: Narrow base makes position unstable when opponent moves explosively, leading to position loss or scrambles
- **Correction**: Extend near-side leg away from opponent's body and post far-side leg strategically for triangulated base structure
- **Recognition**: Feeling off-balance or unstable when opponent bridges or attempts explosive movements

### Error: Turning Away From Opponent
- **Consequence**: Creates space between your chest and their body, reducing pressure effectiveness and allowing escape opportunities
- **Correction**: Keep chest and shoulder driving into opponent's upper body, maintaining constant pressure connection
- **Recognition**: Feeling like opponent has room to move or breathe despite being in kesa position

## Training Drills

### Drill 1: Underhook Depth and Retention
Partner lies on back, you practice establishing deep underhook on their far arm from various angles. Progress from 0% resistance to 75% as they attempt to pull arm free. Focus on driving underhook deep under shoulder blade and securing grip on your gi/belt. 3-minute rounds alternating sides. Success metric: maintaining underhook at 75% resistance for full round.

### Drill 2: Pressure Distribution Balance
Establish Kuzure Kesa Gatame and maintain it while partner provides graduated resistance (25%, 50%, 75%, 100%). Focus on distributing weight optimally between hip pressure (primary) and chest pressure (secondary) while keeping base stable with leg positioning. 4-minute rounds with role reversal. Success metric: partner rating pressure as "heavy and controlled" even at 100% resistance.

### Drill 3: Submission Chain Flow
From established Kuzure Kesa Gatame, flow through available submissions (americana, kimura, arm triangle) with cooperative partner. Focus on maintaining position control during transitions and recognizing optimal angles for each submission. Start slow and technical, progress to flowing based on partner's defensive reactions. 5-minute rounds alternating roles. Success metric: smooth transitions between all submissions without losing position.

### Drill 4: Position Transitions
Practice transitioning into Kuzure Kesa Gatame from various positions: side control, north-south, passing positions, and after takedowns. Partner provides progressive resistance (25-75%). Focus on timing underhook establishment with pressure application. 3-minute rounds per entry position. Success metric: successful entries from all positions within 10 seconds at 75% resistance.

### Drill 5: Escape Defense Responses
Partner establishes Kuzure Kesa Gatame on you, practice all defensive responses (bridge and turn, elbow escape, arm extraction, roll through). Progress from cooperative to resistant drilling. Focus on recognizing which escape fits each position variation. 3-minute rounds per escape type. Success metric: successfully executing all escapes within each round period.

## Related Positions

- [[Kesa Gatame]] - Traditional scarf hold parent position with head control instead of underhook
- [[Side Control]] - Standard perpendicular control position without scarf hold configuration
- [[North-South]] - Related pinning position often transitioned to from kesa
- [[Modified Scarf Hold]] - Another kesa variation with different control points
- [[Reverse Kesa Gatame]] - Scarf hold facing opposite direction

## Optimal Submission Paths

**Fastest path to submission** (direct attack):
[[Kuzure Kesa Gatame Top]] → [[Americana Setup]] → [[Americana Control]] → [[Won by Submission]]
*Reasoning: Direct arm attack on already-trapped far arm, fastest when opponent's arm is in vulnerable position*

**High-percentage path** (systematic):
[[Kuzure Kesa Gatame Top]] → [[Mount Transition]] → [[Mount]] → [[Armbar]] → [[Won by Submission]]
*Reasoning: Transitioning to mount provides better submission control and more options, higher success rate overall*

**Alternative submission path** (choke option):
[[Kuzure Kesa Gatame Top]] → [[Arm Triangle]] → [[Won by Submission]]
*Reasoning: When opponent defends arm locks by turning toward you, arm triangle becomes available*

**Kimura path** (angle-dependent):
[[Kuzure Kesa Gatame Top]] → [[Kimura Setup]] → [[Kimura Control]] → [[Won by Submission]]
*Reasoning: When trapped arm creates proper kimura angle, provides powerful submission opportunity*

## Timing Considerations

**Best Times to Enter**:
- After successful takedowns that land you perpendicular to opponent
- From side control when opponent turns toward you exposing their far arm for underhook
- During passing sequences when you control opponent's far arm
- When opponent attempts to turn away from standard side control

**Best Times to Attack**:
- When underhook is deep and opponent's trapped arm is near their head (americana angle)
- After opponent fatigues from escape attempts and stops defending arm position actively
- When opponent turns into you defending the underhook (arm triangle opportunity)
- During opponent's explosive bridge attempts when their arm angle becomes vulnerable

**Vulnerable Moments**:
- During initial underhook establishment before hip pressure fully applied
- When transitioning between submissions before securing new grips
- If posting legs move too close reducing base stability
- When opponent times bridge with your weight shift

**Fatigue Factors**:
- Maintaining hip pressure requires sustained muscular engagement
- Underhook grip strength decreases with fatigue, making arm retention harder
- Position becomes more difficult to maintain as core and hip pressure fatigues
- Opponent's explosive escape attempts become more dangerous as your fatigue increases

## Competition Considerations

**Point Scoring**: Scores 3 points as dominant side control/pinning position under IBJJF rules. Maintains point value during submission attempts as long as control is maintained. Some rulesets may award additional points for maintaining the pin for specific durations.

**Time Management**: Effective for controlling match pace and burning clock while maintaining submission threats. Can be held for extended periods once fully established with proper pressure and underhook depth, making it valuable in points-based competition.

**Rule Set Adaptations**: Works in both gi and no-gi competition with minor adaptations - gi allows for stronger underhook grips on your own gi/belt, while no-gi requires hand-locking or wrist control. Under judo rules, this is a recognized osaekomi (pinning) position. IBJJF, ADCC, and most submission-only formats all recognize this as a legitimate dominant position.

**Competition Strategy**: Use as control position against opponents who excel at standard side control escapes but lack specific kesa escape training. Particularly effective for building submission attempts after securing dominant position, as the underhook naturally sets up arm attacks.

## Historical Context

Kuzure Kesa Gatame originated in traditional judo as one of the seven official pinning techniques (osaekomi-waza) within the Kodokan gokyo system. The position was developed as a variation of the original Kesa Gatame (scarf hold), with the "kuzure" (broken or modified) designation indicating its deviation from the standard form through the underhook configuration. Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu adopted this position from its judo roots, though it receives less emphasis than in judo where pins alone can secure victory. Modern BJJ practitioners have adapted kuzure kesa to focus more on submissions than pure pinning, reflecting the sport's evolution toward submission-oriented strategies over positional control alone.
