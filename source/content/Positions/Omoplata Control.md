# Omoplata Control
#bjj #state #submission #shoulder_lock #omoplata

## State Properties
- **State ID**: S032
- **Point Value**: 2 (Advantageous submission control)
- **Position Type**: Submission control position
- **Risk Level**: Medium
- **Energy Cost**: Medium
- **Time Sustainability**: Medium

## State Description
Omoplata Control is a sophisticated submission position where the practitioner uses their legs to isolate and apply pressure to the opponent's shoulder joint. The position involves trapping the opponent's arm between the practitioner's legs while their leg applies leverage across the opponent's back, creating a shoulder lock. While primarily known as a submission, the Omoplata also serves as an excellent control position that can lead to sweeps, transitions to other submissions, or positional advancement. The position offers unique control angles that are difficult to defend while providing numerous follow-up options.

## Visual Description

You are positioned on your side with your hips angled toward your opponent, one of their arms trapped between your legs with their elbow pointing downward and their hand past your hip. Your far leg extends across their upper back and shoulder blade, applying downward pressure while your near leg clamps tightly against their trapped arm, securing it in place. Your torso is elevated, supported by your arms as you sit up perpendicular to your opponent's spine, creating a 90-degree angle between your bodies. The opponent is bent forward at the waist, their trapped shoulder pulled back and rotated upward by the pressure of your leg across their back, while their free arm typically braces on the mat attempting to prevent further rotation. Your control hand grips their far hip, pants, or belt to prevent forward rolling escapes, while your other hand may post behind you for base or reach over their back for additional control. This configuration creates severe pressure on the opponent's shoulder joint while severely limiting their mobility and escape options.

## Key Principles
- Isolate opponent's arm with leg positioning
- Control opponent's posture to prevent defensive movement
- Position hips perpendicular to opponent's shoulder line
- Create leverage by extending legs and hips
- Maintain grip controls to prevent defensive counters
- Apply pressure through coordinated hip and leg movement
- Manipulate opponent's center of gravity for sweep options

## Prerequisites
- Hip mobility and hamstring flexibility
- Understanding of shoulder lock mechanics
- Recognition of entry opportunities
- Ability to maintain position during transitions

## State Invariants
- Opponent's arm trapped between practitioner's legs
- Practitioner's leg positioned across opponent's back/shoulder
- Hip connection to opponent's shoulder
- Control of opponent's posture
- Perpendicular body positioning

## Defensive Responses (When Opponent Has This State)
- [[Forward Roll]] → [[Guard Position]]
- [[Posture and Stack]] → [[Top Position]]
- [[Back Step]] → [[Leg Entanglement]]
- [[Hip Escape]] → [[Turtle Position]]
- [[Cartwheel Escape]] → [[Standing Position]]

## Offensive Transitions (Available From This State)
- [[Omoplata Finish]] → [[Won by Submission]]
- [[Omoplata Sweep]] → [[Top Position]]
- [[Omoplata to Armbar]] → [[Armbar Control]]
- [[Omoplata to Triangle]] → [[Triangle Control]]
- [[Gogoplata Transition]] → [[Omoplata Control]]
- [[Tarikoplata Variation]] → [[Won by Submission]]
- [[Omoplata Control]] → [[Back Control]]
- [[Omoplata Control]] → [[Side Control]]

## Counter Transitions
- [[Re-establish Omoplata]] → [[Omoplata Control]] (against escapes)
- [[Switch to Triangle]] → [[Triangle Control]] (if position is compromised)
- [[Convert to Sweep]] → [[Top Position]] (if submission is defended)

## Expert Insights
- **Danaher System**: Views the Omoplata primarily as a control position that creates a branching decision tree of submission and positional options based on the opponent's defensive reactions. Emphasizes the mechanical principles of proper hip and leg alignment to maximize control before attempting to finish the submission or transition to alternative attacks.
- **Gordon Ryan**: Uses the Omoplata less frequently in his no-gi game compared to other submissions, but acknowledges its value in creating scramble opportunities and forcing predictable defensive reactions. When utilizing the position, emphasizes maintaining connection points throughout transitions to prevent escape opportunities.
- **Eddie Bravo**: Has developed specialized variations of the Omoplata within the 10th Planet system, particularly the "Gomoplata" (executed from rubber guard) and connections to his lockdown system. Emphasizes creative entries and transitions from positions not commonly associated with traditional Omoplata setups.

## Common Errors
- Insufficient hip positioning → Reduced leverage
- Poor posture control → Defensive mobility
- Insufficient grip control → Easy escape routes
- Premature submission attempts → Position compromise
- Overcommitment to finish → Missing transition opportunities

## Training Drills
- Omoplata entry and control maintenance with progressive resistance
- Transition flows between Omoplata and related submissions
- Hip mobility and leg extension exercises
- Defensive recognition and counter drills
- Grip fighting and control sequences

## Related States
- [[Triangle Control]] - Related submission control
- [[Armbar Control]] - Complementary arm submission
- [[Side Control]] - Potential transition position
- [[Back Control]] - Possible transition outcome
- [[Closed Guard Bottom]] - Common entry position

- [[Triangle Control]] - Related position
- [[Top Position]] - Related position
- [[Closed Guard Bottom]] - Related position
- [[Side Control]] - Related position

## Decision Tree
If opponent attempts to roll forward:
- Execute [[Omoplata Sweep]] → [[Top Position]]

Else if opponent postures up defensively:
- Execute [[Omoplata to Triangle]] or [[Tarikoplata Variation]]

Else if opponent defends shoulder pressure:
- Execute [[Omoplata to Armbar]] or [[Gogoplata Transition]]

Else if opponent remains stationary:
- Execute [[Omoplata Finish]] → [[Won by Submission]]

## Position Metrics
- Success Rate: 60% submission or advancement (competition data)
- Average Time in Position: 15-45 seconds
- Submission Probability: 40%
- Sweep Probability: 65%
- Position Loss Probability: 25%

## Optimal Paths
Submission path:
[[Omoplata Control]] → [[Omoplata Finish]] → [[Won by Submission]]

Sweep path:
[[Omoplata Control]] → [[Omoplata Sweep]] → [[Top Position]] → [[Side Control]] → dominant position sequence

Transition path:
[[Omoplata Control]] → [[Omoplata Control]] → [[Back Control]] → [[Rear Naked Choke]] → [[Won by Submission]]

## Historical Context
The Omoplata gained prominence in BJJ in the 1990s and early 2000s as practitioners expanded beyond the fundamental submissions like armbars and triangle chokes. While the shoulder lock itself has roots in Japanese Jiu-Jitsu and catch wrestling, its integration into the guard game of BJJ represents a technical evolution of the art. Modern competition has further refined the position, with practitioners increasingly using it as a control position and sweeping mechanism rather than solely as a submission.

## Computer Science Analogy
The Omoplata Control represents a "non-deterministic finite state automaton" in the BJJ state graph, where multiple possible state transitions exist based on both the controlling player's decisions and the opponent's reactions. This creates a complex decision space with branching pathways, each with different probabilities of success. The position exemplifies the concept of "state space exploration," where the practitioner must select optimal paths through this space based on real-time feedback and pattern recognition.
