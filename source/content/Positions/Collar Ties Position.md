## State Description
Collar Ties Position is a fundamental standing clinch position where one or both practitioners control opponent's head/neck area with hand(s) behind the head or on the back of the neck. This position provides significant control over opponent's posture and movement while setting up various takedowns, throws, and positional transitions. The collar tie is borrowed from wrestling and has become integral to BJJ standup game.

### Visual Description
You are standing upright with one or both hands positioned on the back of opponent's head or neck, with your forearm(s) extending over their shoulder(s) and your palm(s) firmly pressing on their skull or upper neck area. Your elbow(s) point downward while maintaining connection, and you use this control to break their posture forward and downward. Your free hand (if using single collar tie) typically controls their wrist, sleeve, or prepares for secondary attacks. Your stance is balanced with knees slightly bent, one leg often forward, ready to execute techniques or defend against opponent's attacks. This creates both offensive and defensive capability, allowing you to dictate head positioning while setting up throws, takedowns, or guard pulls.

## Key Principles
- Control opponent's head to control their body and posture
- Break posture forward and down using collar tie pressure
- Combine head control with other grips for maximum effectiveness
- Maintain balanced stance while applying collar tie pressure
- Use collar tie to create angles and set up techniques
- Be aware of guillotine vulnerability when posture is broken

## Offensive Transitions

From this position, you can execute:

### Takedowns
- [[Snap Down]] → [[Front Headlock]] (Success Rate: Beginner 45%, Intermediate 60%, Advanced 75%)
  - Pull head down explosively while stepping back, creating front headlock opportunity

- [[Ankle Pick]] → [[Top Position]] (Success Rate: Beginner 40%, Intermediate 55%, Advanced 70%)
  - Use collar tie to create reaction, attack exposed ankle when opponent posts

- [[Arm Drag]] → [[Back Control]] (Success Rate: Beginner 35%, Intermediate 50%, Advanced 65%)
  - From collar tie, transition to arm drag to get behind opponent

### Throws
- [[Osoto Gari]] → [[Side Control]] (Success Rate: Beginner 30%, Intermediate 45%, Advanced 60%)
  - Use collar tie to control head while executing major outer reap

- [[Knee Tap]] → [[Top Position]] (Success Rate: Beginner 35%, Intermediate 50%, Advanced 65%)
  - Pull head down with collar tie, attack near knee for takedown

### Guard Pulls
- [[Sitting Guard Pull]] → [[Open Guard Bottom]] (Success Rate: Beginner 70%, Intermediate 85%, Advanced 95%)
  - Maintain collar tie while sitting to guard

- [[Jumping Guard]] → [[Closed Guard Bottom]] (Success Rate: Beginner 30%, Intermediate 50%, Advanced 70%)
  - Use collar tie to pull opponent forward during guard jump

## Defensive Responses

When opponent has collar tie position against you:

- [[Posture Up]] → [[Break Collar Tie]] (Success Rate: 40%)
  - Drive hips forward and elevate chest to break collar tie grip

- [[Whizzer]] → [[Counter Control]] (Success Rate: 45%)
  - Overhook opponent's arm to neutralize collar tie and create counter opportunity

- [[Counter Collar Tie]] → [[Collar Ties Position]] (Success Rate: 50%)
  - Establish your own collar tie to create mutual control situation

- [[Duck Under]] → [[Back Control]] (Success Rate: 35%)
  - Duck under collar tie arm to get behind opponent

## Decision Tree

**If** opponent's posture is upright and resisting:
- Execute [[Snap Down]] → [[Front Headlock]] (Probability: 60%)
  - Reasoning: Upright posture creates opportunity for explosive snap down
- Or Execute [[Ankle Pick]] → [[Top Position]] (Probability: 55%)
  - Reasoning: Upright stance exposes ankles when weight shifts

**Else if** opponent is driving forward with pressure:
- Execute [[Osoto Gari]] → [[Side Control]] (Probability: 45%)
  - Reasoning: Forward pressure aids in throwing motion
- Or Execute [[Arm Drag]] → [[Back Control]] (Probability: 50%)
  - Reasoning: Forward movement creates angle for arm drag

**Else if** opponent attempts to disengage or back away:
- Execute [[Guard Pull]] → [[Open Guard Bottom]] (Probability: 70%)
  - Reasoning: Maintain connection while transitioning to ground game

**Else** (balanced opponent / neutral):
- Break posture and initiate [[Snap Down]] → [[Front Headlock]] (Probability: 50%)
  - Reasoning: Create opportunity through posture breaking
- Or Execute [[Knee Tap]] → [[Top Position]] (Probability: 45%)
  - Reasoning: Test defensive reactions with low-risk attack

## Expert Insights

**John Danaher**: "The collar tie is fundamentally about controlling the most important part of opponent's body - their head. Where the head goes, the body follows. A strong collar tie breaks posture, limits vision, and creates angles for attacks. The key is understanding that the collar tie isn't just about pulling down - it's about controlling direction and creating dilemmas. When you pull their head one direction, their base becomes vulnerable in the opposite direction."

**Gordon Ryan**: "In competition, I use collar ties primarily as a control position before transitioning to takedowns or guard pulls. The collar tie gives me the ability to dictate pace and positioning without committing heavily to any one technique. I can feel opponent's reactions through the head control and choose the appropriate attack. Against wrestlers, the collar tie is particularly valuable because it gives you control in their domain - the standing position."

**Eddie Bravo**: "The collar tie sets up the entire standing game for 10th Planet. From collar ties, we can hit snap downs to front headlock, which flows into guillotines, darces, and anacondas. Or we can pull guard directly into rubber guard positions where the collar tie naturally transitions to mission control or other breaking positions. The key is never releasing that head control - it's your steering wheel for the entire exchange."

## Common Errors

### Error: Pulling with arm only instead of using body weight
- **Consequence**: Weak collar tie that opponent can easily resist or break, wasting energy without achieving control
- **Correction**: Pull with entire body, using hips and core to generate force while arm simply maintains connection
- **Recognition**: If opponent easily maintains posture despite collar tie, you're relying too much on arm strength

### Error: Standing too upright or too close to opponent
- **Consequence**: Makes you vulnerable to throws and counters, reduces leverage for your own techniques
- **Correction**: Maintain slight forward lean with balanced stance, keep appropriate distance for control without being too close
- **Recognition**: If you feel off-balance or get thrown easily, adjust stance and distance

### Error: Neglecting grip fighting with free hand
- **Consequence**: Opponent can establish their own controls or counter-grips, reducing your offensive options
- **Correction**: Use free hand actively for wrist control, sleeve control, or blocking opponent's grips
- **Recognition**: If opponent establishes strong grips despite your collar tie, improve secondary grip game

### Error: Maintaining static collar tie without creating movement
- **Consequence**: Stalemate position where neither practitioner can advance, wasted energy in prolonged clinch
- **Correction**: Constantly create small movements, angles, and pressure changes to elicit reactions and create opportunities
- **Recognition**: If matches frequently stall in collar tie position, work on dynamic movement and entries

### Error: Exposing neck to guillotine when using collar tie
- **Consequence**: Opponent can counter with guillotine choke, especially when you break their posture forward
- **Correction**: Keep chin down and elbows tight, be aware of guillotine threats when using collar tie aggressively
- **Recognition**: If you get caught in guillotines frequently from collar tie, improve defensive awareness

## Training Drills

### Drill 1: Collar Tie Grip Fighting
Partner stands neutral, you work to establish and maintain collar tie against progressive resistance (0% → 100%). Focus on grip placement, posture management, and maintaining control through various defensive reactions. Partner practices common escapes (posture up, whizzer, duck under) while you maintain. 3 minutes per round, 3-5 rounds. Success metric: maintain collar tie for 80%+ of time against 75% resistance.

### Drill 2: Collar Tie to Technique Chain
Start from mutual collar tie position, flow between various techniques: snap down, ankle pick, knee tap, arm drag. Partner provides specific reactions (resist, drive forward, back away, circle) on command. Practice reading reactions and selecting appropriate technique. 5 minutes per round. Success metric: smooth transitions with appropriate technique selection based on opponent's reaction.

### Drill 3: Collar Tie Defense and Counter
Partner establishes collar tie, you practice defensive responses: posture up, whizzer, counter collar tie, duck under. Start at 50% resistance, progress to 100% as skill improves. Focus on timing and proper mechanics for each defense. 2 minute rounds, 5-7 rounds alternating roles. Success metric: successfully defend/counter collar tie 70%+ of attempts.
