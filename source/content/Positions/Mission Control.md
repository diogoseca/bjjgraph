# Mission Control
#bjj #state #guard #10thplanet #rubberguard

## State Properties
- **State ID**: S052
- **Point Value**: 1 (Slight advantage)
- **Position Type**: Specialized control guard
- **Risk Level**: Low to Medium
- **Energy Cost**: Medium to High
- **Time Sustainability**: Medium

## State Description
Mission Control is the foundational control position within Eddie Bravo's Rubber Guard system, representing the first major control point in the Rubber Guard progression. This position is characterized by the bottom player having closed guard with one leg elevated, using the same-side arm to grab their own shin to create a tight control structure around the opponent's posture. Mission Control creates exceptional upper body control through a combination of closed guard pressure and the additional shoulder/posture control from the elevated leg, effectively preventing the opponent from posturing up while setting up various submission and positional advancement pathways. The position serves as a critical hub position that branches into numerous other 10th Planet-specific control positions, particularly New York Control and Williams Guard.

## Key Principles
- Establish closed guard base before initiating elevated leg control
- Create and maintain proper shin grip with same-side hand
- Control opponent's posture through combined leg and grip pressure
- Maintain proper hip positioning to maximize control effectiveness
- Apply appropriate shoulder pressure through elevated leg
- Prevent opponent from creating defensive frames or posture
- Manage energy expenditure through efficient muscle engagement
- Create pathway to subsequent control positions through proper mechanics

## Prerequisites
- Strong closed guard foundation
- Hip flexibility for leg elevation
- Wrist and forearm strength for shin grip maintenance
- Understanding of posture control mechanics
- Knowledge of rubber guard progression system

## State Invariants
- Closed guard base with opponent inside guard
- One leg elevated across opponent's shoulder/upper back
- Same-side hand gripping own shin/ankle
- Opponent's posture controlled and compromised
- Practitioner's hips engaged and connected to opponent
- Clear pathway to related control positions

## Defensive Responses (When Opponent Has This State)
- [[Posture and Frame]] → [[guard establishment]]
- [[Two-on-One Grip Break]] → [[Grip Advantage]]
- [[Shoulder Drive Forward]] → [[Guard Opening]]
- [[Hip Elevation]] → [[Stack Pressure]]
- [[Hand Fighting]] → [[Grip Breaking]]

## Offensive Transitions (Available From This State)
- [[Mission Control to New York]] → [[New York Control]]
- [[gogoplata setup]] → [[Gogoplata Control]]
- [[Mission Control Omoplata]] → [[Omoplata Control]]
- [[Transition to Williams]] → [[Williams Guard]]
- [[mission control]] → [[Top Position]]
- [[Mission Control Triangle]] → [[Triangle Control]]
- [[Arm Control to Dead Orchard]] → [[Dead Orchard Control]]
- [[Return to Closed Guard]] → [[Closed Guard Bottom]]

## Counter Transitions
- [[Re-establish Mission Control]] → [[Mission Control]] (against posture attempts)
- [[Switch to Closed Guard]] → [[Closed Guard Bottom]] (if control is compromised)
- [[Alternative Rubber Guard Entry]] → [[Rubber Guard]] (under pressure)

## Expert Insights
- **Eddie Bravo**: As the creator of Mission Control and the Rubber Guard system, considers this position the foundational control point that enables the entire Rubber Guard pathway. Emphasizes precise technical details like hip movement, shin grip position, and shoulder pressure that maximize control while minimizing energy expenditure. Has developed a systematic progression from Mission Control to more advanced positions like New York and Williams Guard, each with their own branching submission and control options.
- **Danaher System**: While not a position emphasized in the Danaher system, acknowledges its effectiveness for practitioners with appropriate flexibility. When analyzing the position, focuses on understanding the mechanical principles that make it effective, particularly how it limits the opponent's upper body mobility and posture, viewing it as a specialized closed guard variant.
- **Gordon Ryan**: Rarely employs the position in his own game but recognizes its effectiveness in specialized contexts. When addressing defenses against the position, emphasizes preventative measures that target the initial establishment phase, focusing on maintaining posture before the control is fully secured.

## Common Errors
- Insufficient leg elevation → Reduced control effectiveness
- Poor shin grip placement → Control vulnerability
- Inadequate closed guard base → Position instability
- Overreliance on arm strength → Premature fatigue
- Neglecting hip engagement → Reduced pressure
- Improper angle of pressure → Technical inefficiency

## Training Drills
- Mission Control entry and control maintenance against progressive resistance
- Transition flows between Mission Control and related positions
- Grip endurance development for shin control
- Flexibility development for optimal leg positioning
- Entry variations from different guard configurations

## Related States
- [[Rubber Guard]] - General position category
- [[New York Control]] - Next position in progression
- [[Williams Guard]] - Advanced position in progression
- [[Closed Guard Bottom]] - Foundation position
- [[Gogoplata Control]] - Related submission position


## Related Positions

- [[Williams Guard]] - Related position
- [[New York Control]] - Related position
- [[Rubber Guard]] - Related position
- [[Gogoplata Control]] - Related position
- [[Closed Guard Bottom]] - Related position

## Decision Tree
If opponent postures strongly:
- Execute [[Mission Control to New York]] or [[Mission Control Triangle]]

Else if opponent drives forward with pressure:
- Execute [[gogoplata setup]] or [[Mission Control Omoplata]]

Else if opponent attempts hand fighting:
- Execute [[Transition to Williams]] or [[Arm Control to Dead Orchard]]

Else if position is compromised:
- Execute [[Return to Closed Guard]] or [[mission control]]

## Position Metrics
- Success Rate: 70% control effectiveness (practitioner data)
- Average Time in Position: 30-60 seconds
- Transition Probability: 65%
- Submission Setup Probability: 45%
- Position Loss Probability: 25%

## Optimal Paths
Gogoplata path:
[[Mission Control]] → [[Mission Control to New York]] → [[New York Control]] → [[gogoplata setup]] → [[Gogoplata Control]] → [[Won by Submission]]

Williams Guard path:
[[Mission Control]] → [[Transition to Williams]] → [[Williams Guard]] → [[Williams Shoulder Lock]] → [[Won by Submission]]

Omoplata path:
[[Mission Control]] → [[Mission Control Omoplata]] → [[Omoplata Control]] → [[Won by Submission]]

## Historical Context
Mission Control was developed by Eddie Bravo in the early 2000s as part of his innovative 10th Planet Jiu-Jitsu system. The position emerged from Bravo's experimentation with closed guard variations that could effectively control opponent's posture without relying on gi grips, making it particularly suited for no-gi grappling and MMA applications. The position gained prominence when Bravo used related techniques against Royler Gracie in their famous match, and has since become a cornerstone of the 10th Planet system, with practitioners like Geo Martinez and Richie Martinez demonstrating its effectiveness at high levels of competition.

## Computer Science Analogy
Mission Control functions as a "state constraint manager" in the BJJ state machine, where it systematically restricts the opponent's available action space through synchronized control mechanisms. This creates a form of "parallel processing lock" where multiple control points (closed guard, elevated leg, shin grip) simultaneously restrict movement options. The position exemplifies a "finite state automaton" with well-defined transition pathways to subsequent states (New York, Williams Guard), creating a deterministic progression system with branching pathways based on opponent reactions and practitioner intent.
