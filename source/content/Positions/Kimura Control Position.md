# Kimura Control Position
#bjj #state #submission-control #shoulder-lock #kimura

## State Properties
- **State ID**: S101
- **Point Value**: 0 (Submission threat position, no positional points)
- **Position Type**: Offensive/Controlling/Submission-Oriented
- **Risk Level**: Medium
- **Energy Cost**: Medium to High
- **Time Sustainability**: Short to Medium

## State Description
Kimura Control Position is a specialized submission control state where the practitioner has established a figure-four grip (kimura grip) on one of the opponent's arms, creating immediate submission threats through shoulder rotation while simultaneously providing positional control and advancement opportunities. This position can be established from numerous scenarios including guard, top positions, scrambles, and defensive situations, making it one of BJJ's most versatile attacking configurations. The kimura grip functions as both a finishing mechanism for shoulder lock submission and a powerful control tool for sweeps, position advancement, and back takes.

The position's strategic value derives from creating multiple simultaneous threats that force opponents into defensive dilemmas where protecting against one attack opens vulnerabilities to others. Whether used as a primary submission attempt, a positional control tool, or a transitional mechanism, kimura control represents a high-level attacking framework that bridges positional grappling with submission-oriented strategy.

## Visual Description

From the attacking practitioner's perspective, you have secured a figure-four grip on opponent's arm where your same-side hand controls their wrist while your opposite hand reaches over and grabs your own wrist, creating a locked configuration. Your body positioning varies based on specific kimura variation—from guard you may have their arm trapped between your bodies with your hips creating isolation pressure, from top positions your chest weight may be driving down while your grips create rotational leverage, from scrambles you maintain the grip while maneuvering for optimal finishing angle. The opponent's captured arm is bent at approximately 90 degrees with their elbow forming the fulcrum point around which shoulder rotation occurs. Your grip placement on their wrist provides control of arm extension and rotation while your completing grip on your own wrist locks the configuration preventing escape through grip breaking. The spatial relationship creates leverage advantage where small movements of your body create significant rotational pressure on opponent's shoulder joint. This creates visible shoulder stress when pressure is applied, with opponent typically showing defensive responses including rolling toward the trapped arm, gripping their own gi or body, or attempting to frame and create space between your bodies.

## Key Principles
- Maintain figure-four grip security throughout all transitions and submission attempts
- Control opponent's elbow position as the fulcrum for all shoulder pressure applications
- Create angle and distance optimization between your body and their shoulder for maximum leverage
- Use grip not only for submission but as positional control preventing opponent's movement and escapes
- Apply rotational pressure gradually and progressively rather than explosive jerking movements
- Coordinate grip control with body positioning to create multiple simultaneous attacking threats
- Recognize and adapt to opponent's defensive responses with appropriate technical variations

## Prerequisites
- Access to opponent's arm in vulnerable position
- Ability to establish initial wrist control
- Body positioning allowing figure-four grip completion
- Understanding of shoulder rotation mechanics and leverage principles

## State Invariants
- Figure-four grip established on opponent's arm with secure hand positioning
- Opponent's arm bent at elbow creating leverage fulcrum
- Attacking practitioner's body positioned to generate rotational pressure
- Opponent showing defensive awareness or attempting to protect shoulder

- [[Rolling Kimura]] → [[Won by Submission]] (Success Rate: Beginner 25%, Intermediate 40%, Advanced 55%)
- [[Armbar from Kimura]] → [[Armbar Control]] (Success Rate: Beginner 35%, Intermediate 50%, Advanced 65%)

### Position Improvements
- [[Kimura to Back Take]] → [[Back Control]] (Success Rate: Beginner 40%, Intermediate 55%, Advanced 70%)
- [[Kimura to Mount]] → [[Mount]] (Success Rate: Beginner 45%, Intermediate 60%, Advanced 75%)
- [[Kimura to Side Control]] → [[Side Control]] (Success Rate: Beginner 50%, Intermediate 65%, Advanced 80%)

### Sweeps (from Guard)
- [[Kimura Sweep]] → [[Top Position]] (Success Rate: Beginner 40%, Intermediate 55%, Advanced 70%)
- [[Kimura to Technical Standup]] → [[Standing Position]] (Success Rate: Beginner 35%, Intermediate 50%, Advanced 65%)

## Counter Transitions
- [[Re-attack Kimura]] → [[Kimura Control Position]] (against escape attempts)
- [[Kimura to Alternative Submission]] → [[Triangle Control]] or [[Armbar Control]] (if kimura defended)
- [[Positional Advancement]] → [[Back Control]] or [[Mount]] (when opponent focuses on grip defense)

## Expert Insights
- **Danaher System**: Emphasizes the kimura as a "control system" rather than merely a submission attempt, focusing on the grip as a mechanical advantage that limits opponent's defensive options while creating systematic pathways to either finish the submission or advance position. Systematizes kimura applications into distinct categories based on starting position, teaching practitioners to recognize which variation applies to specific scenarios and how to chain kimura attempts with complementary attacks.
- **Gordon Ryan**: Utilizes kimura control as a primary tool for creating back take opportunities in competition, often valuing the positional advancement over the submission finish itself. Focuses on maintaining kimura grip through transitions and scrambles, using the arm control as a "steering wheel" that directs opponent's movement and prevents effective defensive responses while setting up dominant positions.
- **Eddie Bravo**: Has developed numerous kimura variations within the 10th Planet system including the "Carni-Kimura" and specialized entries from rubber guard positions. Emphasizes creative kimura applications that opponents may not have trained to defend, often combining kimura threats with leg attack entries, twister setups, and unconventional back takes that exploit opponent's focus on defending the arm control.

## Common Errors
- **Shallow grip without full figure-four completion** → Allows opponent to escape through grip breaking
- **Poor angle creation limiting rotational leverage** → Reduces submission pressure effectiveness
- **Static position without progressive pressure application** → Gives opponent time to develop defensive responses
- **Releasing grip prematurely during transitions** → Loses control point and attacking opportunity
- **Explosive jerking movements creating injury risk** → Dangerous application and telegraphs submission attempt
- **Focusing only on submission without recognizing positional opportunities** → Misses high-percentage position advancements

## Training Drills
- **Grip Establishment Practice** - Repetitive drilling of figure-four grip creation from various starting positions with focus on hand positioning and grip security, building automatic response patterns when arm becomes available
- **Submission Pressure Application** - Controlled submission attempts with partner providing feedback on pressure intensity and angle optimization, developing ability to apply effective submission pressure without injury risk
- **Positional Flow Drilling** - Flowing from kimura control to back take, mount, and side control transitions with increasing resistance, building ability to maintain grip while advancing position
- **Defense Recognition Training** - Partner applies common defensive responses while practitioner adapts kimura application appropriately, developing ability to read and counter defensive tactics
- **Entry Timing Development** - Practicing kimura entries from various positions (guard, top control, scrambles) with moving resistance, developing opportunistic grip establishment ability

## Related Positions
- [[Kimura Trap Position]] - Specialized variation with trapped arm positioning creating enhanced control
- [[Side Control]] - Common position for establishing kimura control from top position
- [[Closed Guard Bottom]] - Frequent position for initiating kimura attacks from guard
- [[Back Control]] - Common destination when using kimura for positional advancement
- [[North-South]] - Alternative top position providing kimura opportunities

## Decision Tree

**If** opponent defends shoulder by rolling toward trapped arm:
- Execute [[Rolling Kimura]] → [[Won by Submission]] (Probability: 60%)
- Or maintain grip and establish [[Back Control]] → [[Back Control]] (Probability: 70%)

**Else if** opponent attempts to frame and create space:
- Use kimura grip to drive into [[Side Control]] or [[Mount]] → [[Position Advancement]] (Probability: 65%)
- Or switch to [[Armbar]] if arm extends (Probability: 55%)

**Else if** opponent grips their own gi or body defensively:
- Apply progressive rotational pressure for [[Kimura Submission]] (Probability: 50%)
- Or use static defense to advance to [[Back Control]] (Probability: 65%)

**Else** (opponent shows confusion or poor defensive structure):
- Execute direct [[Kimura Submission Finish]] with optimal angle (Probability: 70%)

## Position Metrics
- Success Rate: 60% submission or position advancement (competition data)
- Average Time in Position: 30-90 seconds
- Submission Probability: 40% (when committed to finish)
- Positional Advancement Probability: 65% (to back control or mount)
- Position Loss Probability: 30% (if grip is broken or escaped)

## Optimal Submission Paths

**Fastest path to submission** (direct attack):
[[Kimura Control Position]] → [[Kimura Submission Finish]] → [[Won by Submission]]
*Reasoning: Direct submission from controlled position when opponent makes defensive error or lacks kimura defense understanding*

**High-percentage path** (systematic):
[[Kimura Control Position]] → [[Back Take from Kimura]] → [[Back Control]] → [[Rear Naked Choke]] → [[Won by Submission]]
*Reasoning: Using kimura to achieve dominant position then attacking from superior control creates higher overall success rate*

**Alternative submission path** (chain attack):
[[Kimura Control Position]] → [[Opponent Defends]] → [[Armbar from Kimura]] → [[Armbar Control]] → [[Won by Submission]]
*Reasoning: When opponent extends arm to defend kimura, immediate armbar becomes high-percentage alternative*

**Sweep to dominance path** (from guard):
[[Closed Guard Bottom]] → [[Kimura Sweep]] → [[Top Side Control]] → [[Kimura Finish from Top]] → [[Won by Submission]]
*Reasoning: Establishing kimura from guard, using it to sweep, then finishing from dominant top position*
