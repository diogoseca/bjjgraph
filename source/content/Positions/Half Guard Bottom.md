# Half Guard Bottom
#bjj #state #guard #halfguard #bottom

## State Properties
- **State ID**: S006
- **Point Value**: 0 (Slight disadvantage)
- **Position Type**: Defensive with offensive options
- **Risk Level**: Medium
- **Energy Cost**: Medium to High
- **Time Sustainability**: Medium

## State Description
Half Guard Bottom is a fundamental position where the bottom player has one of the opponent's legs trapped between their own legs. This position serves as both a defensive recovery option when escaping from worse positions and as an offensive launching pad for sweeps and submissions. Half Guard offers more defensive security than being fully passed, but less offensive capability than full guard.

## Visual Description

You are positioned on your side or back with one of the opponent's legs captured and controlled between both of your legs, typically with your inner thigh clamping their shin or knee. Your outside leg hooks over their trapped leg for control, while your inside leg threads underneath to complete the entanglement. The opponent is typically in a top position, chest-to-chest or at an angle, attempting to apply pressure through a crossface or underhook to flatten you to the mat. Your upper body fights for an underhook on one side to create frames and prevent flattening, while your outside arm creates distance through frames or grips. This asymmetric configuration creates a dynamic battlefield where your goal is to prevent the opponent from fully passing while using the trapped leg as an anchor point for sweeps, while the opponent attempts to free their leg and advance to side control or mount.

## Key Principles
- Control the underhook on at least one side
- Prevent crossface and head control
- Establish a strong frame to create space
- Control opponent's hips and prevent flattening
- Create and maintain angles (never stay flat)
- Threaten sweeps constantly to prevent opponent's passing progression

## Prerequisites
- Basic hip mobility and leg strength
- Understanding of underhook mechanics
- Ability to maintain knee/elbow connection

## State Invariants
- One of opponent's legs trapped between your legs
- Opponent cannot fully establish side control
- Your hips are not completely flat or controlled

## Defensive Responses (When Opponent Has This State)
- [[Crossface and Underhook]] → [[Half Guard Pass Sequence]]
- [[Knee Cut Attempt]] → [[Knee Cut Pass]]
- [[Flatten and Control]] → [[Half Guard Pin]]
- [[Back Step]] → [[Reverse Half Guard]]

## Offensive Transitions (Available From This State)
- [[Old School Sweep]] → [[Top Half Guard]] or [[Side Control]]
- [[Deep Half Entry]] → [[Deep Half Guard]]
- [[Underhook Sweep]] → [[Top Position]]
- [[Knee Shield Transition]] → [[Knee Shield Half Guard]]
- [[Half Guard to Closed Guard]] → [[Closed Guard Bottom]]
- [[Kimura from Half Guard]] → [[Kimura Control]]
- [[Electric Chair Sweep]] → [[Electric Chair Control]]
- [[John Wayne Sweep]] → [[Side Control Top]]

## Counter Transitions
- [[Half Guard Recovery]] → [[Half Guard Bottom]] (against pass attempts)
- [[Half Guard Reguard]] → [[Half Guard Bottom]] (from worse positions)
- [[Lockdown Control]] → [[Lockdown Half Guard]] (stabilizing control)

## Expert Insights
- **Danaher System**: Emphasizes the "Inside Position Theory" in half guard, focusing on establishing the underhook as the primary battle. Creates systematic defensive structures to prevent flattening while setting up a methodical progression of sweeps and back takes.
- **Gordon Ryan**: Uses half guard primarily as a transitional position on the path to deeper guards like butterfly or X-guard. When playing half guard, focuses on creating immediate sweep threats that force the opponent to post and open opportunities for submissions or back takes.
- **Eddie Bravo**: Revolutionized half guard with the development of the "Lockdown" system, using specific leg entanglement to immobilize the opponent's trapped leg and create powerful sweeping leverage. Connects half guard directly to electric chair sweeps and the "Dogfight" position.

## Common Errors
- Staying flat on back → Vulnerability to crossface and pressure
- Failing to establish underhook → Limited offensive options
- Focusing only on defense → Allowing opponent to advance position
- Poor knee/elbow connection → Vulnerability to passing
- Over-committing to single techniques → Predictable patterns

## Training Drills
- Half guard recovery against increasing pressure
- Underhook battle sequences with alternating objectives
- Sweep combinations linking multiple attacks
- Frame and create space drills
- Transitional flows between half guard variations

## Related States
- [[Knee Shield Half Guard]] - Defensive variation with additional framing
- [[Deep Half Guard]] - Offensive variation with upper body control
- [[Lockdown Half Guard]] - Eddie Bravo's control-focused variation
- [[Z-Guard]] - Angled knee shield variation
- [[93 Guard]] - Modified half guard with lapel control (gi)

## Decision Tree
If opponent establishes strong crossface:
- Execute [[Frame and Hip Escape]] → [[Knee Shield Half Guard]]

Else if opponent stands up:
- Execute [[Underhook and Deep Half]] → [[Deep Half Guard]]

Else if you secure strong underhook:
- Execute [[Old School Sweep]] or [[Plan B Sweep]]

Else if opponent is driving forward:
- Execute [[Lockdown]] → [[Electric Chair Sweep]]

## Position Metrics
- Success Rate: 55% recovery/advance (competition data)
- Average Time in Position: 1-2 minutes
- Sweep Probability: 40%
- Submission Probability: 20%
- Position Loss Probability: 40%

## Optimal Paths
The highest-percentage offensive path from this position:
[[Half Guard Bottom]] → [[Underhook Secure]] → [[Old School Sweep]] → [[Side Control Top]] → [[Mount]] → [[Arm Triangle]] → [[Won by Submission]]

Defensive recovery path:
[[Half Guard Bottom]] → [[Knee Shield Transition]] → [[Half Guard to Closed Guard]] → [[Closed Guard Bottom]] → Offensive sequence

## Computer Science Analogy
Half guard represents a key "branching node" in the BJJ state machine with high connectivity to multiple paths - it offers transitions to both better positions (closed guard, deep half) and worse ones (side control). This makes it a critical decision point with significant impact on the match trajectory.
