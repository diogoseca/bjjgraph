# Lockdown Half Guard Variations Bottom
#bjj #state #halfguard #10thplanet #lockdown #variations #bottom

## State Properties
- **State ID**: S180
- **Point Value**: 0 (Neutral position with offensive potential)
- **Position Type**: Offensive/Control
- **Risk Level**: Medium
- **Energy Cost**: Medium to High
- **Time Sustainability**: Medium

## State Description

Lockdown Half Guard Variations represent the advanced offensive and control options available from the fundamental Lockdown position within the 10th Planet system. These variations extend beyond basic Lockdown mechanics to include specialized attacking setups like the Electric Chair, Vaporizer, Plan B, and modified whip-up techniques that create unique offensive opportunities. Unlike standard half guard positions that rely primarily on underhook battles, Lockdown variations leverage the powerful leg entanglement to create unconventional attacking angles and control mechanisms that opponents often haven't trained to defend. The position serves as a comprehensive offensive system where the basic Lockdown control becomes a launching platform for multiple attack pathways.

These variations are particularly effective in no-gi grappling where traditional gi-based controls are unavailable, though they translate effectively to gi competition as well. The system emphasizes creative problem-solving and opportunistic attacks rather than rigid technique sequences, encouraging practitioners to flow between variations based on opponent reactions. Mastery of these variations transforms the Lockdown from a simple control position into a dynamic offensive hub.

## Visual Description

You are on your back in half guard with your bottom leg hooked around your opponent's trapped leg and your top leg secured over your own ankle in the characteristic Lockdown figure-four configuration. Your opponent is in your half guard with one leg trapped and their weight distributed across your torso. Depending on the specific variation, your upper body positioning changes: for Electric Chair setups, you establish an underhook on the trapped leg side and begin turning away while maintaining lockdown tension; for Vaporizer entries, you secure a deep underhook with your head positioned under opponent's far armpit; for Plan B sweeps, you establish frames against opponent's far hip while maintaining strong lockdown control. Your hips remain mobile and active, constantly adjusting pressure and angle through the lockdown mechanism to off-balance opponent and create attacking opportunities. Your free hand controls opponent's far arm or establishes frames preventing them from establishing dominant crossface or underhook control. The spatial relationship creates asymmetry where opponent's trapped leg serves as a fulcrum for leverage-based attacks while their upper body remains engaged in controlling battles. This configuration enables rapid transitions between variation options based on opponent's defensive responses, maintaining constant offensive threat pressure.

## Key Principles

- **Lockdown Tension Maintenance**: Establish and maintain strong figure-four leg control as foundation for all variations
- **Upper Body Variation**: Adapt upper body positioning specific to each variation's mechanical requirements
- **Hip Mobility**: Use active hip movement to create angles and off-balance opponent for variation entries
- **Opportunistic Transitions**: Flow between variations based on opponent's defensive reactions rather than forcing single attacks
- **Frame Management**: Establish appropriate frames to prevent opponent from flattening while creating attack opportunities
- **Energy Efficiency**: Select variations appropriate to current energy reserves and opponent's defensive focus
- **System Integration**: Understand how variations connect to create attacking chains where defending one opens another

## Decision Tree

**If** opponent establishes strong crossface and upper body control:
- Execute [[Return to Standard Lockdown]] → [[Lockdown Guard]] (Probability: 60%)
  - Reasoning: Consolidate position and defend before attempting advanced variations
- Or Execute [[Whip Up to Deep Half]] → [[Deep Half Guard]] (Probability: 50%)
  - Reasoning: Escape upper body pressure by entering deep half where crossface is less effective

**Else if** opponent postures up with wide base and extended arms:
- Execute [[Electric Chair Entry]] → [[Electric Chair]] (Probability: 55%)
  - Reasoning: Upright posture creates opportunity for underhook and Electric Chair mechanics
- Or Execute [[Vaporizer Entry]] → [[Vaporizer Control]] (Probability: 45%)
  - Reasoning: Extended arms allow deep underhook entry for Vaporizer attack

**Else if** opponent drives weight forward and attempts to flatten:
- Execute [[Plan B Sweep]] → [[Top Position]] (Probability: 60%)
  - Reasoning: Forward pressure can be redirected using Plan B framing and hip mechanics
- Or Execute [[Whip Up to Dogfight]] → [[Dogfight Position]] (Probability: 55%)
  - Reasoning: Use opponent's forward pressure to generate whip-up momentum

**Else if** opponent attempts to free trapped leg through back-stepping:
- Execute [[Whip Up to Truck]] → [[Truck Position]] (Probability: 40%)
  - Reasoning: Back-step attempt exposes back and creates truck entry opportunity
- Or Execute [[Electric Chair to Back Take]] → [[Back Control]] (Probability: 45%)
  - Reasoning: Leg extraction attempt can be countered with back take when timing is correct

**Else** (opponent maintains balanced, defensive posture):
- Execute [[Electric Chair Entry]] → [[Electric Chair]] (Probability: 45%)
  - Reasoning: Test defenses with highest-percentage variation attack
- Or Execute [[Plan B Sweep]] → [[Top Position]] (Probability: 50%)
  - Reasoning: Create reaction with Plan B setup to open other attacking opportunities

## Expert Insights

**John Danaher**: While not a primary proponent of the Lockdown system, acknowledges the mechanical sophistication of its variations when executed properly, particularly noting how the leg entanglement creates leverage advantages that can neutralize significant size and strength disparities. Emphasizes that effectiveness of these variations depends on maintaining proper lockdown tension throughout attacks—if the fundamental leg control deteriorates, the entire variation system becomes vulnerable. When analyzing 10th Planet practitioners, notes that the most successful ones understand the Lockdown variations not as isolated techniques but as interconnected systems where defending one attack predictably opens others, creating genuine dilemmas that force opponents into difficult choices.

**Gordon Ryan**: Rarely incorporates Lockdown variations in his personal game, preferring more traditional half guard approaches with underhook battles and knee shield controls that he finds more reliable under maximum competition pressure. However, recognizes the strategic value of Lockdown variations against opponents unfamiliar with defending them, noting that the unconventional angles and attacks can create significant problems for traditionally trained practitioners. When discussing position selection, emphasizes that Lockdown variations may be most valuable as surprise weapons in competition rather than primary game plan elements, particularly effective when opponent has never faced them in training and lacks systematic defensive responses.

**Eddie Bravo**: As the architect of the 10th Planet system, considers Lockdown variations to be among the most important technical innovations in modern no-gi grappling, providing smaller practitioners with powerful offensive tools against larger opponents. Emphasizes the importance of treating variations as a flow system rather than isolated techniques—practitioners should move fluidly between Electric Chair, Vaporizer, and Plan B based on opponent reactions, never committing fully to single attacks. Teaches that the psychological impact of Lockdown variations is as important as technical execution: opponents accustomed to traditional half guard often feel uncomfortable and confused in Lockdown positions, creating mental pressure that amplifies technical advantages.

## Common Errors

### Error: Losing lockdown tension during variation entries
- **Consequence**: The fundamental leg control that enables all variations becomes compromised, allowing opponent to free trapped leg or establish dominant pressure. Variations lose mechanical effectiveness without proper lockdown foundation.
- **Correction**: Maintain constant awareness of lockdown tension throughout variation execution. Before committing fully to variation attack, ensure lockdown is secure and active. If tension begins to slip, return to fundamental lockdown position and re-establish control before attempting variations.
- **Recognition**: If you feel opponent's trapped leg gaining mobility or your own leg control becoming loose, lockdown tension is insufficient. Opponent should feel constant pressure and immobilization throughout variation attempts.

### Error: Forcing variations when upper body is controlled
- **Consequence**: Attempting Electric Chair, Vaporizer, or Plan B when opponent has established crossface or dominant upper body control leads to being flattened, passing attempts, or complete position loss. Variations require specific upper body positioning to function.
- **Correction**: If opponent establishes strong crossface or upper body dominance, return to fundamental lockdown position and focus on defending upper body before attempting variations. Use frames to prevent flattening, then re-establish positioning requirements for desired variation.
- **Recognition**: If you cannot establish underhooks or appropriate frames, if opponent's crossface is driving your face away and flattening your shoulders, upper body control is too compromised for variation attacks.

### Error: Sequential technique attempts without flow
- **Consequence**: Attempting one variation, having it defended, then completely resetting before attempting another creates predictable patterns and gives opponent recovery time. Wastes the fundamental advantage of variation systems: creating dilemmas through connected attacks.
- **Correction**: Practice flowing immediately from one variation to another when defenses are encountered. Electric Chair defense should trigger immediate Plan B or Vaporizer attempt. Treat variations as branches of single attacking tree rather than isolated techniques.
- **Recognition**: If there are pauses or resets between variation attempts, if opponent has time to fully stabilize between your attacks, you're not flowing properly between variations.

### Error: Over-committing energy to low-percentage variations
- **Consequence**: Spending excessive energy on advanced variations like Whip Up to Truck when simpler, higher-percentage options like Plan B are available leads to fatigue without position improvement. Energy inefficiency compromises later attacking opportunities.
- **Correction**: Select variations appropriate to skill level, energy reserves, and opponent characteristics. Beginner/intermediate practitioners should emphasize Electric Chair, Plan B, and basic Whip Up variations before attempting complex Truck entries or Vaporizer attacks.
- **Recognition**: If you're exhausted after failed variation attempts while opponent remains relatively fresh, if you're attempting highlight-reel techniques when fundamentals would be more effective, energy allocation is poor.

### Error: Neglecting defensive awareness during variation attacks
- **Consequence**: Becoming so focused on offensive variation execution that you fail to defend against opponent's counters (knee slice passes, back steps, crossface dominance) results in losing position entirely despite having attacking opportunities.
- **Correction**: Maintain defensive awareness throughout variation attempts. Keep frames active to prevent flattening, monitor opponent's leg position for pass attempts, and be prepared to abandon variation if defensive requirements aren't met. Variation offense must be balanced with position maintenance.
- **Recognition**: If opponents regularly pass or establish dominant control while you're attempting variations, if you're frequently getting flattened or back-stepped on, defensive awareness is insufficient.

### Error: Rigid variation selection without reading opponent reactions
- **Consequence**: Deciding on specific variation in advance and forcing it regardless of opponent's positioning or defensive focus results in low success rates and wasted energy. Effective variation use requires responsive decision-making based on what opponent gives you.
- **Correction**: Assess opponent's defensive focus and positioning before committing to specific variation. If they're heavy and driving forward, Plan B becomes higher percentage. If they're upright with extended arms, Electric Chair or Vaporizer are favored. Read reactions and adjust.
- **Recognition**: If you're repeatedly attempting same variation despite it being defended consistently, if you can't articulate why you selected specific variation based on opponent's position, you're not reading situations properly.

### Error: Incomplete understanding of variation mechanics
- **Consequence**: Attempting variations without understanding the biomechanical principles that make them work (leverage points, angle creation, timing windows) results in poor execution and low success rates despite adequate positioning.
- **Correction**: Study variation mechanics systematically, understanding not just the steps but why each step works. Electric Chair requires turning away to create hip elevation and leverage. Vaporizer needs deep underhook to generate lift. Plan B uses hip frames and leg extension together. Practice mechanics slowly before adding resistance.
- **Recognition**: If variations feel like they should work but consistently fail despite proper positioning, if you can't explain why specific variation is effective against opponent's defense, mechanical understanding is incomplete.

## Training Drills

### Drill 1: Variation Flow Chains
Start in established lockdown position with partner providing 25% resistance. Execute planned variation sequences: Electric Chair entry → if defended, immediate Plan B transition → if defended, Whip Up to Dogfight. Focus on maintaining lockdown tension throughout entire chain while flowing smoothly between variations without resets. Partner gradually increases resistance to 50%, then 75% as flow improves. Practice 5-minute rounds, alternating roles. Success metric: completing 3-variation chains without losing lockdown control or requiring position resets. Progressive challenge: partner randomly defends one variation per chain, forcing adaptive flow to alternatives.

### Drill 2: Variation Selection Based on Opponent Position
Partner assumes different defensive postures in your lockdown (upright with extended arms, heavy forward pressure with crossface, wide base with hands posted, attempting back-step). You select and execute most appropriate variation for each defensive configuration. Start with partner holding static positions for 10 seconds each, allowing analysis. Progress to dynamic transitions between defensive postures every 5 seconds, requiring rapid variation selection. Focus points: recognizing positional cues, understanding which variations work against which defenses, developing pattern recognition. 10-minute rounds with position rotation every 2 minutes.

### Drill 3: Lockdown Maintenance During Variation Execution
Partner actively attempts to free trapped leg and establish dominant control while you execute variations. Focus exclusively on maintaining lockdown tension throughout all variation attempts—if lockdown control deteriorates, immediately return to fundamental position and re-establish before continuing. Start at 50% resistance with partner providing clear signals when lockdown weakens. Progress to 75% then competition-level resistance. 8-minute rounds, 2-minute rest. Success metric: maintaining lockdown integrity for >90% of drill duration while still attempting variations. Emphasis on not sacrificing fundamental control for aggressive variation attempts.

### Drill 4: Variation Contingency Development
Start in lockdown with specific variation assigned (Electric Chair, Vaporizer, Plan B). Execute variation until partner successfully defends using pre-determined defense (crossface, back-step, base widening). Upon defense, immediately flow to most appropriate contingency variation without resetting. Partner provides 60% resistance, allowing successful execution when correct contingency is chosen. Focus on reading defensive responses and selecting logical follow-up attacks. Practice each primary variation → contingency flow for 3 minutes, then rotate. Develops understanding of how variations connect defensively and offensively.

### Drill 5: Positional Sparring from Lockdown Variations
Begin in established lockdown with you attempting to execute any variation to successful sweep or submission setup. Partner attempts to pass, free trapped leg, or establish dominant control. Full resistance (100%) but resetting to lockdown position whenever guard is passed or you achieve top position. 5-minute rounds emphasizing realistic variation application under maximum resistance. Record success rates for different variations to identify high-percentage options for your game. Partner provides feedback on which variation entries felt most threatening and why. Develops realistic understanding of variation effectiveness and personal strengths within system.

## Optimal Submission Paths

**Fastest path to submission** (Electric Chair route):
[[Lockdown Half Guard Variations Bottom]] → [[Electric Chair Entry]] → [[Electric Chair]] → [[Electric Chair Submission]] → [[Won by Submission]]
*Reasoning: Direct path to signature 10th Planet submission when opponent is upright and lockdown tension is strong. Success depends on deep underhook and opponent unfamiliarity with defense. Average time: 15-30 seconds from variation entry.*

**High-percentage path** (Sweep to dominance):
[[Lockdown Half Guard Variations Bottom]] → [[Plan B Sweep]] → [[Top Half Guard]] → [[Pass to Side Control Top]] → [[Mount Top]] → [[Arm Triangle]] → [[Won by Submission]]
*Reasoning: Plan B sweep has highest success rate among variations, leading to top position where you can progress systematically to mount and submission. More reliable than direct submission attempts from bottom. Average time: 60-90 seconds.*

**Alternative submission path** (Vaporizer route):
[[Lockdown Half Guard Variations Bottom]] → [[Vaporizer Entry]] → [[Vaporizer Control]] → [[Vaporizer Sweep]] → [[Top Position]] → [[Back Take]] → [[Rear Naked Choke]] → [[Won by Submission]]
*Reasoning: Vaporizer creates unique angles for both submission and sweep, with back take opportunities when opponent defends sweep. Lower success rate than Plan B but higher finish rate when successful. Average time: 45-60 seconds.*

**System-based path** (10th Planet chain):
[[Lockdown Half Guard Variations Bottom]] → [[Whip Up to Truck]] → [[Truck Position]] → [[Twister Setup]] → [[Twister Finish]] → [[Won by Submission]]
*Reasoning: Follows Eddie Bravo's systematic approach of using lockdown to access truck and twister positions. Most technical path requiring highest skill level but potentially highest finish rate against unfamiliar opponents. Average time: 90-120 seconds.*

**Competition points path** (safe progression):
[[Lockdown Half Guard Variations Bottom]] → [[Electric Chair Sweep]] → [[Side Control Top]] (+3 points) → [[Mount Top]] (+4 points) → [[Submission Attempt]] (+2 advantages) → Points Victory or Submission
*Reasoning: Focuses on point accumulation rather than immediate submission, using variations to sweep and then advancing through positions for score. Most reliable competition approach. Average time: Full match duration with point advantage.*

## Position Metrics

- **Position Retention Rate**: Beginner 50%, Intermediate 65%, Advanced 75%
- **Successful Variation Entry Rate**: Beginner 35%, Intermediate 50%, Advanced 65%
- **Sweep Probability**: Beginner 30%, Intermediate 45%, Advanced 60%
- **Submission Setup Probability**: Beginner 20%, Intermediate 35%, Advanced 50%
- **Position Loss Probability**: Beginner 40%, Intermediate 30%, Advanced 20%
- **Average Time in Position**: 45-90 seconds (longer duration indicates strong control)
- **Energy Cost Per Minute**: Medium-High (maintaining lockdown tension and attempting variations requires sustained effort)

## Competition Considerations

**Point Scoring**: Neutral position (0 points) but successful sweeps from variations score 2 points under IBJJF rules. Advantages can be gained through aggressive variation attempts even when unsuccessful. ADCC rules favor this position due to emphasis on submission attempts and guard work.

**Time Management**: Lockdown variations work well in longer matches (10+ minutes) where you can methodically attack and create fatigue in opponent's trapped leg. In shorter matches (5-6 minutes), prioritize higher-percentage variations like Plan B and Electric Chair over advanced options like Truck entries.

**Rule Set Adaptations**: Gi competition allows additional gripping options for variation control but also gives opponent more tools to defend. No-gi competition is ideal environment for lockdown variations where they were originally developed. Submission-only formats favor aggressive variation use since position loss has no point consequences.

**Competition Strategy**: Lockdown variations particularly effective as surprise tactics when opponent hasn't trained against 10th Planet system. Can be used strategically in tournament to confuse traditionally trained opponents. Less effective against experienced 10th Planet practitioners who know defensive systems. Consider using variations selectively based on opponent scouting rather than as primary game plan against all opponents.

## Historical Context

Lockdown Half Guard Variations emerged from Eddie Bravo's development of the 10th Planet Jiu-Jitsu system in the early 2000s, building on his foundational Lockdown position innovation. The Electric Chair, Vaporizer, Plan B, and Truck entries were systematically developed as Eddie refined his no-gi approach, with many variations emerging from experimentation during his rivalry with Royler Gracie. These positions gained widespread attention through Eddie's competition successes and subsequently through 10th Planet students like Geo Martinez, PJ Barch, and Richie Martinez demonstrating their effectiveness at high-level competition. Initially dismissed by traditional BJJ practitioners as overly complex or limited, Lockdown variations have gradually gained acceptance as legitimate half guard attacking systems, particularly in no-gi and submission-only formats. The positions represent a significant departure from traditional half guard approaches, emphasizing leg control and unconventional angles over classical underhook battles.
