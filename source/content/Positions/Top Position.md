# Top Position
#bjj #state #top #positional_control

## State Properties
- **State ID**: S014
- **Point Value**: 2 (Moderate advantage)
- **Position Type**: Transitional control position
- **Risk Level**: Low to Medium
- **Energy Cost**: Low to Medium
- **Time Sustainability**: Medium to Long

## State Description
Top Position refers to a family of advantageous positions where the practitioner is on top of the opponent with varying degrees of control. This state serves as a transitional hub between guard passing sequences and the establishment of more dominant pin positions like side control or mount. Top Position encompasses combat base, headquarters position, and various settling positions that occur immediately after a sweep or takedown. While not as controlling as established pins, this position offers strong offensive potential with relatively low defensive vulnerability.

## Visual Description

The practitioner is positioned above the opponent with their weight distributed through their knees, feet, and hands, maintaining a stable base while preventing the opponent from establishing full guard. The practitioner's posture varies from upright (as in combat base with one knee up) to more forward-leaning (as in headquarters with both hands posted), depending on the specific passing configuration. The opponent lies on their back or partially on their side, working to create frames with their arms and establish guard positions with their legs. The practitioner's hips are typically positioned over or near the opponent's hips or thighs, controlling distance and preventing guard closure. Upper body control varies - the practitioner may have grips on the opponent's gi, control of their head or arms, or simply maintain distance through strategic framing. This intermediate configuration creates a visible hierarchy where the top person has gravitational and positional advantages, but hasn't yet achieved the immobilizing control of side control or mount, resulting in a dynamic battlefield with active movement from both practitioners.

## Key Principles
- Maintain strong base through proper weight distribution
- Control opponent's hips to prevent guard recovery
- Establish frames to prevent opponent's mobility
- Create and maintain pressure appropriate to the specific position
- Anticipate and counter defensive movements
- Manage grips to facilitate intended transitions

## Prerequisites
- Basic understanding of weight distribution and base
- Familiarity with posture control
- Awareness of guard recovery mechanics
- Ability to recognize and exploit openings

## State Invariants
- Top player positioned above bottom player
- Some degree of control over opponent's hips or upper body
- Not fully established in a specific pin position
- Not caught in opponent's guard

## Defensive Responses (When Opponent Has This State)
- [[Guard Recovery]] → [[Guard Position]]
- [[Underhook and Turn]] → [[Turtle Position]]
- [[Technical Stand-up]] → [[Standing Neutral]]
- [[Create Frame]] → [[Defensive Position]]
- [[Shrimp and Elbow Escape]] → [[Half Guard Bottom]]

## Offensive Transitions (Available From This State)
- [[Pass to Side Control]] → [[Side Control]]
- [[Establish Mount]] → [[Mount]]
- [[Knee Cut Pass]] → [[Side Control]]
- [[Transition to North-South]] → [[North-South]]
- [[Leg Drag Pass]] → [[Side Control]]
- [[Combat Base to Back Take]] → [[Back Control]]
- [[Headquarters Control]] → [[Headquarters Position]]

## Counter Transitions
- [[Re-establish Top]] → [[Top Position]] (against escape attempts)
- [[Switch Pass Direction]] → [[Top Position]] (changing attack angle)
- [[Sprawl and Control]] → [[Front Headlock]] (if opponent turns away)

## Expert Insights
- **Danaher System**: Emphasizes the concept of "floating" top position, maintaining just enough pressure to control while remaining mobile enough to respond to defensive actions. Creates systematic decision trees based on opponent's frames and escape attempts to determine the most efficient pathway to a dominant pin.
- **Gordon Ryan**: Utilizes a headquarters-focused approach to top position, establishing a central hub position from which multiple passing options branch. Focuses on recognizing and exploiting the precise moment when the opponent commits to a specific defensive action, using their energy against them.
- **Eddie Bravo**: Often transitions quickly through conventional top position to establish more specialized control positions like the "Truck" or quarter mount. Emphasizes creating pressure through unconventional weight distribution that sets up unique submission entries rather than focusing on established pins.

## Common Errors
- Overcommitting weight → Vulnerability to sweeps
- Poor base management → Instability during transitions
- Neglecting hip control → Guard recovery opportunities
- Passive positioning → Giving opponent time to recover
- Rushing to finish → Skipping consolidation steps

## Training Drills
- Positional transitioning with progressive resistance
- Base recovery exercises when off-balanced
- Hip control and prevention sequences
- Pass completion chains from initial control
- Counter-response drills against common escapes

## Related States
- [[Side Control]] - More dominant pin position
- [[Mount]] - Highly dominant pin position
- [[Headquarters Position]] - Specialized top control position
- [[Combat Base]] - Specific kneeling posture for top control
- [[Knee Cut Position]] - Dynamic passing position


## Related Positions

- [[Side Control]] - Related position
- [[Mount]] - Related position
- [[North-South]] - Related position
- [[Headquarters Position]] - Related position
- [[Knee Cut Position]] - Related position

## Decision Tree
If opponent frames with inside arm:
- Execute [[Knee Cut Pass]] or [[Arm Drag to Back]]

Else if opponent attempts to recover guard:
- Execute [[Leg Drag Pass]] or [[Toreando Pass]]

Else if opponent turns away:
- Execute [[Combat Base to Back Take]]

Else if opponent pulls you forward:
- Execute [[Pressure Pass to Mount]]

## Position Metrics
- Success Rate: 75% progression to dominant position (competition data)
- Average Time in Position: 15-45 seconds
- Pass Completion Probability: 65%
- Submission Entry Probability: 25%
- Position Loss Probability: 20%

## Optimal Paths
Conservative path:
[[Top Position]] → [[Pass to Side Control]] → [[Side Control]] → [[Mount]] → submission chain

Aggressive path:
[[Top Position]] → [[Combat Base to Back Take]] → [[Back Control]] → [[Rear Naked Choke]] → [[Won by Submission]]

Modern path:
[[Top Position]] → [[Headquarters Control]] → [[Leg Drag Pass]] → [[Side Control]] → submission chain

## Computer Science Analogy
Top Position functions as a high-connectivity routing node in the BJJ state graph with multiple outbound edges to advantageous states. It represents a decision point with high branching factor, allowing selection of optimal paths based on opponent resistance patterns. The state serves as a buffer between lower-control and higher-control positions, with weight distribution serving as the key control variable that affects transition probabilities.
