# Backside 50-50 Bottom
#bjj #state #leg-entanglement #bottom #no-gi

## State Properties
- **State ID**: S058
- **Point Value**: 0 (Neutral entanglement)
- **Position Type**: Defensive with offensive options
- **Risk Level**: High
- **Energy Cost**: Medium
- **Time Sustainability**: Medium

## State Description
Backside 50-50 Bottom is an advanced leg entanglement position where both practitioners have their legs intertwined, but the bottom player faces away from their opponent with their back exposed to the opponent's chest. This creates a unique configuration where both players have access to leg attacks, but the bottom player must be more defensive about their position while seeking opportunities to sweep or attack the legs.

This position is characterized by the mirrored leg entanglement typical of 50-50 variations, but with the critical difference that the bottom player's back is to the opponent, changing the mechanical advantages and available techniques. While offering legitimate attack opportunities, the bottom position in backside 50-50 requires careful management of defensive responsibilities.

Backside 50-50 Bottom is common in no-gi grappling and leg lock-focused competition, where it often arises from scrambles, failed leg attacks, or as a defensive position when transitioning between different leg entanglements. The position demands technical knowledge of leg lock mechanics and positional awareness to prevent being overwhelmed by the top player's advantages.

## Visual Description
You are on your back or side with your back facing your opponent's chest, creating a back-to-chest configuration. Your legs are entangled with your opponent's legs in a mirrored fashion, with your right leg controlling their left leg (or vice versa). Your outside leg wraps around their hip or thigh, creating a hook or control point, while your inside leg is positioned to control their far leg. Your opponent's chest presses against your back, giving them superior pressure and control. You must use your arms to post on the mat or frame against their body to create space and prevent being flattened. Your hips are mobile but under pressure from the top player, requiring constant adjustment to maintain attacking options and prevent position loss. The configuration creates mutual leg lock threats, but the top player has mechanical advantages that you must carefully navigate.

## Key Principles
- **Leg Entanglement Mechanics**: Maintain proper leg configuration to control opponent's movement while protecting your own legs from attacks
- **Hip Mobility**: Constant hip movement prevents opponent from settling into dominant control and creates offensive opportunities
- **Back Exposure Management**: Actively defend against back control attempts while maintaining leg entanglement advantages
- **Sweeping Mechanics**: Use leg entanglement and hip movement to off-balance opponent and reverse position
- **Leg Lock Awareness**: Understand available leg attacks for both players and defend appropriately
- **Position Before Submission**: Prioritize improving position over forcing submissions from inferior position
- **Space Creation**: Use frames and movement to prevent opponent from flattening you completely

## Offensive Transitions
From this position, you can execute:

### Leg Attacks
- [[Inside Heel Hook]] → [[Heel Hook Control]] (Success Rate: Beginner 25%, Intermediate 40%, Advanced 60%)
  - Attack opponent's exposed leg with inside heel hook configuration
- [[Kneebar from 50-50]] → [[Kneebar Control]] (Success Rate: Beginner 20%, Intermediate 35%, Advanced 55%)
  - Transition leg entanglement to kneebar position when opponent defends heel hook
- [[Toe Hold]] → [[Toe Hold Control]] (Success Rate: Beginner 20%, Intermediate 35%, Advanced 50%)
  - Alternative leg attack using foot control

### Sweeps
- [[Backside 50-50 Sweep]] → [[Backside 50-50 Top]] (Success Rate: Beginner 35%, Intermediate 50%, Advanced 70%)
  - Use leg entanglement and hip movement to reverse position to top
- [[Technical Standup]] → [[Standing Guard]] (Success Rate: Beginner 30%, Intermediate 45%, Advanced 60%)
  - Extract legs and stand up to establish standing guard position

### Position Improvements
- [[Standard 50-50 Transition]] → [[50-50 Guard Bottom]] (Success Rate: Beginner 40%, Intermediate 55%, Advanced 70%)
  - Rotate body to face opponent and establish standard 50-50 configuration
- [[Inside Ashi Garami Entry]] → [[Inside Ashi Garami Bottom]] (Success Rate: Beginner 35%, Intermediate 50%, Advanced 65%)
  - Transition to more controlled leg entanglement position

### Escapes
- [[Leg Extraction]] → [[Open Guard Bottom]] (Success Rate: Beginner 25%, Intermediate 40%, Advanced 55%)
  - Systematically extract legs from entanglement and recover guard position
- [[Roll Through Escape]] → [[Neutral Standing]] (Success Rate: Beginner 20%, Intermediate 35%, Advanced 50%)
  - Use rolling motion to extract and stand up

## Defensive Responses
When opponent has this position against you (you are in top):

- [[Pressure and Control]] → [[Backside 50-50 Top Maintained]] (Success Rate: 50%)
  - Maintain chest pressure on opponent's back and prevent their hip movement
- [[Top Leg Lock Attack]] → [[Leg Lock Control]] (Success Rate: 45%)
  - Attack bottom player's exposed legs with superior angle and pressure
- [[Back Take Transition]] → [[Back Control]] (Success Rate: 40%)
  - Transition from leg entanglement to back control position
- [[Smash Pass Entry]] → [[Pass Initiation]] (Success Rate: 35%)
  - Extract legs and transition to passing position

## Decision Tree

**If** opponent maintains heavy chest pressure and flat back:
- Execute [[Backside 50-50 Sweep]] → [[Backside 50-50 Top]] (Probability: 50%)
  - Reasoning: Opponent's static pressure creates leverage for reversal
- Or Execute [[Standard 50-50 Transition]] → [[50-50 Guard Bottom]] (Probability: 45%)
  - Reasoning: Face opponent to equalize position and remove back exposure

**Else if** opponent reaches for back control:
- Execute [[Leg Extraction]] → [[Open Guard Bottom]] (Probability: 40%)
  - Reasoning: Prevent back control by abandoning entanglement
- Or Execute [[Technical Standup]] → [[Standing Guard]] (Probability: 35%)
  - Reasoning: Stand up to eliminate back control threat

**Else if** opponent's leg position is compromised:
- Execute [[Inside Heel Hook]] → [[Heel Hook Control]] (Probability: 55%)
  - Reasoning: Capitalize on opponent's leg positioning error
- Or Execute [[Kneebar from 50-50]] → [[Kneebar Control]] (Probability: 45%)
  - Reasoning: Alternative leg attack when heel hook is defended

**Else** (balanced opponent with good position):
- Maintain leg control and work [[Backside 50-50 Sweep]] → [[Backside 50-50 Top]] (Probability: 40%)
  - Reasoning: Create movement to off-balance and reverse position
- Or Execute [[Standard 50-50 Transition]] → [[50-50 Guard Bottom]] (Probability: 35%)
  - Reasoning: Improve position by facing opponent

## Expert Insights

**John Danaher**: "The backside 50-50 is often perceived as a defensive position, but this is a misconception. While the top player has mechanical advantages in terms of pressure and back exposure, the bottom player has significant attacking options if they understand the position's mechanics. The key is to never accept being flattened on your back - you must stay active on your hip, creating angles that both defend against the opponent's attacks and create your own offensive opportunities. The sweep from backside 50-50 is actually quite high percentage because the opponent is focused on leg attacks and back control, not on base maintenance. Use this to your advantage. Position first - establish the sweep or face your opponent - then work submissions. The bottom player who rushes to leg locks from this position typically loses."

**Gordon Ryan**: "I've been in backside 50-50 bottom plenty of times in competition, and my first thought is always to reverse position or rotate to face them. The top player has too many advantages - they can pressure you, they can see your leg better, and they can threaten your back. If I'm stuck here, I'm immediately working to sweep or rotate to standard 50-50. Now, if they make a mistake with their leg positioning, I'll attack the heel hook, but that's opportunistic, not my primary plan. Too many guys get stuck in backside 50-50 bottom and try to force leg locks - they end up getting passed or having their back taken. Smart leg lockers know this position is temporary and work to improve it immediately."

**Eddie Bravo**: "Backside 50-50 comes up a lot in 10th Planet because we play a lot of leg locks and we're not afraid of inverted positions. My guys train to be comfortable here because it's part of the scramble game. But even we don't want to stay here long. You use it to set up the reversal or to bait them into overcommitting so you can attack their legs. It's like being in a phone booth with someone - it's chaotic, both of you are in danger, so you better know what you're doing. We drill transitions from here constantly because the position appears and disappears quickly in live rolling. If you're stuck here and you don't know the escapes, you're going to have a bad time."

## Common Errors

### Error: Allowing opponent to flatten your back
- **Consequence**: Eliminates hip mobility and makes sweeps nearly impossible while giving opponent dominant pressure and control. Once flattened, opponent can focus entirely on attacking your legs or taking your back with minimal risk.
- **Correction**: Stay active on your side, never fully flat on your back. Use your top arm to post and create frames. Constantly adjust hip position to maintain angles. If being flattened, immediately bridge and turn to side.
- **Recognition**: If you feel opponent's full chest weight on your back and can't move your hips, you're too flat.

### Error: Ignoring back exposure threats
- **Consequence**: Opponent transitions to back control, abandoning leg entanglement for a dominant position worth 4 points with superior submission opportunities. Back control is significantly worse than backside 50-50 bottom.
- **Correction**: Monitor opponent's hands and upper body positioning constantly. If they release leg entanglement control to reach for your neck or shoulders, immediately work to face them or extract legs. Prioritize preventing back control over leg attacks.
- **Recognition**: If opponent's hips start moving up your body or their hands start reaching for your upper body, back control is imminent.

### Error: Over-committing to leg locks from bottom
- **Consequence**: Creates opportunities for opponent to improve position, pass your guard, or secure back control while you're focused on submissions. Attempting submissions from inferior position often results in position loss.
- **Correction**: Attack leg locks opportunistically when opponent makes errors, but prioritize position improvement (sweep or face opponent) as primary objective. Use leg lock threats to create reactions that enable sweeps.
- **Recognition**: If you've attempted multiple leg locks without success and opponent's position is getting better, you're over-committing.

### Error: Static leg positioning
- **Consequence**: Opponent easily maintains control and settles into their preferred configuration, eliminating your offensive options and making their attacks more effective. Static bottom play in leg entanglements is defensive failure.
- **Correction**: Constantly adjust leg positions, changing angles and configurations to prevent opponent from settling. Movement creates opportunities for sweeps and makes opponent's attacks less precise. Be a moving target.
- **Recognition**: If opponent feels comfortable and settled, your legs aren't moving enough.

### Error: Poor hip mobility and base
- **Consequence**: Unable to create angles for sweeps or defend against opponent's pressure, resulting in being controlled and attacked without ability to improve position. Hip mobility is your primary weapon from bottom.
- **Correction**: Develop strong hip movement patterns through drilling. Use free leg to create leverage. Post with hands to create base for hip movement. Bridge and turn to create angles even under pressure.
- **Recognition**: If your hips feel stuck or you can't create any movement, your base and hip mobility need attention.

### Error: Neglecting arm positioning
- **Consequence**: Arms trapped or poorly positioned, eliminating ability to post, frame, or defend against back control attempts. Arms are critical tools for managing bottom position.
- **Correction**: Keep top arm active for posting and framing. Bottom arm protects neck and prevents back control grips. Never let both arms get trapped or controlled. Arms create the frames that enable hip movement.
- **Recognition**: If your arms are pinned to your body or opponent controls both, you've lost arm positioning battle.

### Error: Rushing position changes
- **Consequence**: Creates scrambles where opponent can capitalize on your movement to improve their position or secure back control. Uncontrolled movement from backside 50-50 often results in worse positions.
- **Correction**: Position changes must be systematic and controlled. Secure necessary grips and controls before transitioning. Have clear destination and pathway for position changes. Don't panic - move with purpose.
- **Recognition**: If position changes result in worse positions repeatedly, you're rushing and need to slow down.

## Training Drills

### Drill 1: Backside 50-50 Sweep Mechanics
Start in backside 50-50 bottom with partner providing 25% resistance. Focus on hip movement, leg positioning, and using entanglement leverage to off-balance opponent and reverse position. Partner gradually increases resistance (25%, 50%, 75%) as you develop feel for the sweep mechanics. Practice both explosive and technical sweep entries. Emphasize maintaining leg entanglement throughout the sweep - don't release too early. 5 minutes per side, reset to bottom after each successful sweep.

### Drill 2: Position Transition Flow
Begin in backside 50-50 bottom, flow between different transitions: sweep to top, rotate to standard 50-50, extract to open guard, technical standup. Partner maintains constant light pressure (30%) but doesn't actively resist transitions. Goal is to develop smooth movement patterns and understand connections between different escape options. Focus on maintaining leg control throughout transitions and not exposing yourself to passes during position changes. 7 minutes continuous flow, switch roles.

### Drill 3: Defensive Awareness and Counters
Partner in backside 50-50 top attempts various attacks: back control transitions, leg locks, pressure passing. Your goal is to defend all attacks and create movement for position improvement. Start at 50% intensity, gradually increase to 75%. Focus on recognizing threats early and addressing them before they develop. Practice hand fighting, hip movement, and timely position changes based on opponent's attacks. 3-minute rounds with 1-minute rest, 5 rounds total.

### Drill 4: Leg Lock Attacks from Bottom
With partner maintaining static top position (no counters, just holding position), practice various leg lock entries from backside 50-50 bottom. Focus on inside heel hook, kneebar, and toe hold configurations. Emphasize proper mechanics and control before applying any pressure. Partner provides feedback on grip quality and positioning. Goal is to understand available attacks and their mechanics, not to finish. 4 minutes per side, slow and controlled application.

### Drill 5: Live Positional Sparring
Start in backside 50-50 bottom, partner in top. Full intensity positional sparring with specific goals: you work to sweep, improve position, or submit; partner works to maintain top, attack, or pass. Reset to starting position after any major position change (sweep, pass, submission attempt). This builds specific conditioning and problem-solving for the position. 2-minute rounds with 1-minute rest, 6 rounds, switch roles each round.

## Optimal Submission Paths

**Fastest path to submission** (opportunistic):
[[Backside 50-50 Bottom]] → [[Inside Heel Hook]] → [[Heel Hook Control]] → [[Won by Submission]]
*Reasoning: Direct attack if opponent's leg positioning is compromised. Low percentage from bottom but high reward. Requires opponent error.*

**High-percentage path** (positional):
[[Backside 50-50 Bottom]] → [[Backside 50-50 Sweep]] → [[Backside 50-50 Top]] → [[Inside Heel Hook]] → [[Won by Submission]]
*Reasoning: Improve position first, then attack from superior position. Much higher success rate and more systematic approach.*

**Alternative submission path** (rotation):
[[Backside 50-50 Bottom]] → [[Standard 50-50 Transition]] → [[50-50 Guard Bottom]] → [[Leg Lock Attack]] → [[Won by Submission]]
*Reasoning: Face opponent to equalize position, then work leg locks from neutral configuration. More defensive but creates better attacking platform.*

**Escape and reset path** (defensive):
[[Backside 50-50 Bottom]] → [[Leg Extraction]] → [[Open Guard Bottom]] → [[Guard Bottom Attack Chain]] → [[Won by Submission]]
*Reasoning: Extract from entanglement when position is unfavorable, recover to guard, and attack from preferred position. Safest approach when opponent has strong control.*

**Technical advancement path** (systematic):
[[Backside 50-50 Bottom]] → [[Inside Ashi Garami Entry]] → [[Inside Ashi Garami Bottom]] → [[Heel Hook Setup]] → [[Won by Submission]]
*Reasoning: Transition to more controlled entanglement position before attacking. Danaher's systematic approach to leg attacks - position before submission.*

## Position Metrics
- **Position Retention Rate**: Beginner 30%, Intermediate 45%, Advanced 65%
- **Advancement Probability**: Beginner 35%, Intermediate 50%, Advanced 70%
- **Submission Probability**: Beginner 20%, Intermediate 35%, Advanced 55%
- **Position Loss Probability**: Beginner 45%, Intermediate 35%, Advanced 20%
- **Average Time in Position**: 30-90 seconds (typically brief, transitional)

## Competition Considerations

**Point Scoring**: Backside 50-50 is typically scored as neutral (0 points) in IBJJF rules. ADCC treats leg entanglements as neutral. However, if opponent secures back control from here, that's 4 points, making back defense critical.

**Time Management**: This is generally a transitional position, not somewhere to stall. Referees may stand up competitors if both remain static without working. Use time here to improve position quickly.

**Rule Set Adaptations**: In IBJJF gi competition, leg locks are restricted or banned at most levels, making this position less common. In no-gi, ADCC, and submission-only formats where leg locks are legal, backside 50-50 appears frequently and requires technical proficiency.

**Competition Strategy**: Against leg lock specialists, avoid staying in backside 50-50 bottom - they're more comfortable here than you are. Work to sweep or extract immediately. Against guard players less experienced with leg locks, you may have more time to work, but still prioritize position improvement.
