#bjj #state #halfguard #passing #control

## State Properties
- **State ID**: S058
- **Point Value**: 2 (Advantageous passing control)
- **Position Type**: Dominant half guard position
- **Risk Level**: Low
- **Energy Cost**: Medium
- **Time Sustainability**: Medium to Long

## State Description
Flattened Half Guard represents a dominant variation of the Half Guard Top position where the top player has succeeded in breaking the bottom player's structure, forcing them flat onto their back with minimal defensive frames and hip mobility. Unlike standard Half Guard Top where the bottom player maintains some form of defensive structure (frames, knee shield, underhook), the Flattened Half Guard creates a scenario where passing becomes significantly more probable due to the neutralization of the bottom player's defensive capabilities. This position is characterized by the top player establishing smothering pressure while maintaining key control points that prevent the bottom player from recovering a defensive structure. The position serves as a critical transitional state between initial half guard engagement and successful guard passing.

## Key Principles
- Establish and maintain crossface/shoulder pressure against opponent's jaw/head
- Control opponent's hip mobility through strategic weight distribution
- Neutralize opponent's frames through proper pressure and positioning
- Prevent opponent's ability to recover underhook or knee shield
- Apply methodical pressure to limit opponent's breathing and mobility
- Create and exploit passing lanes while maintaining control
- Maximize control surface area against opponent's body
- Progress systematically through passing stages

## Prerequisites
- Understanding of half guard passing mechanics
- Recognition of defensive frame patterns
- Knowledge of pressure distribution principles
- Ability to maintain control through opponent's recovery attempts
- Awareness of common escapes and counters

## State Invariants
- Bottom player flat on back with minimal hip mobility
- Top player with established crossface or head control
- Top player's weight distributed effectively for control
- One leg of the top player still entangled in half guard
- Bottom player's defensive frames neutralized
- Clear pathway to passing sequences

## Defensive Responses (When Opponent Has This State)
- [[Bridge and Frame]] → [[Space Creation]]
- [[Knee Shield Recovery]] → [[Knee Shield Half Guard]]
- [[Underhook Drive]] → [[Traditional Half Guard]]
- [[Hip Escape Sequence]] → [[Guard Recovery]]
- [[Half Butterfly Recovery]] → [[Butterfly Half Guard]]

## Offensive Transitions (Available From This State)
- [[Pressure Pass]] → [[Side Control]]
- [[Knee Slide Completion]] → [[Side Control]]
- [[Flattened Half to Mount]] → [[Mount]]
- [[Back Step]] → [[Back Control]]
- [[Kimura Trap]] → [[Kimura Control]]
- [[D'arce Setup]] → [[D'arce Control]]
- [[North-South Transition]] → [[North-South]]
- [[Leg Weave Pass]] → [[Side Control]]

## Counter Transitions
- [[Re-establish Flattened Half]] → [[Flattened Half Guard]] (against recovery attempts)
- [[Switch to Combat Base]] → [[Combat Base]] (if position is compromised)
- [[Retreat to Half Guard Top]] → [[Half Guard Top]] (under significant pressure)

## Expert Insights
- **Danaher System**: Views the Flattened Half Guard as a critical achievement in the half guard passing sequence, emphasizing it as the position where defensive resources have been significantly depleted, making successful passing highly probable. Focuses on precise weight distribution and continual pressure that forces the bottom player to address immediate concerns rather than focusing on guard recovery. Particularly emphasizes maintaining shoulder pressure that prevents the bottom player from turning into the top player.
- **Gordon Ryan**: Approaches the Flattened Half Guard with a methodical mindset that balances between maintaining the control position and advancing to more dominant positions. Emphasizes the importance of recognizing and shutting down early stages of escape attempts rather than reacting to fully developed defensive movements. Places particular focus on controlling the bottom player's near-side arm to prevent framing.
- **Eddie Bravo**: While not as focused on top position control in his system, acknowledges the effectiveness of the Flattened Half Guard as a control position. When addressing the position from the top player's perspective, emphasizes creating submission threats that force defensive reactions that open up passing opportunities, particularly focusing on threat chains that connect various submissions.

## Common Errors
- Insufficient head/shoulder pressure → Defensive mobility
- Poor weight distribution → Loss of control
- Neglecting hip control → Recovery opportunity
- Premature passing attempt → Position compromise
- Static pressure application → Energy inefficiency
- Focusing solely on passing → Missing submission opportunities

## Training Drills
- Flattened Half Guard control maintenance against progressive resistance
- Transition flows between Flattened Half and passing positions
- Pressure application sensitivity development
- Defensive recognition and counter drills
- Control point maintenance against active defensive movement

## Decision Tree
If opponent attempts to bridge:
- Execute [[Pressure Pass]] or [[Flattened Half to Mount]]

Else if opponent fights for underhook:
- Execute [[Kimura Trap]] or [[D'arce Setup]]

Else if opponent attempts knee shield recovery:
- Execute [[Knee Slide Completion]] or [[Leg Weave Pass]]

Else if opponent turns away defensively:
- Execute [[Back Step]] or [[North-South Transition]]

## Position Metrics
- Success Rate: 80% pass completion probability
- Average Time in Position: 20-60 seconds
- Pass Completion Probability: 75%
- Submission Opportunity Probability: 40%
- Position Loss Probability: 15%

## Optimal Paths
Standard passing path:
[[Flattened Half Guard]] → [[Pressure Pass]] → [[Side Control]] → dominant position sequence

Mount transition path:
[[Flattened Half Guard]] → [[Flattened Half to Mount]] → [[Mount]] → submission options

Submission path:
[[Flattened Half Guard]] → [[Kimura Trap]] → [[Kimura Control]] → [[Won by Submission]]

## Historical Context
The Flattened Half Guard represents a fundamental development in the evolution of half guard passing methodology. While the half guard was once viewed primarily as a defensive or stalling position, the systematic development of pressure-based passing approaches led to the recognition of the flattened variation as a critical achievement in passing sequences. The position gained particular prominence through the influence of pressure passers like Bernardo Faria and Lucas Leite, who demonstrated the effectiveness of methodical pressure in neutralizing even highly developed half guard games. The position exemplifies the evolution of BJJ from a more movement-based approach to one that incorporates sophisticated pressure and control mechanics.

## Computer Science Analogy
The Flattened Half Guard functions as a "resource exhaustion state" in the BJJ state machine, where the defensive player's computational resources (frames, mobility, defensive options) have been systematically depleted, creating a scenario where the likelihood of transitioning to even more dominant states increases dramatically. This creates a form of "rate-limiting step" in the passing algorithm, where once this configuration is achieved, subsequent transitions become significantly more probable. The position exemplifies the concept of a "constrained optimization problem" where the controlling player methodically eliminates degrees of freedom until the problem space becomes trivial to solve.
