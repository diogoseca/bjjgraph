# Position Standard for BJJ State Machine
#bjj #standard #positions #statemachine

## Overview
This document defines the required structure and content for all position files in the BJJ state machine. Every position must include the standardized elements below to ensure proper integration with state machine processing, transition analysis, probability calculations, and comprehensive technical documentation.

## Required Properties for State Machine

### Core Identifiers
- **State ID**: Unique identifier (format: S###, e.g., S004)
- **Position Name**: Clear, descriptive name matching filename
- **Alternative Names**: Common alternative terminology

### State Properties
- **Point Value**: 0-4 points (IBJJF scoring system)
- **Position Type**: [Offensive/Defensive/Neutral/Controlling] - categorizes strategic role
- **Risk Level**: [Low/Medium/High] - vulnerability assessment
- **Energy Cost**: [Low/Medium/High] - physical demand to maintain position
- **Time Sustainability**: [Short/Medium/Long] - how long position can be held

### Success Probability Data
- **Position Retention Rate**: [Beginner/Intermediate/Advanced percentages]
- **Advancement Probability**: Chance to improve position
- **Submission Probability**: Direct submission threat from this position
- **Position Loss Probability**: Chance opponent escapes/reverses

## State Machine Content Elements

### Visual Description
Must include detailed physical positioning that enables:
- Clear spatial understanding and visualization
- Anatomical reference points (head, arms, legs, hips, torso placement)
- Weight distribution and pressure points
- Body orientation and angles

**Template**: "You [specific body position]. Your opponent [specific body position]. [Key pressure/control points]. [Spatial relationships and angles]."

### Defensive Responses (Available Counter-Actions)
When opponent has this position:
- **Counter-Attack Options**: Available submission attempts with success rates
- **Transition Options**: Position advancement moves with probabilities
- **Defensive Maintenance**: How opponent maintains control
- **Pressure Application**: How opponent increases dominance

Format: `[[Technique Name]] → [[Resulting State]] (Success Rate: X%)`

### Offensive Transitions (Available Actions)
From this position:
- **Submission Attempts**: Direct finish options with success rates
- **Position Improvements**: Transitions to better positions
- **Defensive Escapes**: Escapes to neutral/better positions (if applicable)
- **Control Enhancements**: Ways to improve current position control

Format: `[[Technique Name]] → [[Resulting State]] (Success Rate: Beginner X%, Intermediate Y%, Advanced Z%)`

### Decision Tree Logic
Structured decision-making logic:
```
If [condition]:
- Execute [[Action]] → [[Result State]] (Probability: X%)

Else if [condition]:
- Execute [[Action]] → [[Result State]] (Probability: Y%)

Else [default condition]:
- Execute [[Action]] → [[Result State]] (Probability: Z%)
```

## Educational & Commentary Content

### Expert Insights
Commentary as if from recognized authorities for authentic technical analysis:
- **John Danaher**: Technical, systematic approach emphasis
- **Gordon Ryan**: Competition-focused, high-percentage techniques
- **Eddie Bravo**: Innovation, rubber guard connections, 10th Planet methodology

Each insight should be 2-3 sentences providing specific technical or strategic guidance.

### Common Errors
For technical understanding and education:
- **Error Description**: What beginners typically do wrong
- **Consequence**: Why it's problematic
- **Correction**: Proper technique or mindset

### Key Principles
3-5 fundamental concepts that govern success in this position:
- Biomechanical advantages to maintain
- Control points that must be secured
- Tactical priorities for position play

### Prerequisites
Skills/positions that should be mastered before attempting this position:
- Required mobility or strength attributes
- Foundational techniques that lead to this position
- Basic concepts that must be understood

## State Machine Integration Elements

### State Invariants
Conditions that must remain true for this position to be maintained:
- Physical requirements (body positioning)
- Control requirements (grips, pressure, etc.)
- Opponent limitations (what they cannot do)

### Timing Considerations
When this position is most/least effective:
- Optimal setup conditions
- Vulnerable moments for transitions
- Energy/fatigue factors

### Training Scenarios
Practice situations for skill development:
- Progressive resistance drills
- Common reaction patterns to expect
- Flow sequences connecting to other positions

## Documentation Elements

### Descriptive Language
Rich, detailed descriptions for comprehensive documentation:
- Action verbs that convey movement and pressure
- Spatial descriptors for position clarity
- Technical context for understanding

### Coaching Cues
Short, memorable phrases for instruction:
- Technical reminders ("Keep your elbows tight")
- Strategic guidance ("Control the head, the body follows")
- Motivational elements ("Stay calm under pressure")

## Validation Checklist

Every position file must include:
- [ ] All required properties with specific values
- [ ] Detailed visual description (minimum 3 sentences)
- [ ] At least 3 defensive responses with success rates
- [ ] At least 3 offensive transitions with success rates
- [ ] Decision tree with minimum 3 branching conditions
- [ ] Expert insights from all three authorities
- [ ] Minimum 5 common errors with corrections
- [ ] Clear state invariants
- [ ] Training drill suggestions

## Example Implementation

See [[Mount]] for a complete example implementing all standard requirements.

## Notes for Developers

This standard ensures:
- Consistent data structure for state machine implementation
- Probability data for statistical analysis and calculations
- Rich content for comprehensive technical documentation
- Educational value through expert insights and error correction
- Visual description quality for clear understanding
- Structured decision logic for systematic analysis

Updates to this standard should be reflected across all position files to maintain consistency and completeness.
