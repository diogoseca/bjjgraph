#bjj #state #guard #singlegx #bottom #legentanglement

## State Properties
- **State ID**: S277
- **Point Value**: 0 (Guard position)
- **Position Type**: Offensive guard position
- **Risk Level**: Medium
- **Energy Cost**: Medium
- **Time Sustainability**: Medium

## State Description

Single Leg X Guard (SLX) Bottom is a highly effective guard position where the bottom player controls one of the opponent's legs using an X-frame configuration with their own legs. This position is particularly powerful against standing opponents and offers excellent sweeping mechanics through the combination of off-balancing and leg control. SLX is a fundamental position in modern BJJ, serving as both an attacking position and a transitional hub to other guard systems.

The position's effectiveness comes from the X-shaped leg configuration that traps the opponent's near leg while controlling their far leg with the foot, creating a mechanical advantage that makes it difficult for the opponent to maintain balance. This guard is especially prevalent in no-gi competition due to its reliability without grip dependencies.

## Visual Description

You are positioned on your back or partially inverted with your legs forming an X-shape around one of your opponent's legs. Your inside leg (the leg on the same side as the trapped leg) hooks behind the opponent's near knee, with your foot hooking around the back of their leg. Your outside leg extends across your body, with your foot pressing against the opponent's far hip or thigh, creating an outward pushing force. This X-configuration creates a stable control system that traps the opponent's near leg while off-balancing them. Your upper body is typically angled toward the opponent's trapped leg, with your arms working to control their near leg, ankle, or heel. The opponent is usually standing or in a low crouch, attempting to maintain balance and defend against the sweeping threats. Your hips are mobile and positioned to generate sweeping motion by extending and pulling simultaneously with your legs. The spatial relationship creates a mechanical advantage where your two legs control their one leg, making it difficult for them to establish stable base or escape the entanglement without giving up position.

## Key Principles

- **X-Frame Integrity**: Maintain the X-shape of legs - inside leg hooks, outside leg pushes
- **Hip Positioning**: Keep hips close to trapped leg for maximum control
- **Push-Pull Dynamic**: Simultaneously push with outside leg and pull with inside leg
- **Leg Elevation Control**: Elevate opponent's leg to compromise their balance
- **Constant Off-Balancing**: Never let opponent establish stable base
- **Upper Body Control**: Use hands to control trapped leg or ankle
- **Transition Readiness**: Be prepared to adjust to X-Guard, Ashi Garami, or technical standup

## Offensive Transitions

From this position, you can execute:

### Sweeps
- [[Single Leg X Sweep]] → [[Top Position]] (Success Rate: Beginner 50%, Intermediate 65%, Advanced 80%)
  - Classic SLX sweep using push-pull mechanics to off-balance opponent

- [[Technical Standup Sweep]] → [[Standing Position]] (Success Rate: Beginner 55%, Intermediate 70%, Advanced 85%)
  - Use SLX control to safely stand up while maintaining leg control

- [[Waiter Sweep]] → [[Top Position]] (Success Rate: Beginner 45%, Intermediate 60%, Advanced 75%)
  - Variation using underhook and leg elevation

### Guard Transitions
- [[X-Guard Transition]] → [[X-Guard]] (Success Rate: Beginner 50%, Intermediate 65%, Advanced 80%)
  - Add second leg control to achieve full X-Guard

- [[Ashi Garami Entry]] → [[Ashi Garami]] (Success Rate: Beginner 40%, Intermediate 55%, Advanced 70%)
  - Transition to leg lock position when opponent reacts

- [[Butterfly Guard Recovery]] → [[Butterfly Guard]] (Success Rate: Beginner 45%, Intermediate 60%, Advanced 75%)
  - Return to butterfly when SLX is compromised

### Advanced Attacks
- [[Back Take from SLX]] → [[Back Control]] (Success Rate: Beginner 35%, Intermediate 50%, Advanced 65%)
  - Attack back when opponent tries to step over

- [[Kneebar from SLX]] → [[Kneebar Control]] (Success Rate: Beginner 30%, Intermediate 45%, Advanced 60%)
  - Opportunistic leg lock when opponent's leg is extended

## Defensive Responses

When opponent has this position against you (top player perspective):

- [[Leg Extraction]] → [[Open Guard Top]] (Success Rate: 55%)
  - Extract leg and create distance

- [[Backstep Pass]] → [[Side Control Top]] (Success Rate: 50%)
  - Step back and around the guard structure

- [[Smash Pass]] → [[Side Control Top]] (Success Rate: 45%)
  - Drive forward and flatten opponent

- [[Jump Over]] → [[Guard Pass]] (Success Rate: 40%)
  - Jump over the leg entanglement

## Decision Tree

**If** opponent has high posture and good balance:
- Execute [[Technical Standup Sweep]] → [[Standing Position]] (Probability: 75%)
  - Reasoning: Use leg control to safely stand and neutralize their balance advantage

**Else if** opponent attempts to extract leg:
- Execute [[X-Guard Transition]] → [[X-Guard]] (Probability: 70%)
  - Reasoning: Add second leg to secure control before they escape

**Else if** opponent steps back to create distance:
- Execute [[Ashi Garami Entry]] → [[Ashi Garami]] (Probability: 65%)
  - Reasoning: Follow their backward motion and secure leg lock position

**Else** (opponent remains engaged in range):
- Execute [[Single Leg X Sweep]] → [[Top Position]] (Probability: 70%)
  - Reasoning: Classic sweep with strong mechanical advantage

## Expert Insights

**John Danaher**: "Single Leg X Guard represents one of the most mechanically sound guard positions in BJJ because it creates a true mechanical advantage - two legs controlling one leg. The key to understanding SLX is recognizing that it's fundamentally an off-balancing position, not a static holding position. Your legs must work in opposition: the inside leg pulls while the outside leg pushes, creating a rotational force that breaks the opponent's balance. The moment you achieve this position, you should immediately be working to sweep or transition. Static SLX is vulnerable SLX."

**Gordon Ryan**: "I use Single Leg X extensively in competition because it's nearly grip-independent, making it perfect for no-gi. The position also serves as a gateway to my entire leg lock game - from here I can transition to Ashi Garami, 50/50, or back control depending on how the opponent defends. The key is being aggressive with the off-balancing - I'm constantly elevating their leg and pushing their hips to keep them defensive. When they're worried about being swept, that's when I attack their trapped leg or transition to my preferred positions."

**Eddie Bravo**: "Single Leg X is a fundamental position in the 10th Planet system because it works perfectly in no-gi and integrates with our leg lock game. We emphasize the technical standup from SLX as one of the highest percentage sweeps in our curriculum. The beauty of this position is that it's relatively safe while offering multiple attacking options. We drill SLX entries from everywhere - butterfly guard, standing guard, even as a recovery from failed takedowns. It's become essential in modern no-gi competition."

## Common Errors

### Error: Keeping hips too far from the opponent's trapped leg
- **Consequence**: Distance weakens your control and reduces the mechanical advantage of the X-frame, allowing opponent to maintain balance and easily extract their leg or establish passing position
- **Correction**: Keep your hips close and connected to the trapped leg. Your inside leg's knee should be tight to their leg, and your hips should follow their leg as they move
- **Recognition**: If opponent easily maintains balance or extracts their leg without significant effort, your hips are likely too distant

### Error: Static leg configuration without active off-balancing
- **Consequence**: SLX becomes a holding position rather than an attacking position - opponent can gradually work their defenses and passing sequences without immediate threat
- **Correction**: Constantly elevate the trapped leg with your inside hook while pushing their far hip with your outside foot. Create continuous off-balancing motion
- **Recognition**: If opponent appears comfortable and stable in your SLX, you're not creating sufficient off-balancing pressure

### Error: Weak outside leg push on far hip
- **Consequence**: Without strong outward pressure on the far hip, the push-pull dynamic is compromised, reducing sweeping power and allowing opponent to establish stable base
- **Correction**: Actively extend your outside leg to create strong pushing pressure on opponent's far hip or thigh. This push is what creates the rotational off-balance
- **Recognition**: Difficulty sweeping despite good inside leg position indicates insufficient outside leg pressure

### Error: Neglecting upper body control and grips
- **Consequence**: Legs alone provide off-balancing but upper body control is necessary to direct the sweep and prevent opponent from posting or escaping
- **Correction**: Use hands to control the trapped leg, ankle, or heel. Upper body control completes the sweeping system
- **Recognition**: Opponent successfully posts their hands or escapes despite good leg position indicates missing upper body control

### Error: Staying in SLX too long without transitioning
- **Consequence**: SLX is inherently transitional - staying too long allows opponent to develop counters and escape routes. The position's power is in its dynamic application
- **Correction**: Use SLX as an entry point to sweeps, leg locks, X-Guard, or technical standups. Maximum time in position should be 5-10 seconds before committing to an action
- **Recognition**: Finding yourself stuck in SLX without clear offensive path indicates you're being too passive

## Training Drills

### Drill 1: SLX Entry and Sweep Combinations
Partner stands in front of your open guard. Practice entering SLX from various positions (butterfly, seated guard, failed takedown) and immediately executing a sweep. Partner provides progressive resistance from 25% to 75%. Focus on seamless entry to sweep transition with emphasis on off-balancing mechanics. 10 repetitions per entry variation, 3 sets. This drill develops the fundamental entry and sweeping mechanics.

### Drill 2: SLX Balance Breaking
Starting in established SLX position, partner attempts to maintain balance while you work constant off-balancing pressure using push-pull dynamics. Partner is not allowed to post hands for first minute, then adds hand posts for second minute. Focus on the coordination of inside leg pull and outside leg push to break balance. 2-minute rounds, 5 repetitions. Develops the feeling of proper off-balancing mechanics.

### Drill 3: SLX to Multiple Positions Flow
Partner provides 50% resistance as you flow: SLX → sweep → reset → SLX → X-Guard → reset → SLX → Ashi Garami → reset → SLX → technical standup. The goal is smooth transitions and maintaining control throughout transitions. 5-minute continuous flow, switching roles every minute. This drill builds the transitional understanding of SLX as a hub position.
