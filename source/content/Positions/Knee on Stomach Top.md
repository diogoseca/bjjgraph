## State Description

Knee on Stomach (Knee on Belly, Knee Ride) is a dominant top control position where you place your knee directly on your opponent's abdomen or sternum while maintaining base and balance through your other leg. This position scores 2 points in IBJJF competition and provides excellent control while maintaining high mobility for transitions. The position creates significant discomfort for the opponent through concentrated pressure, often forcing reactions that create submission or positional advancement opportunities.

Knee on Stomach balances control and mobility - you maintain dominant positioning while being able to quickly transition to mount, side control, or submission attacks. The position is particularly effective for creating reactions because the pressure is uncomfortable enough to prompt defensive movements, yet mobile enough to capitalize on those reactions instantly.

From a strategic perspective, Knee on Stomach serves as a central hub position from which numerous attacks and transitions are available. Elite practitioners use it to create dilemmas where opponent's defensive choices all lead to offensive opportunities - shrimping away opens armlocks, bridging enables mount transitions, turning away exposes the back.

### Visual Description

You are perpendicular to your opponent with one knee planted firmly on their abdomen or lower chest, creating significant downward pressure through your body weight. Your other leg is posted out wide for base, typically with foot near their hip or thigh for stability and balance. Your hands control their gi (lapel and sleeve typically) or establish frames on their body in no-gi, preventing escaping while maintaining your balance. Your body is upright with weight distributed through your knee and posted foot, creating mobile but stable configuration.

The pressure point is concentrated on your knee, which digs into opponent's abdomen creating discomfort that prompts defensive reactions. Your head is up maintaining visual awareness, body positioned to flow with opponent's escape attempts while maintaining pressure. The spatial relationship is highly mobile - you can quickly shift weight, change knee position, or transition to other positions while maintaining control of opponent's movement.

## Key Principles

- **Concentrated pressure creates reactions** - Knee pressure on abdomen forces opponent to defend, creating predictable movement patterns
- **Mobile base enables transitions** - Posted foot and upright posture allow quick position changes
- **Grip control limits escapes** - Controlling gi or body prevents opponent from creating effective frames
- **Weight distribution through knee** - Transfer body weight through knee for maximum pressure with minimum effort
- **Timing transitions with reactions** - Flow with opponent's defensive movements to advance position
- **Maintain balance despite opponent movement** - Adjust base continuously as opponent attempts escapes

## Expert Insights

**John Danaher**: Views Knee on Stomach as transitional control position rather than destination - its value lies in mobility enabling quick reactions to opponent's defensive choices. Emphasizes using pressure to create predictable responses: shrimping opens armlocks, bridging enables mount, turning away exposes back. Teaches systematic approach where knee placement, base positioning, and grip configuration all optimize for specific transition opportunities. Key principle is maintaining pressure while staying light on feet, ready to flow with opponent's movement rather than fighting against it.

**Gordon Ryan**: Uses Knee on Stomach as pressure testing position in competition to force opponents into defensive actions that reveal their preferred escape patterns. Then exploits those patterns with prepared counters. Emphasizes switching knee positions rapidly to prevent opponent from establishing effective hip escapes, keeping them constantly defending rather than executing. Competition strategy involves using Knee on Stomach to burn opponent's energy through sustained pressure while conserving own energy through efficient weight distribution. When opponent is exhausted, transitions become significantly easier.

**Eddie Bravo**: Incorporates Knee on Stomach into 10th Planet system as entry point to Twister Side Control and other unique positions. Focuses on using knee pressure to set up unconventional attacks including electric chair setups and truck transitions. Views position as opportunity to create unusual angles and positions that opponents haven't prepared defenses for. Emphasizes maintaining constant pressure while looking for creative transition opportunities rather than following traditional attack patterns.

## Common Errors

### Error: Poor Base Positioning
- **Consequence**: Unstable balance allows opponent to bridge or sweep you off position, losing control entirely
- **Correction**: Post far leg wide with foot near opponent's hip, maintain upright posture, adjust base continuously as opponent moves
- **Recognition**: If opponent easily rocks you off balance or sweeps you, base is insufficient

### Error: Weight on Opponent's Chest Instead of Knee
- **Consequence**: Distributing weight through hands or chest reduces pressure, makes position less effective, easier to escape
- **Correction**: Channel weight through knee into opponent's abdomen, keep upper body upright, use hands for control not weight distribution
- **Recognition**: If opponent seems comfortable or position feels heavy to maintain, weight distribution is incorrect

### Error: Static Knee Placement
- **Consequence**: Allows opponent to time escape attempts and establish effective hip escapes once they adapt to pressure point
- **Correction**: Switch knee positions (high, low, diagonal) to prevent opponent from establishing consistent escape rhythm
- **Recognition**: If opponent repeatedly executes same escape, knee placement is too predictable

### Error: Poor Grip Control
- **Consequence**: Opponent creates frames, pushes knee away, or generates space for escape without significant resistance
- **Correction**: Control opponent's gi (lapel and sleeve) or establish frames on their body, prevent them from posting hands or creating barriers
- **Recognition**: If opponent consistently posts hands or creates frames, grip control needs improvement

### Error: Committing Weight During Transitions
- **Consequence**: Getting caught between positions during transitions, losing balance, or allowing opponent to escape during movement
- **Correction**: Maintain balance and pressure throughout transitions, don't commit full weight until new position is secure
- **Recognition**: If opponent escapes during your transitions, you're committing too early

## Training Drills

### Drill 1: Knee on Stomach Retention Against Escapes
Partner uses specific escape techniques (elbow-knee, bridge, hip escape) at 50-75% intensity while you maintain position through base adjustment and pressure. 2-minute rounds, goal is position retention. Develops reactive base adjustments and pressure maintenance under escape attempts. Progress to 100% escape intensity as skill improves.

### Drill 2: Transition Cycles from Knee on Stomach
Flow through transition sequence: Knee on Stomach → Mount → Side Control → North-South → Knee on Stomach. Partner provides positional resistance but doesn't attempt escapes. Perform 5-8 complete cycles per 3-minute round. Builds transitional fluidity and position retention during movement.

### Drill 3: Submission Setups from Pressure Reactions
Establish Knee on Stomach, apply pressure to elicit specific reactions, immediately transition to appropriate submission. Partner provides realistic reactions. Practice: shrimp reaction → armbar, bridge reaction → mount, turn away → back take. Develops reaction reading and exploitation timing.

### Drill 4: Knee Switch Speed Drill
Rapidly switch knee positions (high chest, mid abdomen, low abdomen, diagonal) while maintaining balance and pressure. Partner stays flat initially, then provides increasing resistance. 1-minute intense rounds with 30-second rest. Builds knee mobility and balance control.

### Drill 5: Live Positional Sparring
Start in Knee on Stomach, 3-minute rounds. Top player: maintain or improve position, hunt submissions. Bottom player: escape to guard or better. Full resistance. Integrates all elements in realistic context.

## Related Positions

- [[Mount Top]] - Natural progression from knee on stomach via step-over
- [[Side Control Top]] - Alternative control position, more stable less mobile
- [[North-South Top]] - Transition option when opponent creates distance
- [[Back Control Top]] - Available when opponent turns away from pressure
- [[Scarf Hold Top]] - Alternative pressure position with different control mechanism

## Optimal Submission Paths

**Fastest path** (armlock focus):
[[Knee on Stomach Top]] → [[Armbar from Knee on Stomach]] → [[Armbar Control]] → [[Won by Submission]]
*Reasoning: Opponent's shrimping reaction naturally opens arm isolation for armbar, fastest submission from position*

**High-percentage path** (positional advancement):
[[Knee on Stomach Top]] → [[Step Over to Mount]] → [[High Mount]] → [[Mounted Armbar]] → [[Won by Submission]]
*Reasoning: Mount provides more secure control before submission attempt, higher finishing percentage*

**Back attack path** (opponent turns away):
[[Knee on Stomach Top]] → [[Back Take]] → [[Back Control Top]] → [[Rear Naked Choke]] → [[Won by Submission]]
*Reasoning: Opponent turning away from pressure exposes back, creates highest percentage submission position*

**Alternative path** (gi choke):
[[Knee on Stomach Top]] → [[Baseball Bat Choke Setup]] → [[Baseball Bat Choke]] → [[Won by Submission]]
*Reasoning: Gi-specific option available when armlocks are defended, catches opponents focusing on preventing mount*

## Timing Considerations

**Best Times to Enter**:
- After successfully passing guard when opponent is flat
- When transitioning from side control to create different pressure angle
- After opponent defends mount attempt, stepping back to knee on stomach
- During scrambles when opponent is recovering to side

**Best Times to Attack**:
- When opponent makes defensive commitment (shrimp, bridge, turn)
- When opponent is fatigued and defensive reactions slow
- After establishing consistent pressure that creates discomfort
- When opponent attempts to sit up or create distance

**Vulnerable Moments**:
- During initial establishment before base is secure
- When switching knee positions if timing is poor
- During transitions if balance is compromised
- If opponent successfully establishes strong elbow-knee frame

**Fatigue Factors**:
- Maintaining balance requires constant quad and core engagement
- Sustained upright posture causes lower back and hip fatigue
- Frequent transitions drain more energy than static hold
- Opponent experiences significant respiratory stress from pressure

## Competition Considerations

**Point Scoring**: Scores 2 points in IBJJF once established with clear control (knee on abdomen/chest, balance maintained, opponent unable to escape). Must maintain for 3 seconds to score.

**Time Management**: Energy efficient position for time control once established. Can maintain pressure while conserving energy compared to active submissions. Good position for protecting lead in competition.

**Rule Set Adaptations**:
- IBJJF: Focus on scoring 2 points quickly then transitioning to mount for additional points
- ADCC: Less emphasis on point scoring, use as submission setup or control position
- Submission-only: Purely transitional position to hunt finishes

**Competition Strategy**: Knee on Stomach excellent for controlling match pace, creating pressure that forces reactions, and maintaining dominant positioning with escape options if needed. High-level competitors use it to study opponent's defensive patterns before committing to specific attacks.

## Safety Considerations

- Apply pressure progressively, especially with training partners significantly smaller
- Monitor partner's breathing - excessive pressure can cause respiratory distress
- Be aware of rib and sternum sensitivity - adjust knee placement if partner shows pain
- During training, maintain communication about pressure comfort level
- Release pressure if partner shows signs of distress beyond normal discomfort

## Historical Context

Knee on Stomach has been fundamental to Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu since its earliest development, with Gracie family emphasizing pressure-based control positions. The position gained prominence through competitors like Marcelo Garcia, who used it as central hub for his submission game. Modern evolution includes more mobile, transition-focused applications as seen in Gordon Ryan's competition style, moving away from purely static pressure holding toward dynamic transitional use.
