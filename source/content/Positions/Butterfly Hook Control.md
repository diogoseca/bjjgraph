# Butterfly Hook Control
#bjj #state #guard #bottom #butterfly

## State Properties
- **State ID**: S242
- **Point Value**: 0 (Neutral position)
- **Position Type**: Offensive guard position
- **Risk Level**: Medium
- **Energy Cost**: Medium
- **Time Sustainability**: Medium

## State Description
Butterfly Hook Control is a dynamic open guard position where the bottom player sits up with their feet positioned inside the opponent's thighs, creating hooks that enable powerful elevation and sweeping mechanics. This position excels at off-balancing opponents who maintain forward pressure and close range, making it a fundamental position for both gi and no-gi grappling.

The butterfly guard is characterized by active, elevating hooks that constantly threaten sweeps and back takes. Unlike closed guard, the bottom player maintains a more upright seated posture, allowing for greater mobility and angle creation. The position requires strong core engagement and timing to capitalize on the opponent's movements and weight distribution.

This guard works best against opponents on their knees with forward pressure, as the hooks can effectively redirect their momentum. It's less effective against standing opponents who can create distance or those who flatten the guard player out. The position offers excellent opportunities for both sweeping to top position and transitioning to back control when opponents defend sweeps by posting.

## Visual Description
You are seated on the mat with your hips slightly elevated, knees bent and spread wide to create space between your legs. Your feet are positioned inside your opponent's thighs, with your toes pointed toward their hips and the tops of your feet or insteps pressing against the inner part of their legs to create upward pressure. Your opponent is on their knees facing you, with their weight distributed forward as they attempt to pass or control your upper body.

Your upper body is upright and active, with your hands controlling their collar, sleeves, or establishing underhooks and overhooks to break their posture and create off-balancing opportunities. Your core is engaged to maintain your seated position while your hooks actively lift and elevate, keeping constant pressure that forces them to react. The spatial relationship between you is close and dynamic, with your hooks acting as levers that can redirect their forward momentum into sweeps or create space for transitions to back control when they post to defend.

This configuration allows you to threaten multiple sweep directions while maintaining defensive security through your active hooks and upper body control. The hooks serve both offensive purposes (elevation for sweeps) and defensive purposes (preventing opponent from flattening you or establishing heavy pressure).

## Key Principles
- **Active Hook Elevation**: Constantly pressure upward with hooks to off-balance and prevent opponent from settling weight
- **Upper Body Connection**: Maintain strong grips or underhooks to break posture and control opponent's shoulder line
- **Core Engagement**: Strong seated posture prevents opponent from flattening you and enables explosive sweep execution
- **Momentum Redirection**: Use opponent's forward pressure against them by elevating and sweeping in direction of their movement
- **Angle Creation**: Shift hips side to side to create angles for sweeps and prevent straight-on passing pressure
- **Transition Readiness**: Be prepared to transition to back takes when opponent posts out to defend sweeps

## Prerequisites
- Strong core strength for maintaining seated posture
- Hip flexibility for deep hook insertion
- Understanding of leverage and momentum redirection
- Basic grip fighting and upper body control

## State Invariants
- Feet positioned inside opponent's thighs with hooks established
- Seated position with hips elevated off mat

## Expert Insights

**John Danaher**: The butterfly guard is fundamentally about creating a mechanical advantage through elevation. The hooks must be viewed not as passive controls but as active levers that constantly apply upward pressure, disrupting the opponent's base and creating a perpetual state of imbalance. The key is understanding that every defense to your sweep creates an opportunity for either a different sweep direction or a back take - this is the systematic approach that makes butterfly guard such a dominant position.

**Gordon Ryan**: In competition, I use butterfly guard primarily as a transitional position to either sweep or take the back. The critical element is maintaining aggressive forward pressure with your upper body while your hooks create the actual sweeping mechanism. Most people make the mistake of being too passive in butterfly - you need to be constantly elevating, shifting angles, and forcing reactions. When they base out to stop your sweep, that's when you immediately transition to the back or switch to a different guard.

**Eddie Bravo**: The butterfly guard becomes exponentially more powerful when you incorporate unconventional gripping strategies and transitions to other guard systems. From butterfly, I'm looking to create confusion by mixing in deep half entries, leg locks, and even inverting under for back takes. The traditional butterfly sweep is great, but being unpredictable with your attacks and transitions makes the position far more threatening. Don't get stuck in just doing basic sweeps - use the butterfly hooks as a launching pad for creative attacks.

## Common Errors

### Error: Keeping hooks too shallow
- **Consequence**: Allows opponent to easily step over your hooks and pass your guard, negating all sweeping power and defensive security.
- **Correction**: Insert hooks deep between opponent's legs, with your toes pointing toward their hips and the tops of your feet making solid contact with the inner thighs. The deeper the hooks, the more control and leverage you have.
- **Recognition**: If opponent can easily remove your hooks or step over them, your hooks are too shallow.

### Error: Passive, flat posture
- **Consequence**: Opponent can establish heavy pressure from above, flatten you out, and easily pass your guard as you lose all offensive capability.
- **Correction**: Maintain an active, upright seated posture with your core engaged. Keep your head and shoulders forward, constantly threatening with upper body control and hook elevation.
- **Recognition**: If you find yourself lying back with shoulders on the mat, you've lost your butterfly guard structure.

### Error: Static hooks without elevation
- **Consequence**: Hooks become just passive barriers rather than active sweeping tools, allowing opponent to settle their weight and establish dominant passing position.
- **Correction**: Constantly elevate with your hooks, creating upward pressure that keeps opponent off-balance and reactive. Your hooks should be actively lifting, not just resting.
- **Recognition**: If opponent feels stable and comfortable on top of your hooks, you're not creating enough active pressure.

### Error: Poor upper body connection
- **Consequence**: Unable to break opponent's posture or control their shoulder line, making it impossible to create the off-balance needed for successful sweeps.
- **Correction**: Establish strong grips on collar and sleeves, or secure underhooks and overhooks to break posture forward. Your upper body grips should pull opponent toward you while hooks elevate.
- **Recognition**: If opponent can maintain upright posture while you have hooks in, you lack proper upper body control.

### Error: Not transitioning when opponent posts
- **Consequence**: Missed opportunities for back takes or alternative sweeps when opponent creates openings by posting their hands to defend your initial sweep.
- **Correction**: When opponent posts their hand out to stop your sweep, immediately transition to taking their back or switching to a different sweep angle. Their defensive post creates the opening.
- **Recognition**: If opponent consistently defends your sweeps by posting and you return to neutral, you're missing transition opportunities.

### Error: Fighting against standing opponents
- **Consequence**: Butterfly hooks are ineffective against standing opponents who can create distance and control from above, leading to easy guard passes.
- **Correction**: When opponent stands up, immediately transition to a standing-friendly guard like De La Riva, X-Guard, or Single Leg X. Don't maintain butterfly hooks against standing opponents.
- **Recognition**: If you're trying to sweep someone who is standing tall above you with butterfly hooks, you're in the wrong guard for the situation.

### Error: Equal hook pressure on both sides
- **Consequence**: Creates a balanced position where neither sweep direction has advantage, telegraphing your intentions and making sweeps predictable.
- **Correction**: Commit more pressure to one hook while using the other for balance and adjustment. The primary sweeping hook should have significantly more elevation pressure.
- **Recognition**: If your sweeps lack power and direction, you may be splitting your force equally between both hooks.

## Training Drills

### Drill 1: Hook Elevation and Maintenance
Partner starts on knees in your butterfly guard. Begin with zero resistance - practice elevating your hooks and maintaining constant upward pressure. Progress through 25% resistance (partner tries to flatten your hooks), 50% resistance (partner actively pushes down), 75% resistance (partner uses weight and pressure), and finally 100% resistance (full defense). Focus on keeping hooks deep, maintaining seated posture, and never letting opponent flatten you completely. Work 3-minute rounds with 1-minute rest. Goal is to maintain active hooks for entire duration regardless of pressure.

### Drill 2: Sweep Execution from Hooks
Start in butterfly guard with partner providing 50% resistance. Execute 5 butterfly sweeps to one side, then 5 to the other side, focusing on explosive hip extension, proper hook elevation, and upper body pull coordination. Rest 1 minute. Repeat for 5 rounds. Gradually increase resistance each week. Common mistakes to watch: sweeping with arms only (use whole body), not committing to one direction (half-hearted sweeps fail), failing to follow through to top position. Sets: 5 rounds of 10 sweeps (5 each side).

### Drill 3: Back Take Recognition and Execution
Partner in your butterfly guard attempts to defend your sweeps by posting their hand out to the side. As soon as they post, immediately transition to taking their back - climb up their posted arm, get one hook in, and secure back control. Start at 25% resistance and progress to 75%. Focus on explosive reaction to the post, not hesitating, and completing the back take transition smoothly. Partner should alternate which side they post on. Work for 5-minute rounds, attempting 10-15 back takes per round.

### Drill 4: Guard Retention and Recovery
Partner actively tries to flatten you out and pass your butterfly guard at 75% intensity. Your job is to maintain hooks, recover seated posture when flattened, and return to active butterfly position. Focus on hip movement, hook replacement, and using frames to create space for re-establishing hooks. If hooks are removed, immediately transition to another guard then flow back to butterfly. Work 3-minute rounds with 1-minute rest for 5 rounds. This develops the defensive security of the position.

### Drill 5: Flow Between Guards
Start in butterfly guard, then flow to: Single Leg X → Back to butterfly → X-Guard → Back to butterfly → Deep Half → Back to butterfly. Partner provides moderate resistance and occasional passing attempts. This develops the transitional nature of butterfly and your ability to use it as a hub position. Work 5-minute rounds continuously flowing between positions. Focus on smooth transitions, maintaining hook control during transitions, and returning to butterfly as your home base.

## Decision Tree

**If** opponent maintains heavy forward pressure with low posture:
- Execute [[Butterfly Sweep]] → [[Mount]] (Probability: 60%)
  - Reasoning: Forward pressure loads their weight onto your hooks, making elevation more effective
- Or Execute [[Elevator Sweep]] → [[Mount]] (Probability: 55%)
  - Reasoning: Low posture allows you to get under their center of gravity for maximum leverage

**Else if** opponent posts hand to defend sweep:
- Execute [[Arm Drag to Back]] → [[Back Control]] (Probability: 55%)
  - Reasoning: Posted hand creates opening for back take and removes their defensive frame
- Or Execute [[Hook Sweep]] to opposite side → [[Side Control Top]] (Probability: 50%)
  - Reasoning: Weight shift from posting creates opportunity to sweep in opposite direction

**Else if** opponent stands up to create distance:
- Transition to [[Single Leg X Transition]] → [[Single Leg X Guard]] (Probability: 65%)
  - Reasoning: Standing position requires guard adaptation to maintain control
- Or Execute [[X-Guard Transition]] → [[X-Guard]] (Probability: 60%)
  - Reasoning: Standing opponent provides structure needed for X-Guard mechanics

**Else if** opponent attempts to flatten you out:
- Execute [[Sit-up Sweep]] → [[Mount]] (Probability: 50%)
  - Reasoning: Their forward pressure to flatten provides momentum for sit-up sweep
- Or Transition to [[Deep Half Entry]] → [[Deep Half Guard]] (Probability: 45%)
  - Reasoning: When flattened, deep half offers recovery option with continued offensive potential

**Else** (opponent maintains distance with good posture):
- Establish [[Guillotine Setup]] → [[Guillotine Control]] (Probability: 40%)
  - Reasoning: Distance and posture provide opening for guillotine attack when they lean forward
- Or Execute standard [[Butterfly Sweep]] → [[Mount]] (Probability: 45%)
  - Reasoning: Create off-balance through combination of hook elevation and upper body control

## Position Metrics
- **Position Retention Rate**: Beginner 40%, Intermediate 55%, Advanced 70%
- **Advancement Probability**: Beginner 35%, Intermediate 50%, Advanced 65%
- **Submission Probability**: Beginner 15%, Intermediate 25%, Advanced 40%
- **Position Loss Probability**: Beginner 45%, Intermediate 30%, Advanced 20%
- **Average Time in Position**: 1-2 minutes

## Optimal Submission Paths

**Fastest path to sweep (most common goal):**
[[Butterfly Hook Control]] → [[Butterfly Sweep]] → [[Mount]] → [[Submission Chain]] → [[Won by Submission]]
*Reasoning: Direct sweep to dominant mount position provides quickest path to submissions. High percentage and most direct route.*

**High-percentage back take path:**
[[Butterfly Hook Control]] → [[Arm Drag to Back]] (when opponent posts) → [[Back Control]] → [[Rear Naked Choke]] → [[Won by Submission]]
*Reasoning: Back takes from butterfly are extremely high percentage when opponent defends sweeps. Back control has highest submission rate.*

**Direct submission path:**
[[Butterfly Hook Control]] → [[Guillotine Setup]] → [[Guillotine Control]] → [[Won by Submission]]
*Reasoning: When opponent reaches forward with poor posture, guillotine presents itself as direct submission without needing to sweep first.*

**Systematic progression path:**
[[Butterfly Hook Control]] → [[Single Leg X Transition]] → [[Single Leg X Guard]] → [[Sweep]] → [[Top Position]] → [[Submission Chain]] → [[Won by Submission]]
*Reasoning: Danaher-style systematic approach, transitioning to single leg X for more controlled sweep before attacking from top.*

**Alternative guard transition path:**
[[Butterfly Hook Control]] → [[Deep Half Entry]] → [[Deep Half Guard]] → [[Homer Simpson Sweep]] → [[Top Position]] → [[Submission Chain]] → [[Won by Submission]]
*Reasoning: When butterfly is defended, deep half provides alternative attack vector with different mechanical advantages.*
