# Outside Ashi Garami Bottom
#bjj #state #leglock #bottom #advanced

## State Properties
- **State ID**: S075
- **Point Value**: 0 (Neutral position in most rule sets)
- **Position Type**: Offensive leg entanglement
- **Risk Level**: Medium to High
- **Energy Cost**: Medium
- **Time Sustainability**: Medium

## State Description

Outside Ashi Garami Bottom is a leg entanglement position where you control your opponent's right leg from the outside while on your back or side, with your legs creating a figure-4 configuration that isolates and controls their leg. This position is foundational in modern leg lock systems, particularly in no-gi and submission-only formats, offering multiple heel hook and ankle lock opportunities.

The position is characterized by your outside leg (left leg) crossing over their thigh while your inside leg (right leg) triangles underneath their knee, creating a locked configuration. Your upper body is typically perpendicular or angled to your opponent, with grips controlling their leg and preventing their hip rotation.

From this position, the practitioner has access to outside heel hooks, straight ankle locks, and transitions to more dominant leg entanglements. The position represents a neutral starting point in the leg entanglement game where both practitioners are working to improve their position or finish submissions.

### Visual Description

You are on your back or left side, with your opponent's right leg trapped between your legs in a figure-4 configuration. Your left leg crosses over the top of their right thigh, while your right leg triangles underneath their right knee, with your right foot hooking behind your left knee or ankle. Your hips are angled perpendicular or diagonal to your opponent (approximately 45-90 degrees), facing toward their trapped leg. Your upper body controls their leg with both hands - typically one hand gripping their heel or foot (for heel hook control), and the other hand controlling their knee or thigh (preventing hip rotation and escape). Your opponent is either seated, on their hip, or attempting to stand, with their right leg trapped and their left leg free. The position creates a lever system where your legs clamp their leg in place while your upper body applies rotational or hyperextension force to the ankle/heel.

## Key Principles

- **Leg triangle must be tight** - No space between your legs and opponent's leg
- **Hip angle is critical** - Perpendicular or diagonal angle creates optimal leverage
- **Control opponent's hip rotation** - Prevent them from turning knee outward (externally rotating)
- **Upper body grips dictate attacks** - Heel control enables heel hooks, ankle control enables ankle locks
- **Active legs create control** - Squeeze and adjust leg configuration constantly
- **Threaten submissions to prevent escapes** - Submission pressure keeps opponent defensive

## Prerequisites

- Understanding of leg entanglement mechanics and risks
- Knowledge of heel hook anatomy and safety protocols
- Experience with inside ashi garami or basic leg lock positions
- Training in leg lock-legal environments (no-gi, submission-only, ADCC rules)

## State Invariants

- Your legs form figure-4 around opponent's leg (left leg over thigh, right leg under knee)
- Hip angle maintained (perpendicular or diagonal to opponent)
- Opponent's trapped leg controlled and isolated
- Upper body controlling opponent's leg with grips

## Expert Insights

**Danaher System**: Outside ashi garami is the entry point of Danaher's leg lock system, teaching fundamental concepts of hip control, leg configuration, and submission mechanics. Emphasizes that outside ashi should be viewed as a transitional position toward more dominant configurations like saddle or cross ashi, not a finishing position. Focus is on using outside heel hook threat to create reactions, then transitioning to higher-percentage positions. The "legs follow the hips" principle - control opponent's hip rotation first, legs will follow.

**Gordon Ryan**: Uses outside ashi as an aggressive entry position in competition, particularly after leg drag or guard pull scenarios. Ryan's approach emphasizes immediate submission threats (outside heel hook, ankle lock) to keep opponent defensive while working toward saddle position. Competition footage shows his preference for transitioning quickly through outside ashi rather than attempting to finish from it, using it as a gateway to more dominant leg entanglements.

**Eddie Bravo**: While 10th Planet system focuses heavily on rubber guard and back control, Bravo has integrated leg lock positions from modern no-gi developments. Teaches outside ashi as part of leg lock entries from failed lockdown or half guard scenarios. Emphasizes safety awareness and knowing competition rule sets (many 10th Planet tournaments restrict heel hooks), so practitioners must understand when to use leg locks vs. traditional attacks.

## Common Errors

- **Error**: Loose leg triangle with space
  - **Consequence**: Opponent can extract their leg or rotate hip to escape, position becomes unstable
  - **Correction**: Squeeze legs together tightly, right foot pulled back toward buttocks to tighten figure-4, eliminate all space
- **Error**: Flat body position (not angled)
  - **Consequence**: Reduces leverage for submissions, makes it easier for opponent to stack or pass
  - **Correction**: Angle body 45-90 degrees perpendicular to opponent, hip toward their trapped leg
- **Error**: Weak upper body grips
  - **Consequence**: Opponent rotates hip out, extracts leg, or counterattacks with top leg lock position
  - **Correction**: Strong two-handed control - one hand on heel/foot, other hand on knee/thigh to block rotation
- **Error**: Staying static in outside ashi
  - **Consequence**: Opponent has time to establish standing posture or work escape, position becomes stalemate
  - **Correction**: Constantly threaten submissions and transitions, use opponent's defensive reactions to advance position
- **Error**: Ignoring opponent's free leg
  - **Consequence**: Opponent uses free leg to kick, push, or establish frames that aid escape
  - **Correction**: Monitor free leg, use grips and body positioning to control or neutralize free leg's effectiveness

## Training Drills

- **Leg Configuration Isolation**: Partner's leg is stationary, practice establishing tight figure-4 from various starting positions, focus on eliminating space and achieving proper angle, 10 reps each side
- **Hip Control Maintenance**: Partner attempts to rotate hip externally (turning knee outward) with 25%, 50%, 75% resistance, practice blocking rotation with hand grips and body position, develop sensitivity to hip movement
- **Submission Threat Flow**: From established outside ashi, flow between outside heel hook and straight ankle lock setups (no finish pressure in training), partner stationary then slowly moving, build pattern recognition for which submission is available based on leg position
- **Transition Drilling**: Practice transitioning from outside ashi to saddle, cross ashi, and inside ashi in sequence, partner provides progressive resistance (25% → 50% → 75%), develop smooth transition mechanics
- **Position Sparring**: 5-minute rounds starting in outside ashi garami, you work submissions and advances, partner works escapes and counters, full resistance, develop live timing and decision-making

## Optimal Submission Paths

**Fastest path to submission** (direct attack):
[[Outside Ashi Garami Bottom]] → [[Outside Heel Hook]] → [[Won by Submission]]
*Reasoning: Direct submission from position if opponent's defense is poor*

**High-percentage path** (systematic):
[[Outside Ashi Garami Bottom]] → [[Saddle Position Bottom]] → [[Inside Heel Hook]] → [[Won by Submission]]
*Reasoning: Transition to more dominant entanglement with higher finishing rate*

**Alternative submission path** (standing counter):
[[Outside Ashi Garami Bottom]] → [[Straight Ankle Lock]] → [[Won by Submission]]
*Reasoning: When opponent stands, ankle lock becomes highly effective*

**System-based path** (Danaher approach):
[[Outside Ashi Garami Bottom]] → [[Cross Ashi Garami Bottom]] → [[Saddle Position Bottom]] → [[Inside Heel Hook]] → [[Won by Submission]]
*Reasoning: Systematic progression through entanglement hierarchy to most dominant position*
