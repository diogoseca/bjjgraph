- **Alternative Names**: Technical Stand-up from Turtle, Turtle Escape to Feet, Granby to Standing

### State Machine Properties
- **Starting State**: [[Turtle Position Bottom]]
- **Ending State**: [[Standing Position]], [[Neutral Position]]
- **Transition Type**: Escape - defensive recovery to standing

### Transition Properties
- **Success Probability**: Beginner 50%, Intermediate 70%, Advanced 85%
- **Execution Complexity**: Medium - requires explosive power and timing
- **Energy Cost**: Medium - significant burst required
- **Time Required**: Quick - 2-3 seconds for execution
- **Risk Level**: Medium - can be countered with submissions or takedowns

### Physical Requirements

- **Coordination Requirements**: High for explosive multi-step sequence
- **Speed Requirements**: High for executing before opponent adjusts weight

## State Machine Content Elements

### Visual Execution Sequence
From defensive turtle position with opponent on top applying pressure, you maintain strong base with head up protecting your neck. You post your far hand flat on the mat creating a stable base point. Your near-side foot steps forward flat on the mat, creating a strong post. Driving explosively off your posted foot and hand, you stand up quickly while opponent tries to maintain control. You strip or clear any remaining grips and turn to face opponent. You establish proper standing defensive posture with appropriate distance, successfully escaping turtle to standing position.

**Template**: "From defensive turtle with strong base, post far hand on mat, step near foot forward flat, drive explosively to stand using posted points, clear grips while rising, and establish standing defensive posture with proper distance."

### Execution Steps (Numbered Sequence)
1. **Establish Base**: Maintain strong defensive turtle with head up, knees under hips, arms protecting neck and controlling space
2. **Post Far Hand**: Post your far hand flat on mat away from opponent for stable base and leverage point
3. **Drive Near Leg**: Step your near-side foot forward flat on mat, creating strong posting point for explosion
4. **Stand Explosively**: Drive off posted foot and hand simultaneously to stand up quickly and explosively
5. **Clear Grips**: Strip opponent's grips on your hips, legs, or upper body while standing, or turn into them
6. **Establish Stance**: Achieve standing position with proper wrestling stance, hands up, maintaining safe distance

### Key Technical Details
Critical elements that determine success:
- **Grip Requirements**: Initially protecting neck, then grip clearing during stand-up
- **Base/Foundation**: Posted hand and foot create stable launching points for explosion
- **Timing Windows**: Execute when opponent's weight is high or during position adjustment
- **Leverage Points**: Posted hand and foot provide leverage for explosive standing motion
- **Common Adjustments**: Adjust posting direction based on opponent's pressure and position

### Success Modifiers
Factors that increase/decrease probability:
- **Setup Quality**: Base strength and posting positions (+/-15%)
- **Timing Precision**: Standing when opponent's weight is high or transitioning (+/-15%)
- **Opponent Fatigue**: Reduced grip strength and reaction speed (+/-5%)
- **Knowledge Test Performance**: Understanding stand-up mechanics and timing (+/-10%)
- **Position Control**: Quality of initial turtle base and explosiveness (+/-5%)

## Counter-Attack Analysis

### Common Counters
Opponent responses with success rates:
- **Weight Drop**: Dropping weight to prevent stand-up → [[Turtle Position Top]] (Success Rate: 45%, Conditions: quick reaction)
- **Back Take**: Following stand-up and securing back → [[Back Control]] (Success Rate: 40%, Conditions: maintaining grips)
- **Takedown**: Attacking legs during stand-up attempt → [[Takedown]] (Success Rate: 35%, Conditions: timing and grip)
- **Front Headlock**: Controlling head during stand-up → [[Front Headlock]] (Success Rate: 40%, Conditions: head control)

Format: `[[Counter Technique]] → [[Result State]] (Success Rate: X%, Conditions: [when applicable])`

### Decision Logic
```
If [stand-up detected early]:
- Execute [[Weight Drop]] (Probability: 45%)

Else if [grips maintained during stand]:
- Execute [[Back Take]] (Probability: 40%)

Else if [legs exposed during stand]:
- Execute [[Takedown]] (Probability: 35%)

Else [standing achieved]:
- Accept transition (Probability: Success Rate - Modifiers)
```

## Educational Content

### Expert Insights
Commentary as if from recognized authorities:
- **John Danaher**: "The turtle to standing escape is a high-level defensive skill that requires explosive power combined with proper technical sequencing. The critical element is creating two stable posting points - the far hand and near foot - that can support an explosive upward drive. You must time this when opponent's weight is high on your back, not when they have deep hooks with weight low. The explosive drive must be immediate once your posts are established - hesitation allows them to drop weight and prevent the stand-up. Strip grips aggressively as you rise, and turn to face them immediately upon standing to prevent back exposure."
- **Gordon Ryan**: "Standing up from turtle is my preferred escape when I can't immediately recover guard, especially in no-gi where grips are less secure. The key is explosive timing - you want to stand when they're adjusting position or their weight is high. I focus on making my posts strong and driving through them powerfully. The grip stripping during the stand-up is critical - you can't allow them to maintain control as you rise or they'll take your back. Once I'm standing, I immediately establish distance and wrestling posture. It's a high-success escape if you commit fully to the explosion."
- **Eddie Bravo**: "We teach standing from turtle as part of our defensive system because it's often the best option when guard recovery isn't available. The wrestling influence here is obvious - it's a technical stand-up adapted for BJJ. The key is being comfortable with that explosive burst motion and not hesitating. You post, you drive, you stand - one smooth motion. We drill this constantly so our guys can hit it instinctively under pressure. It's especially useful in competition where staying in turtle too long can lead to penalties or back points. Stand up, reset, continue fighting."

Each insight should focus on one key technical or strategic element.

### Common Errors
For knowledge test generation:
- **Error**: Posting hand too close to body
- **Why It Fails**: Insufficient leverage for explosive drive, easy for opponent to collapse
- **Correction**: Post hand far from body creating wide base and maximum leverage
- **Recognition**: Unable to generate explosive power during stand-up attempt

- **Error**: Not stepping foot forward before attempting to stand
- **Why It Fails**: Single posting point insufficient for explosive standing motion
- **Correction**: Step near foot forward flat before driving, creating two strong posts
- **Recognition**: Stand-up feels weak or unbalanced

- **Error**: Attempting to stand when opponent has heavy low weight and deep hooks
- **Why It Fails**: Opponent's weight and hooks prevent upward motion
- **Correction**: Wait for moment when opponent's weight is high or transitioning
- **Recognition**: Complete inability to stand despite full effort

- **Error**: Slow or hesitant standing motion
- **Why It Fails**: Gives opponent time to drop weight or secure better control
- **Correction**: Explosive immediate drive once posts are established
- **Recognition**: Opponent easily prevents stand-up by dropping weight

- **Error**: Not clearing grips during stand-up
- **Why It Fails**: Opponent maintains control and takes back or drags down
- **Correction**: Actively strip grips on hips/legs while standing up
- **Recognition**: Successfully stand but immediately get pulled back down

### Timing Considerations
When to attempt this transition:
- **Optimal Conditions**: Opponent's weight is high on back, no deep hooks, adjusting position
- **Avoid When**: Opponent has deep hooks with low heavy weight and strong grip control
- **Setup Sequences**: After defending back take attempts or when turtle becomes untenable
- **Follow-up Windows**: Must establish distance within 1-2 seconds after standing

### Prerequisites
Requirements before attempting:
- **Technical Skills**: Explosive hip drive, posting mechanics, grip stripping
- **Physical Preparation**: Leg strength for explosive drive, core for stability
- **Positional Understanding**: Turtle defense, wrestling stance, distance management
- **Experience Level**: Intermediate technique requiring explosiveness and timing
