## Technique Description
Truck Entry represents a specialized transition technique for accessing the Truck Position, a unique control configuration popularized within Eddie Bravo's 10th Planet Jiu-Jitsu system. Unlike conventional position transitions that move between traditional BJJ positions, the Truck Entry creates access to a highly specialized control position from which powerful submissions like the Twister, Calf Slicer, and Banana Split can be applied. The movement pattern involves a specific leg entanglement and body positioning that captures one of the opponent's legs while creating a dominant angle for upper body control. What makes the Truck Entry particularly valuable is its ability to convert seemingly neutral or even slightly disadvantageous scenarios into a dominant submission pathway through unconventional movement patterns. The technique requires significant body awareness and spatial understanding, often leveraging inversion and rotational mechanics that are uncommon in traditional BJJ approaches.

## Execution Steps
1. From [[Crab Ride]] (most common entry), secure a strong seat belt grip with one arm over and one arm under opponent's arms
2. Maintain back control positioning with your chest connected to the opponent's upper back
3. Place your inside leg (the leg on the same side as your underhooking arm) between the opponent's legs
4. Bring your outside leg across and behind the opponent's near leg, beginning to hook their thigh/hamstring
5. Release your over-the-shoulder arm grip and reach down to control the opponent's trapped leg
6. Slide your hips down and out to the side of the trapped leg, maintaining the leg entanglement
7. Secure your legs in triangle configuration around the opponent's captured leg
8. Adjust your upper body position to establish perpendicular alignment with the opponent's torso
9. Complete the transition to [[Truck Position]] by securing proper grips and finalizing leg configuration

## Key Details
- **Leg Triangle Configuration**: Must fully encircle opponent's trapped leg for proper control
- **Hip Movement**: Slide out to side rather than dropping straight down
- **Upper Body Connection**: Maintain constant pressure on opponent's upper body during transition
- **Hand Positioning**: One hand controls trapped leg while other maintains upper body connection
- **Leg Hooking Depth**: Hook must be placed behind knee/hamstring, not just on top of thigh
- **Body Alignment**: End position requires perpendicular orientation to opponent
- **Timing**: Execute during momentary loss of opponent's base or during directional transitions
- **Connection Points**: Never lose all connection points simultaneously during transition

## Common Defenses
- [[Leg Extension]] → [[Truck Defense]]
- [[Hip Elevation]] → [[Base Reestablishment]]
- [[Roll to Knees]] → [[Turtle Position]]
- [[Inversion Counter]] → [[Guard Recovery]]
- [[Grip Fighting]] → [[Connection Breaking]]

## Counter Techniques
- [[Strong Base Maintenance]] - Opponent widens base to prevent leg capture
- [[Hip Switch]] - Opponent changes hip orientation to counter leg entanglement
- [[Grip Breaking Sequence]] - Opponent strips controlling grips during transition
- [[Forward Drive]] - Opponent aggressively drives forward to flatten the entanglement
- [[Back Control Recovery]] - Opponent fights to reestablish conventional back control
- [[Spinning Escape]] - Opponent spins in the direction of the trapped leg to escape

## Variations
- Inverted Guard Truck Entry - Entering from inverted guard position
- Back Control Loss Truck Transition - Converting failed back control to Truck
- Rolling Truck Entry - Dynamic variation with rolling motion
- Half Guard Bottom Truck - Rare variation from bottom half guard
- Double Trouble Truck Entry - Specialized entry targeting both legs
- Quarter Guard Truck Entry - Entry from quarter guard position

## Setup Opportunities
- [[Crab Ride]] → [[Truck Entry]]
- [[Failed Berimbolo]] → [[Truck Entry]]
- [[Lost Back Control]] → [[Truck Entry]]
- [[Inverted Guard]] → [[Truck Entry]]
- [[Leg Drag Defense]] → [[Inverted Guard]] → [[Truck Entry]]
- [[Scramble Position]] → [[Truck Entry]]

## Follow-up Options
- [[Truck Position]] → [[Calf Slicer]] (primary submission)
- [[Truck Position]] → [[Twister Setup]] (specialized submission)
- [[Truck Position]] → [[Banana Split]] (alternative submission)
- [[Truck to Back]] (if submission opportunity is compromised)
- [[Truck Sweep]] (if opponent bases strongly)
- [[Electric Chair Transition]] (alternative control position)

## Expert Insights
- **Danaher System**: While not a focus in the Danaher leg lock system, Danaher acknowledges the Truck position's mechanical efficiency when properly established. When discussing related positions, he emphasizes understanding the mechanical control principles rather than focusing on the named position itself, particularly the concepts of hip control and rotational leverage that make the position effective for submissions.
- **Gordon Ryan**: Utilizes aspects of the Truck Entry selectively, typically viewing it as a transitional position that can create opportunities when more conventional approaches are defended. Ryan emphasizes maintaining constant pressure and connection throughout any transition to specialized positions, focusing on never giving the opponent space to recover during the entry sequence.
- **Eddie Bravo**: As the primary developer and proponent of the Truck Position within BJJ, Bravo has created a comprehensive system for entering and controlling this position. He emphasizes the Truck's role as a central hub in his 10th Planet system, connecting various specialized positions and submissions. Bravo particularly focuses on the entry from Crab Ride as the highest-percentage pathway, having refined the mechanical details through decades of development.

## Common Errors
- Insufficient leg control → Unable to secure proper entanglement
- Loss of upper body connection → Opponent creates defensive space
- Poor hip positioning → Reduced leverage and control
- Telegraphing the transition → Early defensive reaction
- Improper leg triangle → Ineffective leg capture
- Rushing the position transition → Loss of control points
- Inadequate perpendicular alignment → Suboptimal submission setups

## Strategic Application
- Creating submission opportunities from seemingly neutral positions
- Bypassing conventional defensive structures through unconventional transitions
- Establishing specialized control positions unfamiliar to traditional BJJ practitioners
- Converting failed back takes into offensive opportunities
- Setting up 10th Planet-specific submission chains
- Creating decision points that force defensive errors
- Exploiting opponents with strong conventional defenses but limited exposure to 10th Planet positions

## Training Approaches
- Slow-motion repetition focusing on precise mechanical details
- Progressive resistance drilling with increasing defensive intensity
- Position-specific sparring starting from pre-Truck configurations
- Transition flows linking conventional positions to Truck entries
- Submission chains connecting Truck entries to various finish options
- Defensive familiarization against common counters
- Inverted movement development and spatial awareness exercises

## Competition Effectiveness
The Truck Entry has proven particularly effective in no-gi submission-only competition formats where the specialized submissions available from the Truck Position are legal and where there are no restrictions on certain types of leg entanglement. Competition analysis shows that practitioners experienced with the position can achieve the entry with approximately 60% success against opponents unfamiliar with 10th Planet systems, though this percentage decreases significantly against those with specific defensive training. The technique's effectiveness in competition comes partly from its unorthodox nature and the decision-making pressure it creates - opponents must defend multiple simultaneous threats while managing an unfamiliar control position. Notable competition successes include Eddie Bravo himself in his matches against Royler Gracie, as well as 10th Planet competitors like Geo Martinez and Richie Martinez who have demonstrated the position's effectiveness at the highest levels of submission grappling.

## Historical Development
The Truck Position and associated entries were developed by Eddie Bravo as part of his innovative 10th Planet Jiu-Jitsu system, beginning in the early 2000s. The position evolved from Bravo's experimentation with wrestling techniques and unconventional control positions that deviated from traditional BJJ approaches. Initially met with skepticism from the broader BJJ community, the Truck and its entry methods gained legitimacy and recognition after being successfully applied in high-profile competitions. The entry methodology has evolved significantly over time, becoming increasingly refined and systematized as it was pressure-tested in competition. The most important evolutionary development has been the increased integration of the Truck Position with other 10th Planet-specific positions, creating a cohesive system of transitions and submissions rather than an isolated technique. Modern understanding of the Truck Entry now encompasses multiple pathways to the position, each with specific mechanical details and optimizations based on the starting position and opponent's defensive reactions.

## Conceptual Relationship to Computer Science
The Truck Entry demonstrates principles similar to a "context switch" in operating systems, where a process (the grappler) abruptly changes its execution environment from a standard control position to a specialized one with different privileges and capabilities. This represents a form of "lateral thinking algorithm" that solves positional problems by approaching them from unconventional angles rather than through incremental optimization of standard approaches. Just as certain programming paradigms can create unexpected solutions by reframing the problem space entirely, the Truck Entry creates submission opportunities by fundamentally changing the positional context rather than simply improving position within the traditional BJJ positional hierarchy. The technique also demonstrates principles of "fault tolerance" by providing alternative pathways to dominant positions when conventional routes fail, similar to how robust systems implement multiple methods to achieve critical outcomes when primary methods encounter resistance.
