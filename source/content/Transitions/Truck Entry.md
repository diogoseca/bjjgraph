## Transition Description
Truck Entry is an advanced offensive technique in Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu (BJJ) used to set up a submission from a top control position like Side Control or Top Half Guard, targeting the opponent's legs or back with the Truck Position or Submission Setup. This technique involves isolating an opponent's leg and transitioning to a unique control position that opens up attacks like the Twister or leg locks, effectively turning a stable control position into a submission opportunity. It is particularly effective against opponents who attempt to escape or shrimp from side control or half guard, embodying the BJJ principle of using unconventional angles and leverage to attack from superior positions. Truck Entry is a key strategy in both gi and no-gi grappling, offering a high-skill method to transition from control to a dominant submission threat with technical, dynamic movement.

## Visual Execution Sequence
Detailed description for clear visualization of the transition in action:

Starting from Side Control or Top Half Guard, you are on top of your opponent, controlling their upper body with a crossface and underhook in Side Control or isolating their legs and torso in Top Half Guard, as you remain alert for their defensive movements like hip escapes or guard recovery attempts while maintaining heavy pressure with your chest and hips to keep them pinned. As you initiate the Truck Entry, you isolate one of their legs by shifting your focus to their near leg in Side Control or the trapped leg in Top Half Guard, preparing to move your body towards their lower body while keeping your upper body control tight with an underhook or grip on their waist to prevent escapes. You begin the transition by stepping over their near leg with your far leg or freeing your trapped leg in Half Guard and sliding towards their hips, feeling their resistance as they attempt to shrimp away or re-guard, using your hips to pivot and swing your leg over to trap their isolated leg between your legs while maintaining a grip on their torso to keep them in position. With precise timing, you adjust your position to lock the Truck by rolling them slightly to their side or sitting back towards their legs, sensing their reaction as they either try to free their leg, turn away to turtle, or push against your control, while you secure their trapped leg with your legs in a figure-four configuration and control their torso with your arms to prevent escapes. Mid-transition, you maintain control by keeping your weight centered to apply pressure on their trapped leg and torso, adjusting your angle to counter their movements, as you position yourself to fully establish Truck Position by securing their leg and upper body, or prepare for a Submission Setup if they resist the initial control. You complete the Truck Entry by locking in the Truck Position, applying pressure to their leg or back by extending your legs or leaning into their torso, or transitioning to a direct Submission Setup like the Twister or a leg lock, having successfully turned your top control position into a threatening submission platform with technical precision. Throughout the movement, you remain aware of their defensive responses like hip escapes, leg freeing attempts, or reversals, adjusting your grip tightness, hip angle, and weight distribution to counter their efforts, demonstrating an effective offensive technique that transforms a stable top position into a dominant submission threat.

**Template**: "From Side Control or Top Half Guard, on top of opponent, control upper body with crossface and underhook in Side Control or isolate legs and torso in Top Half Guard, alert for defensive movements like hip escapes or guard recovery, maintain heavy pressure with chest and hips to pin. Initiate Truck Entry by isolating leg, shift focus to near leg in Side Control or trapped leg in Top Half Guard, prepare to move towards lower body, keep upper body control tight with underhook or grip on waist to prevent escapes. Step over near leg with far leg or free trapped leg in Half Guard, slide towards hips, feel resistance as they shrimp away or re-guard, use hips to pivot, swing leg over to trap isolated leg between legs, maintain grip on torso to keep in position. Adjust position with precise timing to lock Truck by rolling slightly to side or sitting back towards legs, sense reaction as they free leg, turn to turtle, or push against control, secure trapped leg with figure-four legs, control torso with arms to prevent escapes. Maintain control mid-transition by keeping weight centered for pressure on trapped leg and torso, adjust angle to counter movements, position for Truck Position by securing leg and upper body or prepare Submission Setup if resisted. Complete Truck Entry by locking Truck Position, apply pressure to leg or back by extending legs or leaning into torso, or transition to direct Submission Setup like Twister or leg lock, turn top control into threatening submission with technical precision. Stay aware of defensive responses like hip escapes, leg freeing, or reversals, adjust grip tightness, hip angle, weight distribution to counter, transform stable top position into dominant submission threat."

## Execution Steps
1. Begin in Side Control or Top Half Guard, maintaining awareness of the opponent's defensive movements and identifying an opportunity to isolate a leg while keeping heavy pressure to control their torso.
2. Isolate one of their legs by shifting focus to their near leg in Side Control or the trapped leg in Top Half Guard, preparing to move towards their lower body while maintaining upper body control with an underhook or grip on their waist.
3. Initiate the transition by stepping over their near leg with your far leg in Side Control or freeing your trapped leg in Half Guard and sliding towards their hips, pivoting your hips to trap their isolated leg between your legs while keeping a grip on their torso.
4. Lock the Truck by rolling them slightly to their side or sitting back towards their legs, adjusting your position to counter their resistance like shrimping away or freeing their leg, while securing the trapped leg with a figure-four configuration using your legs.
5. Maintain control during the transition by keeping your weight centered to apply pressure on their trapped leg and torso, using your arms to control their upper body to prevent escapes or reversals.
6. Secure the full Truck Position by tightening your legs around their trapped leg and torso, applying pressure by extending your legs or leaning into their back, ensuring their movement is restricted.
7. Complete the Truck Entry by either finishing a submission like the Twister in Truck Position or preparing a Submission Setup by chaining to other attacks like leg locks if they resist, having turned your control into a submission threat.
8. Remain aware of their defensive responses like hip escapes or reversals, adapting your grip tightness, hip angle, and weight distribution to consolidate the submission position.

## Key Details
- **Leg Isolation**: Essential to target and trap one leg for setup.
- **Hip Movement**: Shift towards lower body using hip pivot for angle.
- **Leg Trapping**: Step over or swing leg to trap opponent's leg in figure-four.
- **Torso Control**: Maintain grip on upper body to prevent escapes.
- **Pressure Application**: Center weight to control leg and torso.
- **Control Grip**: Secure waist or underhook to limit opponent's movement.
- **Counter Prevention**: Use legs and weight to block escapes or reversals.
- **Offensive Awareness**: Monitor for guard recovery or submission counters.

## Success Modifiers
Factors that influence the success rate of the transition:
- **Leg Control**: Secure positioning to isolate leg effectively (+10%)
- **Timing Precision**: Attacking at optimal moment of opponent's escape attempt (+8%)
- **Hip Mobility**: Quick movement towards lower body for angle (+7%)
- **Figure-Four Tightness**: Tight leg control for pressure on trapped leg (+5%)
- **Experience Level**: Familiarity with advanced submission setups (+5% per skill level)

## Common Counters and Counter-Attacks
Analysis of opponent responses with success rates for counter-attacks:
- **Hip Escape** → [[Guard Recovery]] (Success Rate: 30%, Conditions: opponent shrimps to recover guard during transition)
- **Leg Freeing** → [[Half Guard Bottom]] (Success Rate: 25%, Conditions: opponent frees trapped leg before Truck is locked)
- **Reversal Attempt** → [[Bottom Position]] (Success Rate: 20%, Conditions: opponent uses transition momentum for reversal)
- **Submission Counter** → [[Triangle Choke]] (Success Rate: 15%, Conditions: opponent attacks from bottom during transition)
- **Torso Escape** → [[Side Control Escape]] (Success Rate: 10%, Conditions: opponent breaks torso control before Truck is secured)

## Decision Logic for Transition
```
If [opponent's escape] exposes leg or weakens control in side or half guard:
- Initiate [[Truck Entry]] to attack leg or back (Probability: 45%)

Else if [scramble situation] offers leg isolation opportunity:
- Execute [[Truck Entry]] for submission setup (Probability: 40%)

Else if [personal strategy] favors unconventional submission attacks:
- Attempt [[Truck Entry]] to threaten from top (Probability: 35%)

Else if [opponent counters] with strong hip escape or leg freeing mid-transition:
- Adjust to [[North-South]] for alternative control (Probability: 30%)

Else if [transition fails] due to successful guard recovery or reversal:
- Transition to [[Side Control]] to mitigate (Probability: 25%)
```

## Variants
- **Standard Truck Entry**: Classic setup from Side Control with leg isolation.
- **Dynamic Truck Entry**: Incorporating feints to bait escape reactions before trapping leg.
- **Reverse Truck Entry**: Approaching from opposite side based on opponent's reaction.
- **Counter Truck Entry**: Baiting hip escape or guard recovery to open Truck entry.
- **Truck to Twister Combo**: Using Truck setup to initiate Twister submission directly.
- **Truck Entry to Leg Lock**: Moving to leg lock attacks after Truck control.
- **Combination Attack**: Chaining with other top attacks if Truck is defended.
- **No-Gi Truck Entry**: Adapted for no-gi with body lock control instead of gi grips.

## Tactical Applications
- **Submission Setup**: Primary use to threaten Twister or leg locks from top.
- **Offensive Strategy**: Turns stable control into unconventional attack opportunity.
- **Chain Attack**: Sets up follow-up submissions like Twister or Calf Slicer.
- **Energy Management**: Moderate energy cost balanced by submission threat.
- **Versatile Approach**: Works in gi and no-gi from various top control positions.

## Common Errors
For knowledge test generation and error correction:
- **Error**: Poor leg isolation or weak control before transition
- **Why It Fails**: Allows opponent to free leg or escape before Truck is locked
- **Correction**: Focus on isolating leg with proper positioning and maintain torso control before moving
- **Recognition**: Opponent easily frees leg or shrimps away during setup

- **Error**: Incorrect hip movement or slow transition to lower body
- **Why It Fails**: Leaves transition vulnerable to guard recovery or reversals due to lack of angle
- **Correction**: Move hips quickly towards lower body, creating proper control angle for Truck
