## State Machine Content Elements

### Visual Execution Sequence
Detailed step-by-step description for clear movement sequence visualization:

From an open guard or De La Riva guard position, you are on your back with your legs actively controlling the opponent's legs, typically with one foot on their hip and the other hooked behind their far leg or ankle, while maintaining a grip on their near ankle or heel with your hand. As the opponent attempts to pass your guard or advance, you use their forward momentum against them by pulling on their heel to off-balance them, simultaneously pushing with your foot on their hip to create a lever effect. You then shift your hips to the side, aligning your body perpendicular to theirs, and pull their heel across your body while driving your hooked leg down to disrupt their base further. Using your core and legs, you roll them over by pulling their upper body down with your free hand or sleeve grip, flipping them onto their back. Immediately after the sweep, you follow through by coming up on top, establishing a dominant position such as side control or mount, securing control with chest pressure and arm isolation to prevent their escape.

**Template**: "From open guard or De La Riva, control opponent's legs with feet on hip and hooked behind far leg, gripping their near heel. Pull their heel and push with your hip foot to off-balance them, shift hips to the side, and pull heel across while driving hooked leg down. Roll them over by pulling their upper body, then come up on top into side control or mount, securing dominance."

### Execution Steps (Numbered Sequence)
1. **Setup Requirements**: Establish open guard or De La Riva with leg control
2. **Initial Positioning**: Place one foot on opponent's hip, hook other behind far leg
3. **Grip Establishment**: Secure grip on opponent's near ankle or heel
4. **Opponent Response**: Opponent attempts to pass or advance forward
5. **Off-Balance Initiation**: Pull heel and push hip foot to disrupt their base
6. **Hip Adjustment**: Shift hips sideways to align perpendicular to opponent
7. **Sweep Execution**: Pull heel across, drive hooked leg down, roll opponent over
8. **Follow Through**: Come up on top into side control or mount with control

### Key Technical Details
Critical elements that determine success:
- **Heel Grip**: Secure hold on opponent's ankle or heel for control
- **Leg Leverage**: Use foot on hip and hooked leg to create off-balancing lever
- **Hip Movement**: Shift hips to side for optimal sweep angle
- **Timing**: Execute as opponent advances or overcommits forward
- **Upper Body Control**: Pull opponent's upper body down to complete roll

### Success Modifiers
Factors that increase/decrease probability:
- **Grip Quality**: Strength and control of heel grip (+/-15%)
- **Opponent Momentum**: Capitalizing on forward advance or pass attempt (+/-20%)
- **Timing Precision**: Executing at the right moment of overcommitment (+/-15%)
- **Hip Angle**: Proper sideways shift for sweep leverage (+/-10%)
- **Knowledge Test Performance**: Understanding open guard sweep mechanics (+/-10%)

## Counter-Attack Analysis

### Common Counters
Opponent responses with success rates:
- **Base Defense**: Widening base to resist sweep → [[Open Guard Top]] (Success Rate: 45%, Conditions: early recognition)
- **Posture Adjustment**: Straightening posture to resist pull → [[Open Guard Top]] (Success Rate: 40%, Conditions: quick reaction)
- **Leg Withdrawal**: Pulling leg back to break heel grip → [[Neutral Position]] (Success Rate: 35%, Conditions: fast adjustment)
- **Grip Break**: Breaking heel grip before sweep initiation → [[Open Guard Top]] (Success Rate: 30%, Conditions: strong grip defense)

Format: `[[Counter Technique]] → [[Result State]] (Success Rate: X%, Conditions: [when applicable])`

### Decision Logic
```
If [sweep setup] is recognized early:
- Execute [[Base Defense]] (Probability: 45%)

Else if [posture] can be corrected quickly:
- Execute [[Posture Adjustment]] (Probability: 40%)

Else if [leg control] can be broken:
- Attempt [[Leg Withdrawal]] (Probability: 35%)

Else [grip] is vulnerable:
- Attempt [[Grip Break]] (Probability: 30%)

Else [optimal execution]:
- Accept transition (Probability: Success Rate - Modifiers)
```

## Educational Content

### Expert Insights
Commentary as if from recognized authorities:
- **John Danaher**: "The heel grab sweep is a fundamental technique in open guard systems, demonstrating the power of using an opponent's momentum against them. The key lies in the precise coordination of the heel pull and hip push to create an unstoppable lever for the sweep. This move teaches critical concepts of off-balancing and kuzushi that apply to all guard sweeps."
- **Gordon Ryan**: "In competition, the heel grab sweep is highly effective because it catches opponents off-guard during their passing attempts. I use it to transition to top positions quickly, capitalizing on their forward pressure to score points. The technique shows how open guard can be a dynamic platform for reversals."
- **Eddie Bravo**: "Heel grab sweep integrates seamlessly with modern guard games and can be chained with other sweeps or submissions if it fails. It often surprises opponents who aren't expecting a sudden reversal from open guard, creating scramble opportunities. This move highlights how traditional sweeps can be adapted for creative no-gi applications."

Each insight should focus on one key technical or strategic element.

### Common Errors
For knowledge test generation:
- **Error**: Mistiming the heel pull and hip push
- **Why It Fails**: Allows opponent to maintain balance and resist sweep
- **Correction**: Wait for opponent's forward movement before initiating pull and push
- **Recognition**: Opponent stays upright or easily steps over during attempt

- **Error**: Insufficient grip on heel or ankle
- **Why It Fails**: Fails to off-balance opponent effectively for the sweep
- **Correction**: Secure a strong grip on heel or ankle before pulling
- **Recognition**: Opponent easily pulls leg back or breaks grip

- **Error**: Poor hip alignment or angle
- **Why It Fails**: Reduces leverage, making sweep difficult to complete
- **Correction**: Shift hips sideways to create perpendicular angle for roll
- **Recognition**: Difficulty rolling opponent over or completing sweep

### Timing Considerations
When to attempt this transition:
- **Optimal Conditions**: When opponent advances forward or attempts guard pass
- **Avoid When**: Opponent maintains strong defensive posture or wide base
- **Setup Sequences**: After establishing open guard with leg and heel control
- **Follow-up Windows**: Must complete sweep within 3-5 seconds to avoid counters

### Prerequisites
Requirements before attempting:
- **Technical Skills**: Understanding of open guard control and sweep mechanics
- **Physical Preparation**: Hip mobility and core strength for sweep
- **Positional Understanding**: Control points in open guard and De La Riva
- **Experience Level**: Intermediate - requires timing and coordination
