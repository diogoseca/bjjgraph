## State Machine Content Elements

### Visual Execution Sequence
Detailed step-by-step description for clear movement sequence visualization:

From standing position with collar tie or underhook control, you drop your level significantly by stepping deep and lowering your body while maintaining upper body contact. Your opponent typically maintains their stance or attempts to counter-grip. You then reach across with your outside hand to grab behind their near knee while simultaneously driving forward with your shoulder and upper body. The combination of knee control and forward drive disrupts their base completely, causing them to fall backward as you follow through, landing in a dominant top position with control established.

**Template**: "From standing with upper body control, you drop level dramatically and grab behind their knee while driving forward. Your opponent's base is completely disrupted as you follow through to top position."

### Execution Steps (Numbered Sequence)
1. **Setup Requirements**: Establish collar tie or underhook from standing position
2. **Initial Movement**: Drop level significantly by stepping deep and lowering body
3. **Opponent Response**: Opponent typically tries to sprawl or maintain balance
4. **Adaptation**: Adjust timing and angle based on their defensive reaction
5. **Completion**: Grab behind knee with outside hand while driving forward
6. **Consolidation**: Follow through to secure top position control

### Key Technical Details
Critical elements that determine success:
- **Grip Requirements**: Strong collar tie or underhook for upper body control
- **Base/Foundation**: Dramatic level change with deep step for knee access
- **Timing Windows**: Execute when opponent's weight is on targeted leg
- **Leverage Points**: Knee grab combined with upper body drive creates takedown
- **Common Adjustments**: Vary knee grip and drive angle based on resistance

### Success Modifiers
Factors that increase/decrease probability:
- **Setup Quality**: Strong upper body control and proper positioning (+/-15%)
- **Timing Precision**: Executing when opponent's weight is committed (+/-20%)
- **Opponent Fatigue**: Reduced defensive reactions and balance (+/-5%)
- **Knowledge Test Performance**: Understanding takedown mechanics (+/-10%)
- **Position Control**: Quality of initial grip establishment (+/-10%)

## Counter-Attack Analysis

### Common Counters
Opponent responses with success rates:
- **Sprawl Defense**: Dropping hips back to avoid knee grab → [[Standing Position]] (Success Rate: 55%, Conditions: early recognition)
- **Whizzer Control**: Using overhook to counter and reverse → [[Top Position]] (Success Rate: 45%, Conditions: superior positioning)
- **Knee Shield**: Using knee to prevent level change access → [[Clinch Position]] (Success Rate: 50%, Conditions: timing dependent)
- **Circle Away**: Moving away from takedown angle → [[Standing Position]] (Success Rate: 40%, Conditions: mobility)

Format: `[[Counter Technique]] → [[Result State]] (Success Rate: X%, Conditions: [when applicable])`

### Decision Logic
```
If [knee tap setup] is telegraphed early:
- Execute [[Sprawl Defense]] (Probability: 55%)

Else if [level change] is recognized:
- Execute [[Knee Shield]] (Probability: 50%)

Else if [takedown timing] can be reversed:
- Execute [[Whizzer Control]] (Probability: 45%)

Else [optimal takedown execution]:
- Accept transition (Probability: Success Rate - Modifiers)
```

## Educational Content

### Expert Insights
Commentary as if from recognized authorities:
- **John Danaher**: "The knee tap succeeds through precise level change and knee isolation rather than brute force. The key is understanding that the dramatic level change must be combined with proper upper body control to create an unstoppable takedown. The technique teaches fundamental principles of low-level attacks that apply throughout wrestling and BJJ."
- **Gordon Ryan**: "In no-gi competition, the knee tap is exceptional because it works well against taller opponents and doesn't rely on traditional grip systems. I use it when opponents are defensive in standing exchanges, as the low-level attack creates immediate ground engagement where I can implement my ground advantages. The element of surprise makes it highly effective."
- **Eddie Bravo**: "The knee tap integrates perfectly with other takedown attempts and can be modified for different grip configurations. When the takedown is partially defended, it often creates scramble situations that favor creative grapplers. The technique demonstrates how wrestling fundamentals can be adapted for modern grappling scenarios."

Each insight should focus on one key technical or strategic element.

### Common Errors
For knowledge test generation:
- **Error**: Attempting knee tap without proper level change
- **Why It Fails**: Insufficient angle and access to effectively grab knee
- **Correction**: Always drop level dramatically before reaching for knee
- **Recognition**: Feeling unable to reach or control opponent's knee

- **Error**: Poor upper body control during takedown execution
- **Why It Fails**: Lack of control allows opponent to defend and counter
- **Correction**: Maintain strong collar tie or underhook throughout motion
- **Recognition**: Opponent easily maintains balance despite knee control

- **Error**: Not driving forward after establishing knee control
- **Why It Fails**: Knee control alone is insufficient to complete takedown
- **Correction**: Combine knee grab with simultaneous forward drive
- **Recognition**: Opponent maintains balance despite knee being controlled

### Timing Considerations
When to attempt this transition:
- **Optimal Conditions**: When opponent has weight committed to targeted leg
- **Avoid When**: Opponent is mobile and constantly changing stance
- **Setup Sequences**: After failed grip attempts that create defensive reactions
- **Follow-up Windows**: Must complete within 2-3 seconds to prevent counter

### Prerequisites
Requirements before attempting:
- **Technical Skills**: Basic standing position control and grip fighting
- **Physical Preparation**: Hip flexibility and coordination for level changes
- **Positional Understanding**: Standing mechanics and takedown principles
- **Experience Level**: Intermediate technique requiring timing and precision

## Technical Assessment Elements

### Knowledge Assessment Questions
5 technical questions with multiple choice answers:
- **Mechanical Understanding**: "What creates the takedown force in the knee tap?"
- **Timing Recognition**: "When is the optimal moment to execute the level change?"
- **Error Prevention**: "What is the most common setup mistake?"
- **Setup Requirements**: "Which upper body control is essential for execution?"
- **Adaptation**: "How do you adjust if opponent sprawls during attempt?"

### Variants and Adaptations
