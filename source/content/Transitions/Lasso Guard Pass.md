# Lasso Guard Pass
#bjj #transition #guard-pass #lasso-guard #advanced

## Visual Execution Sequence

From lasso guard top position with your opponent's leg lassoed around your arm creating a tight loop, you first establish strong posture while controlling their opposite leg. Your opponent maintains the lasso control trying to break your posture and create sweep opportunities. You then drive your trapped arm down and across their body while rotating your shoulder forward, creating space between their shin and your shoulder. Simultaneously you step your leg forward on the lasso side, creating a backstep angle while controlling their hip. The combination of shoulder rotation, hip pressure, and angle creation breaks the lasso configuration, allowing you to extract your arm and drive into side control with heavy pressure.

**One-Sentence Summary**: "From lasso guard top, drive your trapped arm down and across while rotating your shoulder forward and creating a backstep angle to break the lasso and pass to side control."

## Execution Steps

1. **Setup Requirements**: Establish upright posture with trapped arm maintaining strong structure, control opponent's opposite leg or hip
2. **Initial Movement**: Drive trapped arm downward and across opponent's centerline while maintaining forward pressure with your body
3. **Opponent Response**: Opponent attempts to maintain lasso grip tightness and may try to off-balance you toward the lasso side
4. **Adaptation**: Rotate your shoulder forward inside the lasso loop while keeping your elbow tight, reducing the leverage of their shin control
5. **Completion**: Step forward with your leg on the lasso side creating a backstep angle, driving your hip toward their head while maintaining arm pressure
6. **Consolidation**: Extract your arm as the lasso opens, immediately establishing crossface and achieving side control with chest pressure

## Key Technical Details

- **Grip Requirements**: Control opponent's opposite leg or pants, free hand controls their hip or belt to prevent them following your movement
- **Base/Foundation**: Strong posture with forward driving pressure, wide base that resists off-balancing toward lasso side
- **Timing Windows**: Initiate when opponent has committed to lasso control and before they establish additional grips or hooks
- **Leverage Points**: Shoulder rotation inside the lasso loop combined with arm driving across body creates mechanical break in their control
- **Common Adjustments**: If lasso remains tight, increase hip pressure toward their head while continuing shoulder rotation

## Common Counters and Decision Logic

Opponent defensive responses with success rates and conditions:

- **[[Sweep from Lasso]]** → [[Top Position]] (Success Rate: 40%, Conditions: passer's weight shifts too far toward lasso side)
- **[[Omoplata Transition]]** → [[Omoplata Control]] (Success Rate: 35%, Conditions: passer's arm becomes trapped in extended position)
- **[[Triangle from Lasso]]** → [[Triangle Control]] (Success Rate: 28%, Conditions: passer's head crosses centerline during pass)
- **[[Inversion to Back]]** → [[Back Control]] (Success Rate: 25%, Conditions: opponent inverts underneath as passer commits)

### Decision Logic for AI Opponent

```
If [posture control] > 60%:
- Execute [[Sweep from Lasso]] (Probability: 40%)

Else if [trapped arm position] is extended:
- Execute [[Omoplata Transition]] (Probability: 35%)

Else if [passer's head position] crosses centerline:
- Execute [[Triangle from Lasso]] (Probability: 28%)

Else [optimal defensive conditions]:
- Accept transition (Probability: Base Success Rate - Applied Modifiers)
```

## Expert Insights

### John Danaher
"The lasso guard pass requires understanding of leverage systems and shoulder mechanics. The lasso creates control by using your opponent's shin as a fulcrum against your shoulder - to pass, you must eliminate this mechanical advantage. The key insight is that driving your arm across their centerline while rotating your shoulder forward changes the angle of force application, progressively reducing their control. This is a technical problem requiring precise biomechanical solutions rather than strength-based forcing."

### Gordon Ryan
"Against high-level lasso players, I focus on posture and hip pressure immediately. The mistake I see is people trying to pull their arm out - that's fighting the lasso at its strongest point. Instead, drive your arm down and across while stepping around. The backstep angle is crucial because it takes away their ability to follow with their hips. Stay patient, maintain pressure, and let the geometry work for you rather than muscling through."

### Eddie Bravo
"Lasso guard can be tricky because it creates that tight loop that feels impossible to escape. I teach guys to think about creating space between their shoulder and the opponent's shin first - that's your escape route. The rotation combined with forward pressure is key. You can also combine this with some calf crushing pressure on their lassoed leg to make them want to open it themselves, which speeds up the pass."

## Common Errors

### Error 1: Attempting to pull arm straight out of the lasso
- **Why It Fails**: Pulling directly against the lasso plays into its mechanical strength, making extraction nearly impossible and wasting energy
- **Correction**: Drive arm downward and across body while rotating shoulder forward, changing the angle of force to weaken the lasso
- **Recognition**: If you feel locked in place and can't make progress despite effort, you're likely pulling straight rather than changing angles

### Error 2: Allowing your weight to shift too far toward the lasso side
- **Why It Fails**: Weight distribution toward the lasso side creates sweep opportunities and reduces your ability to drive forward pressure
- **Correction**: Maintain balanced weight distribution or slightly favor the non-lasso side while driving hip pressure forward
- **Recognition**: If opponent can easily off-balance you or create sweep threats, your weight distribution is wrong

### Error 3: Neglecting to control opponent's opposite leg or hip
- **Why It Fails**: Uncontrolled free leg can establish additional hooks, create sweeps, or prevent the backstep angle needed to complete pass
- **Correction**: Establish grip or pressure control on opponent's non-lassoed side early in the passing sequence
- **Recognition**: If opponent keeps following your movement or establishing new control points, you haven't controlled their mobility

### Error 4: Poor shoulder rotation inside the lasso loop
- **Why It Fails**: Without proper shoulder rotation, the shin maintains strong leverage against your shoulder, keeping the lasso tight
- **Correction**: Actively rotate shoulder forward and inward inside the loop while keeping elbow tight to body
- **Recognition**: If the lasso remains equally tight despite arm movement, your shoulder rotation is insufficient

### Error 5: Not creating backstep angle during the pass
- **Why It Fails**: Moving directly forward allows opponent to follow with their hips and maintain guard connection
- **Correction**: Step your leg forward and around on the lasso side, creating an angle that prevents hip following
- **Recognition**: If opponent's hips keep tracking your movement and guard remains, you haven't created proper angle

## Timing Considerations

- **Optimal Conditions**: When opponent has established lasso but before they add additional control elements like collar grips or opposite hooks
- **Avoid When**: Opponent has deep collar grips combined with lasso, creating multiple control layers that must be addressed first
- **Setup Sequences**: Break or control collar grips first, then address lasso pass when their control is simplified
- **Follow-up Windows**: Must establish crossface and chest pressure within 2-3 seconds of clearing the lasso to prevent guard recovery

## Prerequisites

- **Technical Skills**: Understanding of shoulder mechanics and rotation, basic posture maintenance in open guard
- **Physical Preparation**: Shoulder mobility for rotation inside lasso loop, core strength for maintaining forward pressure
- **Positional Understanding**: Lasso guard mechanics and how it creates control through shin-to-shoulder leverage
- **Experience Level**: Advanced - requires sophisticated understanding of leverage and angle creation

   - **Answer**: C

## Variants and Adaptations

- **Gi Specific**: Use pants and belt grips for hip control, collar grips must be addressed before passing
- **No-Gi Specific**: Lasso is less common but overhook control has similar mechanics; adapt by controlling tricep and using underhook
- **Self-Defense**: Modified version focusing on quick extraction and control establishment in unpredictable scenarios
- **Competition**: Combine with other passes to create multiple threats, preventing opponent from fully committing to lasso defense
- **Size Differential**: Smaller practitioners benefit from technical shoulder rotation, larger practitioners can add more hip pressure

## Training Progressions

1. **Solo Practice**: Practice shoulder rotation mechanics and arm movement patterns without partner to develop fluidity
2. **Cooperative Drilling**: Partner maintains static lasso while you drill shoulder rotation and arm extraction slowly
3. **Resistant Practice**: Partner provides progressive resistance, attempting to maintain lasso and create sweeps
4. **Sparring Integration**: Implement pass during live rolling, recognizing lasso guard situations and timing entries
5. **Troubleshooting**: Identify specific problems in live execution - shoulder rotation, hip pressure, or angle creation and drill those elements

## Competition Applications

- **IBJJF Rules**: Legal at all belt levels, guard pass scores 3 points when knees clear and position established for 3 seconds
- **No-Gi Competition**: Less common due to lack of gi for lasso, but similar overhook control requires adapted techniques
- **Self-Defense Context**: Modified for quick extraction and control in unpredictable situations
- **MMA Applications**: Rare in MMA but principles apply to similar arm entanglements; awareness of strikes critical

## Historical Context

The lasso guard pass evolved as lasso guard became more sophisticated in Brazilian competitive BJJ, particularly as it spread through the Mendes brothers and other technical guard players. The systematic approach to passing lasso represents modern BJJ's emphasis on understanding leverage systems and biomechanical principles rather than pure athleticism. Contemporary approaches focus on changing angles of force rather than opposing the lasso's strength directly.

## Safety Considerations

- **Controlled Application**: Avoid explosive movements that could hyperextend opponent's leg in the lasso position
- **Mat Awareness**: Ensure adequate space for backstep angle creation and potential scrambles
- **Partner Safety**: Control shoulder rotation carefully to prevent sudden pressure on opponent's leg
- **Gradual Progression**: Build up speed gradually to maintain control and prevent injuries to both practitioners

## Position Integration

**Common combinations and sequences:**
- [[Lasso Guard Top]] → [[Lasso Guard Pass]] → [[Side Control Top]]
- [[Lasso Guard Top]] → [[Lasso Guard Pass]] → [[Knee Cut Pass]] (if lasso partially cleared)
- [[Lasso Guard Top]] → [[Lasso Guard Pass]] → [[Mount]] (if continuing pressure after passing)

## Related Techniques

- [[Spider Guard Pass]] - Similar grip breaking and angle creation principles applied to different guard structure
- [[Leg Weave Pass]] - Alternative approach that can address lasso through leg positioning
- [[Knee Cut Pass]] - Natural follow-up when lasso is partially cleared but guard remains
- [[Toreando Pass]] - Complementary passing approach that can be combined with lasso pass setups
