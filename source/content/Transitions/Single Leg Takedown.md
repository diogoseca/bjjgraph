## Transition Description
The Single Leg Takedown is a fundamental offensive technique in Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu (BJJ) used to transition from a Standing Position to a dominant top position such as Top Position or Side Control. This technique involves isolating one of the opponent's legs, controlling it with your arms and body, and using leverage and timing to bring them down to the mat. It is particularly effective against opponents who are standing with a wide stance or during scrambles, embodying the BJJ principle of using precise control and body mechanics to dominate from a standing engagement. The Single Leg Takedown is a versatile strategy in both gi and no-gi grappling, offering a high-percentage method to take the fight to the ground while maintaining control.

## Visual Execution Sequence
Detailed description for clear visualization of the transition in action:

Starting in a Standing Position, you and your opponent are both upright, facing each other, engaged in grip fighting with collar and sleeve grips in gi or wrist and neck control in no-gi, as you look for an opening to attack or defend against their movements. To initiate the Single Leg Takedown, you first establish control by securing a grip on their collar or neck with your left hand to control their posture, while stepping forward with your right foot to close the distance, dropping your level by bending your knees to lower your center of gravity, preparing to target their right leg, ensuring you maintain a strong base to avoid being off-balanced. You then shoot in with your head on the outside of their right hip, wrapping both arms around their right leg just below the knee, with your right arm hugging the leg tightly and your left arm reinforcing the grip, as you drive your right shoulder into their midsection to disrupt their balance, feeling their weight shift as they react to the sudden attack. With explosive timing, you lift their right leg slightly off the ground by straightening your legs, pulling it towards your right side while keeping your head tight to their hip to control their upper body, driving forward with your legs to push them backward, sensing their balance falter as they hop on their left leg to resist the takedown. Mid-transition, you maintain your grip on their leg, keeping it elevated to prevent them from stepping back into a stable stance, as you adjust your head position to the inside of their hip if needed for better leverage, circling to your right to off-balance them further, ensuring they cannot easily pull you into a guard or counter with a submission. You complete the takedown by tripping their supporting left leg with your right foot behind their heel or driving forward to force them to the mat, landing on top in a Top Position with control of their leg, or transitioning to Side Control if they turn to their side, having successfully brought the fight to the ground with a dominant position. Throughout the movement, you remain aware of their attempts to sprawl, pull guard, or counter with submissions like guillotines, adjusting your grip strength, head position, and driving pressure to counter their defenses, demonstrating an effective offensive takedown technique that shifts the fight from standing to a ground position where you can maintain control.

**Template**: "From Standing Position, both upright, facing each other, grip fighting with collar and sleeve grips in gi or wrist and neck control in no-gi, looking for attack or defense openings. Establish control, grip collar or neck with left hand for posture, step forward with right foot to close distance, drop level by bending knees, target right leg, maintain strong base. Shoot in, head outside right hip, wrap both arms around right leg below knee, right arm hugging tight, left reinforcing, drive right shoulder into midsection, disrupt balance, shift their weight. Lift right leg off ground by straightening legs, pull to right side, keep head tight to hip for upper body control, drive forward with legs, push backward, falter their balance on left leg. Maintain leg grip mid-transition, keep elevated to prevent stable stance, adjust head to inside hip if needed for leverage, circle right to off-balance, prevent guard pull or submission counter. Complete takedown by tripping left leg with right foot behind heel or driving forward to mat, land in Top Position with leg control, or transition to Side Control if they turn, bring fight to ground with dominance. Stay aware of sprawl, guard pull, or submission attempts like guillotines, adjust grip strength, head position, driving pressure to counter, shift fight from standing to ground with control."

## Execution Steps
1. Begin in a Standing Position, recognizing the opportunity for a takedown when the opponent's stance is wide or during a scramble where their balance is vulnerable.
2. Establish control by securing a grip on their collar or neck with one hand to manage their posture, stepping forward with one foot to close the distance, and dropping your level by bending your knees to prepare for the shot.
3. Shoot in with your head on the outside of their targeted hip, wrapping both arms around one of their legs just below the knee, hugging it tightly with one arm and reinforcing with the other, while driving your shoulder into their midsection to disrupt balance.
4. Lift their targeted leg slightly off the ground by straightening your legs, pulling it to the side while keeping your head tight to their hip to control their upper body, driving forward with your legs to push them backward.
5. Maintain your grip on their leg during the transition, keeping it elevated to prevent them from regaining a stable stance, as you adjust your head position or circle to the side to further off-balance them, preventing guard pulls or submission counters.
6. Complete the takedown by tripping their supporting leg with your foot behind their heel or driving forward to force them to the mat, ensuring you land on top with control of their leg.
7. Settle into a Top Position, maintaining control of their leg to prevent recovery, or transition to Side Control if they turn to their side, securing a dominant ground position.
8. Remain aware of their defensive attempts like sprawling, pulling guard, or countering with submissions, adjusting your grip strength, head position, and driving pressure to counter and consolidate the takedown.

## Key Details
- **Level Drop**: Essential to lower center of gravity for effective shot penetration.
- **Head Positioning**: Place head outside or inside hip for control and leverage.
- **Leg Grip Security**: Hug leg tightly below knee to prevent escape or counter.
- **Shoulder Drive**: Use shoulder into midsection to disrupt opponent's balance.
- **Leg Elevation**: Lift targeted leg to destabilize opponent's base.
- **Forward Pressure**: Drive forward to push opponent backward or off-balance.
- **Trip or Drive Finish**: Trip supporting leg or drive to mat for takedown completion.
- **Defensive Awareness**: Monitor for sprawls, guard pulls, or submission attempts.

## Success Modifiers
Factors that influence the success rate of the transition:
- **Timing Precision**: Executing during opponent's stance vulnerability or weight shift (+10%)
- **Level Change Effectiveness**: Proper drop in center of gravity for shot penetration (+8%)
- **Grip Strength on Leg**: Secure control of targeted leg to prevent escape (+7%)
- **Driving Pressure**: Forward momentum to disrupt balance (+5%)
- **Experience Level**: Familiarity with takedown mechanics and counters (+5% per skill level)

## Common Counters and Counter-Attacks
Analysis of opponent responses with success rates for counter-attacks:
- **Sprawl Defense** → [[Neutral Position]] (Success Rate: 40%, Conditions: opponent sprawls hips back to avoid leg control)
- **Guard Pull Counter** → [[Closed Guard]] (Success Rate: 30%, Conditions: opponent pulls guard as you shoot in)
- **Guillotine Attempt** → [[Submission Threat]] (Success Rate: 25%, Conditions: opponent catches your head in a guillotine during shot)
- **Leg Freeing** → [[Standing Position]] (Success Rate: 20%, Conditions: opponent pulls leg free before takedown completion)
- **Counter Takedown** → [[Bottom Position]] (Success Rate: 15%, Conditions: opponent uses your momentum for their own takedown)

## Decision Logic for Transition
```
If [opponent stance] is wide or weight shifted forward:
- Initiate [[Single Leg Takedown]] to exploit balance (Probability: 75%)

Else if [scramble situation] offers leg exposure:
- Execute [[Single Leg Takedown]] for control (Probability: 70%)

Else if [personal strategy] favors ground dominance:
- Attempt [[Single Leg Takedown]] to bring fight down (Probability: 65%)

Else if [opponent sprawls] or resists with strong base mid-shot:
- Adjust to [[Double Leg Takedown]] for alternative (Probability: 50%)

Else if [takedown fails] due to guard pull or submission threat:
- Transition to [[Guard Recovery]] to mitigate (Probability: 40%)
```
