## Transition Description
The Single Leg Takedown is a fundamental wrestling-based technique where the practitioner attacks one of the opponent's legs, securing it through various grips while using leverage, angle creation, and driving mechanics to take the opponent to the ground. Unlike the double leg which targets both legs simultaneously, the single leg focuses on controlling and manipulating a single leg, offering greater versatility through numerous finish variations. This takedown serves as one of the cornerstone techniques in both wrestling and BJJ standup, effective in both gi and no-gi scenarios, and represents an essential skill for competitors across all rule sets.

## Execution Steps
1. Create entry through level change, penetration step, or feint
2. Secure opponent's leg, typically at knee/calf or ankle/foot
3. Establish head position, preferably on same side as captured leg
4. Connect upper body to opponent through appropriate grips/pressure
5. Elevate leg or create angle to compromise opponent's balance
6. Execute appropriate finish based on opponent's defensive reaction
7. Follow to ground maintaining control through transition
8. Establish dominant top position (typically side control or half guard top)

## Key Grips/Controls
- Head position against opponent's hip or side (head inside or outside)
- Knee/calf control with arms wrapped around leg
- Ankle/foot control for lower variations
- Secondary upper body control (collar, underhook, etc. in gi)
- Posture control through head and spine positioning
- Running the pipe grip orientation (inside single leg)
- Double sleeve control for modified variations (in gi)
- Inside position for upper body connection

## Common Counters
- [[Sprawl]] → [[Front Headlock]]
- [[Whizzer/Overhook]] → [[Whizzer Defense]]
- [[Crossface]] → [[Balance Recovery]]
- [[Limp Leg]] → [[Neutral Standing]]
- [[Hip Switch]] → [[Counter Takedown]]

## Variants
- High Single (capturing at thigh/knee)
- Low Single (attacking ankle/foot)
- Head Inside Single Leg
- Head Outside Single Leg
- Single Leg to Trip
- Double Sleeve Single (gi specific)
- Running the Pipe Finish
- Dump Finish
- Inside Trip Variation
- Outside Trip Variation
- Cut-back/Corner Finish
- Knee Tap Variation
- Single to Double Transition

## Expert Insights
- **Danaher System**: Emphasizes the single leg as part of a systematized takedown approach that creates an integrated chain of attacks. Focuses on precise mechanical details like head position, connection points, and finish selection based on opponent reactions. Particularly emphasizes understanding the relationship between initial setup quality and subsequent finish options, viewing the single leg as a launching point for a decision tree of follow-up techniques.
- **Gordon Ryan**: Approaches the single leg with a strategic emphasis on setups through feints and misdirection, often employing it as an entry to his leg lock system when opponents defend. Focuses on seamless transitions between different takedown attempts and guard pulling options, creating a complex standing game that forces defensive reactions that can be exploited.
- **Eddie Bravo**: Has adapted traditional single leg principles for no-gi specific scenarios, focusing on variations that transition well into his 10th Planet system. Emphasizes connections between takedown success and subsequent ground control, particularly in MMA contexts where the transition between standing and ground must account for striking opportunities.

## Timing Considerations
- Execute after creating pressure that forces defensive posture
- Time with opponent's weight shift or step
- Perform after breaking opponent's grips or control
- Implement when opponent's base is compromised
- Use as counter to specific offensive movements
- Capitalize on stance vulnerabilities or imbalance

## Follow-up Options
- [[Side Control Establishment]] → [[Side Control]]
- [[Half Guard Passing Sequence]] → [[Side Control]]
- [[Submission from Knees]] → [[Front Headlock]] or [[Guillotine Control]]
- [[Back Step]] → [[Back Control]]
- [[Leg Drag]] → [[Leg Drag Position]]
- [[Knee Cut Pass]] → [[Side Control]]

## Common Errors
- Insufficient level change → Defensive sprawl opportunity
- Poor head position → Crossface vulnerability
- Attacking too far from opponent → Compromised leverage
- Neglecting upper body control → Defensive counters
- Telegraphing entry → Defensive readiness
- Inadequate drive/follow-through → Failed completion

## Historical Context
The Single Leg Takedown has roots in folk-style wrestling, freestyle wrestling, and various traditional grappling arts. It represents one of the oldest and most universal takedown methods across cultures, likely due to its mechanical efficiency and effectiveness. In Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu, the single leg gained prominence as wrestlers transitioned to BJJ and as the importance of takedowns increased in competition formats. The technique has evolved to incorporate gi-specific controls and to address the unique strategic considerations of BJJ, such as guard pulling counters and submission threats during the takedown process.

## Computer Science Analogy
The Single Leg Takedown implements a "state transition algorithm" in the BJJ state machine that converts the standing neutral state to a dominant ground position through a series of controlled mechanical steps. This creates a "decision tree implementation" where each defensive reaction by the opponent triggers a specific branching path to the appropriate finish variation. The technique exemplifies the concept of a "recursive problem-solving approach" where the core attack (leg control) remains consistent while the specific implementation details (finish mechanics) adapt dynamically to changing variables (defensive reactions).
