# Harai Goshi
#bjj #transition #takedown #judo #throw #standing

## Visual Execution Sequence

From standing position, you establish strong sleeve and collar grips while maintaining proper distance and posture. Your opponent typically responds by attempting grip fighting or maintaining their defensive stance. You initiate the throw by stepping in with your lead foot while simultaneously pulling them forward and off-balance toward your hip. As they begin to lose balance, you turn your body, inserting your hip below their center of gravity while your sweeping leg swings across their legs in a powerful arc. The combination of hip rotation, leg sweep through their base, and coordinated arm pull creates an irresistible off-balancing force that lifts them off the ground. As your opponent becomes airborne, you continue the rotational momentum, throwing them over your hip and following through to the mat where you establish side control.

**One-Sentence Summary**: "From standing with sleeve and collar grips, you step in and rotate your hip under their center while sweeping your leg across theirs, using coordinated rotation to throw them to side control."

## Execution Steps

1. **Setup Requirements**: Establish dominant sleeve and collar grips from standing position with proper distance control
2. **Initial Movement**: Step in with lead foot while pulling opponent forward and off-balance
3. **Opponent Response**: Opponent typically attempts to regain posture or pull away from throw
4. **Hip Insertion**: Turn body and insert hip below opponent's center of gravity while maintaining grips
5. **Leg Sweep Execution**: Swing sweeping leg across opponent's legs while rotating torso and pulling with arms
6. **Throw Completion**: Continue rotation and leg sweep until opponent is airborne and falling
7. **Consolidation**: Follow opponent to ground and establish side control or top position

## Key Technical Details

- **Grip Requirements**: Strong sleeve control on throwing side arm, deep collar grip for rotation control
- **Base/Foundation**: Stable posting of support leg with knee slightly bent for power generation
- **Timing Windows**: Execute when opponent steps forward or has weight on front leg
- **Leverage Points**: Hip acts as fulcrum while sweeping leg removes base and arms control upper body
- **Common Adjustments**: Vary sweep angle and hip depth based on opponent's height and stance

## Common Counters

Opponent defensive responses with success rates and conditions:

- **[[Sprawl Defense]]** → [[Standing Position]] (Success Rate: 40%, Conditions: early recognition before hip insertion)
- **[[Base Widening]]** → [[Clinch Position]] (Success Rate: 35%, Conditions: spreading stance to prevent sweep)
- **[[Counter Throw]]** → [[Top Position]] (Success Rate: 25%, Conditions: redirecting momentum with superior timing)
- **[[Hip Block]]** → [[Standing Position]] (Success Rate: 45%, Conditions: preventing hip insertion with defensive positioning)

### Decision Logic for AI Opponent

```
If [hip insertion] is prevented early:
- Execute [[Hip Block]] (Probability: 45%)

Else if [throw timing] is telegraphed:
- Execute [[Sprawl Defense]] (Probability: 40%)

Else if [opponent can] widen base:
- Execute [[Base Widening]] (Probability: 35%)

Else if [advanced skill] allows redirection:
- Execute [[Counter Throw]] (Probability: 25%)

Else [optimal execution conditions]:
- Accept transition (Probability: Base Success Rate + Applied Modifiers)
```

## Expert Insights

### John Danaher
"Harai Goshi represents the apex of coordination between three mechanical systems: the hip insertion creates the fulcrum, the sweeping leg removes the opponent's base structure, and the arm pull controls their upper body rotation. What makes this throw particularly effective is the timing window - when executed at the moment of forward weight commitment, the opponent cannot recover their base. The technique teaches fundamental principles of simultaneous action and proper sequencing that apply throughout all throwing arts."

### Gordon Ryan
"In competition, I've adapted Harai Goshi for both gi and no-gi contexts as a high-percentage takedown when opponents are hesitant to engage. The key is creating the forward momentum through grip fighting and feints, then capitalizing on that split-second of weight transfer. Landing directly into side control gives immediate positional dominance and point scoring opportunities. The throw's dynamic nature also creates psychological pressure on opponents who know they're one step away from being airborne."

### Eddie Bravo
"Harai Goshi integrates beautifully with unconventional grip configurations and can be modified from various clinch positions. I've found success chaining it with failed arm drags or collar ties, using the opponent's defensive reactions to set up the hip insertion. The technique's rotational mechanics also connect well with rubber guard entries if the throw is partially defended, creating seamless transitions between standing and ground systems. Its versatility makes it valuable beyond traditional judo applications."

## Common Errors

### Error 1: Insufficient hip insertion or turning away too early
- **Why It Fails**: Without proper hip placement below opponent's center of gravity, there's no fulcrum for the throw
- **Correction**: Commit fully to turning your back to opponent with deep hip penetration before initiating sweep
- **Recognition**: Opponent remains balanced on their feet or easily steps away

### Error 2: Sweeping leg motion too weak or timing disconnected from hip rotation
- **Why It Fails**: Leg sweep alone cannot remove opponent's base without coordinated hip rotation
- **Correction**: Synchronize powerful leg sweep with hip rotation and arm pull as one unified motion
- **Recognition**: Opponent's legs are contacted but they maintain balance and posture

### Error 3: Releasing grips or pulling in wrong direction during throw
- **Why It Fails**: Loss of upper body control allows opponent to post or twist away from throw
- **Correction**: Maintain strong grips throughout and pull in circular arc matching hip rotation
- **Recognition**: Opponent rotates away or posts hands during throw attempt

### Error 4: Poor weight distribution on support leg
- **Why It Fails**: Unstable base prevents generation of rotational power needed for throw
- **Correction**: Keep support leg slightly bent with weight centered and balanced throughout
- **Recognition**: Feeling off-balance yourself or unable to generate throwing power

### Error 5: Telegraphing the throw with obvious preparation movements
- **Why It Fails**: Gives opponent time to recognize attack and execute defensive counter
- **Correction**: Maintain normal grip fighting appearance until explosive entry
- **Recognition**: Opponent consistently defends or counters before throw initiates

## Timing Considerations

- **Optimal Conditions**: When opponent steps forward, during grip exchange, or when they pull back and then step in
- **Avoid When**: Opponent maintains extremely low defensive posture with wide stance and backward weight
- **Setup Sequences**: After failed collar drags, following arm drag attempts, or during grip fighting exchanges
- **Follow-up Windows**: Must complete throw and establish control within 3-4 seconds to prevent scramble

## Prerequisites

- **Technical Skills**: Understanding of kuzushi (off-balancing), basic standing grip fighting, fundamental hip mechanics
- **Physical Preparation**: Hip flexibility for rotation, leg strength for sweeping power, core strength for rotation
- **Positional Understanding**: Standing position control, grip dominance concepts, weight distribution awareness
- **Experience Level**: Intermediate to Advanced - requires precise timing, coordination, and practiced hip insertion mechanics

   - D) Pull guard immediately
   - **Answer**: C

## Variants and Adaptations

- **Gi Specific**: Traditional judo grips with lapel and sleeve control provide maximum rotational control and off-balancing power
- **No-Gi Specific**: Adapt to overhook and underhook combinations or collar tie with arm control, focus more on body positioning
- **Self-Defense**: Modified version using clothing grips or body control in street confrontations
- **Competition**: Combination with other throws in rapid succession (renraku-waza) or as counter to opponent's attack (kaeshi-waza)
- **Size Differential**: Taller practitioners have advantage with reach and leg sweep arc; shorter practitioners need deeper hip insertion

## Training Progressions

1. **Solo Practice**: Hip rotation movements (uchi-komi), leg sweep motion patterns, footwork and entry steps without partner
2. **Cooperative Drilling**: Partner allows throw completion with light resistance for motor pattern development and timing
3. **Resistant Practice**: Partner provides progressive resistance to grips and entries while allowing proper technique
4. **Sparring Integration**: Attempting throw during live stand-up exchanges with full resistance and counter opportunities
5. **Troubleshooting**: Identifying specific failure points (hip insertion, sweep timing, grip control) and drilling corrections

### Common Troubleshooting Patterns

```yaml
troubleshooting:
  - symptom: "Opponent maintains balance despite hip insertion"
    likely_cause: "Insufficient kuzushi or hip not deep enough under center of gravity"
    diagnostic_questions:
      - "Did you pull opponent forward before turning?"
      - "Is your hip fully inserted below their belt line?"
      - "Are you maintaining strong grip control throughout?"
    solution: "Emphasize forward pull with grips before entry, commit to deeper hip turn, maintain collar control"

  - symptom: "Leg sweep makes contact but opponent doesn't lift"
    likely_cause: "Leg sweep and hip rotation not synchronized"
    diagnostic_questions:
      - "Are you sweeping as you rotate or before?"
      - "Is support leg stable and bent?"
      - "Are arms pulling in coordination with sweep?"
    solution: "Practice simultaneous hip rotation and leg sweep, ensure support leg is loaded and stable"

  - symptom: "Opponent easily steps away or sprawls before completion"
    likely_cause: "Telegraphing throw with preparation movements"
    diagnostic_questions:
      - "Are you changing posture noticeably before entry?"
      - "Is your grip adjustment obvious?"
      - "Are you looking at their legs before attacking?"
    solution: "Maintain normal grip fighting appearance, use feints to mask actual attack, explosive sudden entry"

  - symptom: "Losing balance during throw attempt"
    likely_cause: "Poor support leg positioning or inadequate base"
    diagnostic_questions:
      - "Is support leg slightly bent with weight centered?"
      - "Are you leaning too far forward or backward?"
      - "Is support foot positioned properly perpendicular to throw?"
    solution: "Focus on support leg strength and positioning, practice weight distribution drills"

## Competition Applications

- **IBJJF Rules**: Legal at all belt levels, scores as takedown (2 points) with immediate side control establishing positional dominance
- **No-Gi Competition**: Highly effective with modified grip systems using overhooks, underhooks, and collar ties
- **Self-Defense Context**: Powerful throw for incapacitating aggressor and establishing control in real confrontations
- **MMA Applications**: Modified version viable in mixed martial arts with cage awareness and striking defense considerations

## Historical Context

Harai Goshi is one of the 40 original throws of Kodokan Judo, classified in the Dai Ikkyo (first group) of the Gokyo no Waza. Developed in the late 19th century by Jigoro Kano, it represents the principle of maximum efficiency with minimum effort. The technique has been successfully adapted into BJJ competition, particularly in gi divisions where traditional grips enhance control. Its effectiveness in both judo and BJJ competition demonstrates the universal biomechanical principles underlying successful throwing techniques.

## Safety Considerations

- **Controlled Application**: Execute with awareness of opponent's falling trajectory to prevent injury on impact
- **Mat Awareness**: Ensure adequate space around training area for safe throw completion and following to ground
- **Partner Safety**: Maintain grip connection throughout throw to control descent and prevent hard landing
- **Gradual Progression**: Build up speed and power incrementally, starting with cooperative drilling before live resistance
- **Breakfall Requirement**: Both practitioners must understand proper ukemi (breakfall techniques) before practicing throws

## Position Integration

**Common combinations and sequences:**
- [[Standing Position]] → [[Harai Goshi]] → [[Side Control]]
- [[Standing Position]] → [[Harai Goshi]] → [[Top Position]]
- [[Clinch Position]] → [[Harai Goshi]] → [[Side Control]]
- [[Standing Position]] → [[Failed Harai Goshi]] → [[Arm Drag]] (if countered)
- [[Standing Position]] → [[Harai Goshi]] → [[Mount]] (if opponent turns)
