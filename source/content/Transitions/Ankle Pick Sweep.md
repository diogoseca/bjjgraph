## Visual Execution Sequence

From open guard position with opponent standing or on one knee, you establish control on one of their legs or feet with both hands while using your legs to control distance and prevent them from posturing up or away. Your opponent attempts to maintain balance or pull their leg free. You then explosively pull their controlled ankle/foot toward you while simultaneously pushing or sweeping their other leg with your foot or shin, creating a scissoring action that eliminates their base on both sides. The combined pulling and pushing/sweeping forces collapse their structure causing them to fall as you follow through to top position, typically ending in side control or moving to turtle top if they turn.

**One-Sentence Summary**: "From open guard, grip their ankle with both hands, pull it toward you while sweeping their other leg with your foot, causing them to fall as you advance to top position."

## Execution Steps

1. **Setup Requirements**: Establish open guard distance with opponent standing or kneeling, secure two-handed grip on one ankle or foot, position your legs to control distance and prepare sweep
2. **Initial Movement**: Begin pulling controlled ankle toward you with both hands while scooting your hips closer to create better angle
3. **Opponent Response**: Opponent typically attempts to pull leg free, post other leg wider for balance, or pressure forward to maintain base
4. **Adaptation**: As they adjust base on free leg, time your sweep of that leg using your foot/shin to hook or push it away, coordinating with continued ankle pull
5. **Completion**: Execute simultaneous pulling of controlled ankle and sweeping/pushing of free leg, eliminating all base points and causing them to fall backward or to side
6. **Consolidation**: Release ankle grip as they fall and immediately advance to side control or turtle top position, establishing control before they can recover guard

## Key Technical Details

- **Grip Requirements**: Two-handed control on ankle or foot provides maximum pulling power and prevents escape. Grips should be on the actual ankle or foot rather than gi fabric for direct structural control. Can grip ankle like baseball bat or with one hand on heel and one on instep.
- **Base/Foundation**: Your seated or lying position must be mobile with hips active and able to scoot toward opponent as you pull. Static hips reduce effectiveness significantly. Core engagement allows explosive hip movement during sweep execution.
- **Timing Windows**: Optimal when opponent is transitioning weight, when they step forward attempting to pass, or when they have one knee down and one leg posted. Timing during weight transition maximizes success dramatically.
- **Leverage Points**: Pulling ankle creates direct structural disruption of their base while sweeping free leg eliminates posting option. The two forces must be coordinated precisely - pulling alone or sweeping alone allows recovery, together they are overwhelming.
- **Common Adjustments**: If ankle pull alone isn't working, increase angle by scooting hips to their side creating perpendicular pulling vector. If they post free leg very wide, use your leg to push their knee inward instead of sweeping foot. Adjust based on their balance response.

## Common Counters

Opponent defensive responses with success rates and conditions:

- **[[Wide Base and Sprawl]]** → [[Open Guard Top]] (Success Rate: 45%, Conditions: Early recognition spreading legs wide before pull completes)
- **[[Circling Away from Pull]]** → [[Open Guard Top]] (Success Rate: 40%, Conditions: Moving in circular motion away from pulling direction maintaining balance)
- **[[Forward Pressure Drive]]** → [[Headquarters Position]] (Success Rate: 35%, Conditions: Driving weight forward into you as you pull, using momentum against sweep)
- **[[Ankle Grip Break]]** → [[Standing Guard Pass]] (Success Rate: 38%, Conditions: Breaking grip and immediately standing to pass before sweep reset)

### Decision Logic for AI Opponent

```
If [ankle grip quality] < 40%:
- Execute [[Ankle Grip Break]] (Probability: 45%)

Else if [sweep is recognized early]:
- Execute [[Wide Base and Sprawl]] (Probability: 50%)

Else if [has forward momentum]:
- Execute [[Forward Pressure Drive]] (Probability: 40%)

Else [optimal sweep execution]:
- Accept transition (Probability: Base Success Rate - Applied Modifiers)
```

## Expert Insights

### John Danaher
The ankle pick sweep demonstrates fundamental principles of base elimination through coordinated multi-directional force application. The mechanical elegance lies in attacking both legs simultaneously but with different force vectors - pulling one ankle creates direct base disruption while sweeping the other leg eliminates the posting recovery option. This creates what I term "systematic base collapse" where opponent has no mechanical solution because both defensive options are addressed simultaneously. The technique requires minimal strength or athleticism, making it accessible to all body types and skill levels while remaining effective even at advanced levels when executed with proper timing and setup. Understanding ankle pick sweeps provides foundational knowledge applicable to numerous other sweeping techniques that employ similar base elimination principles.

### Gordon Ryan
In competition, ankle pick sweeps are money because they're so simple and direct that there's nothing fancy for opponent to defend - you're just attacking their structural foundation in most basic way possible. I use them constantly when opponents stand to pass because that standing posture creates perfect setup where their ankles are exposed and easily controlled. The key is commitment and speed - grab that ankle with authority, pull it hard toward you, and sweep that other leg simultaneously without hesitation. Half-hearted attempts fail because opponent recovers base, but committed execution works even when they know it's coming because the mechanics are so sound. The sweep scores points and puts you in great position to advance, making it high-percentage competition technique especially in later match stages when opponent is tired.

### Eddie Bravo
Ankle pick sweeps integrate beautifully with modern guard systems, particularly from seated guard and butterfly positions where ankle access is readily available. What I emphasize to students is the importance of angle creation - pulling straight back on ankle is less effective than pulling at angle while scooting your hips to the side, creating perpendicular force vector that maximizes base disruption. The sweep works in both gi and no-gi with identical mechanics, which makes it valuable technique for practitioners who train both styles. I also teach it as entry to more complex sequences - if ankle pick is defended, you're often in perfect position to enter leg entanglements or take the back depending on how they react. The fundamental nature of directly attacking their ankle makes it reliable technique that works across skill levels and body types.

## Common Errors

### Error 1: Pulling ankle without coordinating free leg sweep
- **Why It Fails**: Pulling ankle alone allows opponent to post their free leg and maintain balance, or simply pull their ankle back against your pulling force. Without eliminating their posting option simultaneously, their base remains partially intact.
- **Correction**: Time your free leg sweep/push to occur simultaneously with ankle pull - as you pull one ankle toward you, your leg must sweep or push their other leg away at same moment, creating coordinated base elimination
- **Recognition**: If opponent easily maintains balance by posting or they simply resist your pull without falling, you're missing the coordinated sweeping action with your legs

### Error 2: Weak or incomplete ankle grip allowing escape
- **Why It Fails**: Single-handed grip or loose two-handed grip allows opponent to pull ankle free before sweep completes, eliminating your control and resetting position to neutral
- **Correction**: Establish firm two-handed grip on actual ankle or foot structure, not just gi fabric. Grip like you mean it, with full commitment - both hands squeezing tight and pulling together toward your chest
- **Recognition**: If their ankle slips out of your grip during sweep attempt or if you feel like you're fighting to maintain control, your initial grip was insufficient

### Error 3: Static hips not scooting to create angle
- **Why It Fails**: Pulling straight backward without creating angle reduces effectiveness dramatically as their structure can resist linear pulling more effectively than angled off-balancing force
- **Correction**: As you establish ankle grip, scoot your hips toward their side creating 45-90 degree angle rather than staying directly in front of them. This angle multiplies pulling effectiveness by attacking their base from side rather than straight back
- **Recognition**: If pull feels weak or they easily resist despite good grip, check if you're pulling from angle or straight back - straight back requires much more force and is less effective

### Error 4: Attempting sweep when opponent has wide solid base
- **Why It Fails**: When opponent has both feet planted wide apart with good balance and centered weight, attempting ankle pick requires excessive force and has low success probability as their base is optimized against sweep attempts
- **Correction**: Wait for opponent to transition weight, step forward, or narrow base before attempting sweep. Timing during their movement or weight adjustment dramatically increases success. Be patient for right moment rather than forcing from poor setup
- **Recognition**: If sweep consistently fails despite good technique or requires maximum effort fighting against strong resistance, your timing is off - attacking when their base is strongest rather than vulnerable

### Error 5: Not following through to top position after sweep
- **Why It Fails**: Creating the sweep but not immediately advancing allows opponent to recover guard or turtle, eliminating the positional advantage the sweep should provide. Points are awarded for sweep completion, not just knocking them down.
- **Correction**: Release ankle grip as they fall and immediately advance your body over them establishing side control or turtle top position. Follow their momentum forward, don't let them fall away from you
- **Recognition**: If you successfully sweep them but they recover guard quickly or you end up back in neutral position, you're not following through with aggressive advancement after the sweep

## Timing Considerations

- **Optimal Conditions**: Best when opponent is standing attempting to pass, when they have one knee down with weight transitioning, or when they step forward creating momentary base vulnerability
- **Avoid When**: Opponent is low with both knees down and wide base, when they have double underhooks or strong upper body control limiting your mobility, or when your own balance is compromised
- **Setup Sequences**: After opponent defends different sweep attempt and adjusts their base standing up, after failed pass attempt when they reset to standing, or when transitioning from butterfly guard to open guard as they stand
- **Follow-up Windows**: Must complete advancement to top position within 2-3 seconds after sweep or opponent can reguard or turtle defensively. Immediate forward pressure after sweep critical for consolidation

## Prerequisites

- **Technical Skills**: Basic open guard control and distance management, fundamental sweep mechanics understanding, basic grip fighting to establish ankle control
- **Physical Preparation**: Core strength for maintaining seated or guard position while pulling, hip mobility for angle creation during sweep setup
- **Positional Understanding**: Open guard principles, base elimination concepts, basic understanding of weight distribution and balance disruption
- **Experience Level**: Beginner-friendly - one of the first sweeps taught due to simplicity and low physical requirements. Effective for all skill levels with proper execution.

## Knowledge Assessment

1. **Mechanical Understanding**: "What creates the sweeping force in ankle pick sweep?"
   - A) Only pulling the ankle toward you
   - B) The combination of pulling one ankle and sweeping/pushing the other leg simultaneously
   - C) Only pushing their free leg with your leg
   - D) Opponent's forward momentum alone
   - **Answer**: B

2. **Timing Recognition**: "When is the optimal moment to execute ankle pick sweep?"
   - A) When opponent has both knees down with wide stable base
   - B) When opponent is static and centered
   - C) When opponent is transitioning weight, stepping forward, or has one knee down
   - D) Only when they're not expecting it
   - **Answer**: C

3. **Error Prevention**: "What is the most common mistake that causes ankle pick sweep to fail?"
   - A) Pulling ankle without coordinating sweep of their free leg simultaneously
   - B) Pulling too hard
   - C) Using correct angle
   - D) Following through to top position
   - **Answer**: A

4. **Setup Requirements**: "What type of grip is most effective for ankle pick sweep?"
   - A) Single hand on gi pants
   - B) Two-handed grip on actual ankle or foot structure
   - C) Both hands on their upper body
   - D) No grip, just using legs
   - **Answer**: B

5. **Adaptation**: "How should you adjust if opponent maintains balance by posting their free leg wide?"
   - A) Force the same sweep harder
   - B) Give up immediately
   - C) Adjust your leg to push their knee inward instead of sweeping foot, or create better angle by scooting hips
   - D) Stand up and abandon sweep
   - **Answer**: C

## Variants and Adaptations

- **Gi Specific**: Can grip gi pants at ankle for secure control though direct ankle grip remains preferable. Gi friction helps maintain grip but slows down sweep execution slightly. Collar grips with free hand enhance control in some variations.
- **No-Gi Specific**: Direct ankle/foot grip is essential as fabric is unavailable. Consider gripping heel and instep for maximum control. Technique mechanics remain identical with slightly faster execution due to lack of friction. Overhooks and underhooks with free arm useful during sweep completion.
- **Self-Defense**: Highly applicable in standing self-defense scenarios as ankle pick can be executed from standing position against opponent attempting to strike or close distance. Must immediately stand after sweep rather than staying on ground. Works well from clinch positions.
- **Competition**: Effective at all competition levels, scores 2 points for sweep. IBJJF, ADCC, and submission-only formats all favor ankle pick due to simplicity and reliability. Works in both gi and no-gi equally. Often used in late match when opponent is fatigued.
- **Size Differential**: Excellent for smaller practitioners as technique relies on base elimination rather than strength. Larger opponents may have difficulty reaching ankles from certain guard positions. Adjust distance management based on relative leg length - longer legs require different spacing.

## Training Progressions

1. **Solo Practice**: Practicing grip motion and pulling/sweeping coordination without partner, developing muscle memory for simultaneous actions, core engagement for hip mobility and scooting
2. **Cooperative Drilling**: Partner allows ankle control and sweep completion at moderate speed focusing on proper grip, angle creation, simultaneous pulling and sweeping, and advancing to top position immediately
3. **Resistant Practice**: Partner provides progressive resistance - first allowing sweep, then attempting to maintain base and post, finally full defensive resistance requiring optimal timing and commitment
4. **Sparring Integration**: Implementing ankle pick sweeps during live rolling, developing recognition of setup opportunities when opponent stands or transitions, integrating with other open guard techniques
5. **Troubleshooting**: Analyzing why sweeps fail during live training - grip quality, timing, coordination of pulling and sweeping, angle creation, or follow-through issues

troubleshooting:
  - symptom: "Opponent maintains balance by posting free leg"
    likely_cause: "Not coordinating free leg sweep with ankle pull"
    diagnostic_questions:
      - "Are you sweeping their free leg simultaneously with ankle pull?"
      - "Is timing of pull and sweep coordinated or sequential?"
      - "Is your leg making contact with their free leg during pull?"
    solution: "Focus on simultaneous execution - as hands pull ankle, your leg sweeps their free leg at exact same moment, eliminating all base points"

  - symptom: "Ankle slips out of grip before sweep completes"
    likely_cause: "Weak grip or gripping gi fabric instead of ankle structure"
    diagnostic_questions:
      - "Are both hands gripping tightly with full commitment?"
      - "Are you gripping the actual ankle/foot or just gi fabric?"
      - "Is grip established deeply before attempting pull?"
    solution: "Establish firm two-handed grip directly on ankle or foot structure, squeeze tight and commit fully before pulling"

  - symptom: "Sweep feels weak, opponent easily resists pull"
    likely_cause: "Static hips pulling straight back without angle creation"
    diagnostic_questions:
      - "Are you scooting hips to create angle before pulling?"
      - "Is pull coming from angle or straight backward?"
      - "Are hips mobile and active or static on ground?"
    solution: "Scoot hips toward their side creating 45-90 degree angle before pulling, pull from angle rather than straight back, keep hips mobile throughout"

## Competition Applications

- **IBJJF Rules**: Legal at all belt levels, sweep scores 2 points. Simple and reliable for competition due to low technical requirements and high success rate when executed properly. Works when opponent attempts to stand and pass.
- **No-Gi Competition**: Identical mechanics to gi, slightly faster execution. Effective in submission-only and points-based no-gi formats. ADCC rules favor this sweep for its simplicity and point scoring.
- **Self-Defense Context**: Highly applicable as ankle pick can be executed from standing clinch position against untrained opponents. Must immediately stand after sweep rather than staying on ground. Single-leg takedown principles apply.
- **MMA Applications**: Used frequently in MMA especially when opponent attempts to stand from guard. Allows immediate advancement to top position for ground and pound. Wrestling-based fighters often defend this well, requiring setup and timing.

## Historical Context

Ankle pick sweep represents fundamental wrestling takedown adapted to BJJ ground fighting context. The technique has been part of Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu since early days, taught as one of first sweeps to beginners due to its simplicity and mechanical soundness. Wrestling-based ankle picks from standing were adapted to guard situations where bottom practitioner attacks passing opponent's ankles. The technique remains relevant at highest competition levels despite its fundamental nature because base elimination through ankle control is universally effective regardless of opponent's skill level.

## Safety Considerations

- **Controlled Application**: Pull ankle firmly but not with sudden jerking motion that could injure their ankle or knee if they resist awkwardly
- **Mat Awareness**: Ensure adequate space for opponent to fall safely without hitting walls or obstacles, particularly important when drilling
- **Partner Safety**: Allow partner to breakfall properly especially during learning phases, control speed of sweep execution
- **Gradual Progression**: Build coordination of pulling and sweeping through progressive resistance before attempting at full speed in live training

## Position Integration

**Common combinations and sequences:**
- [[Open Guard Bottom]] → [[Ankle Pick Sweep]] → [[Side Control Top]]
- [[Open Guard Bottom]] → [[Ankle Pick Sweep]] → [[Turtle Top]] (if opponent turns during fall)
- [[Butterfly Guard]] → [[Ankle Pick Sweep]] (when opponent stands to defend butterfly sweep)

## Related Techniques

- [[Tripod Sweep]] - Similar guard sweep attacking opponent's base when standing with different leg configuration
- [[Sickle Sweep]] - Related sweep using hooking motion with leg similar to ankle pick's sweeping action
- [[Foot Grab Sweep]] - Nearly identical technique with slight variation in grip and execution emphasis
- [[Single Leg Takedown]] - Standing wrestling technique using identical ankle control and pulling mechanics
