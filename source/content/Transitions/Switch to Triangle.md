## Transition Description
The Switch to Triangle is a tactical transition that redirects an existing attack or control position into the powerful triangle choke position. This transition capitalizes on the opponent's defensive reactions to other threats, creating an opportunity to secure their head and one arm between the practitioner's legs. Unlike direct triangle attacks, the switch relies on the opponent's defensive movement and positioning that can be exploited when they focus on defending a different submission or control position. This technique exemplifies the concept of chain attacks, where the threat of one submission creates the opening for another, making it particularly effective against skilled opponents who successfully defend initial attacks.

## Visual Execution Sequence
Detailed description for clear visualization of the transition scenario:

Starting from a closed guard bottom position, you control your opponent's posture with a strong collar grip, pulling them down to prevent their escape, while they defend an initial armbar attempt by keeping their arms tight and posturing up, creating a momentary opening for the triangle switch. You shift your hips to create a perpendicular angle, breaking their alignment by moving your body to the side, using your left hand to secure their right wrist across their centerline, ensuring their arm is isolated for the setup. With a swift motion, you swing your right leg over their right shoulder, trapping their arm and neck, while your left leg hooks under their left armpit, beginning to form the figure-four lock critical for triangle control. You pull their head down with both hands on the back of their neck, closing the space to prevent them from posturing out, feeling their resistance as they try to stand. Adjusting your angle further, you tighten the leg lock by crossing your right ankle over your left shin, maximizing pressure on their carotid arteries, securing the triangle position. Throughout the transition, you maintain constant control, ready to adjust if they attempt a stack defense by shifting your hips to counter their weight. Finally, you stabilize in Triangle Control, prepared to finish the choke or transition to related submissions like an armbar if they manage a partial escape, demonstrating the fluidity of chain attacking through this switch.

**Template**: "From closed guard bottom, control opponent's posture with collar grip, pull down as they defend armbar by posturing. Shift hips perpendicular, break alignment, secure right wrist across centerline with left hand. Swing right leg over right shoulder, trap arm and neck, hook left leg under left armpit for figure-four. Pull head down with both hands, close space to block posture. Tighten leg lock, cross right ankle over left shin, maximize carotid pressure. Maintain control, adjust hips against stack defense. Stabilize in Triangle Control, ready for choke finish or armbar transition if escape attempted."

## Execution Steps
1. From the initial position like closed guard bottom, recognize the opponent's defensive structure and arm positioning, identifying a momentary lapse as they defend another threat.
2. Control the opponent's wrist or sleeve on one side with a firm grip, ensuring their arm is positioned for isolation across their centerline.
3. Create an angle by shifting your hips perpendicular to the opponent, breaking their alignment to facilitate the leg placement for the triangle.
4. Insert your leg over the opponent's shoulder on the controlled arm side, trapping their arm and neck while the other leg prepares to hook under their opposite arm.
5. Secure the opponent's arm across their centerline, maintaining control to prevent defensive framing or posture recovery during the transition.
6. Lock your legs in a figure-four configuration, with one leg over their shoulder and the other under their arm, forming the base of triangle control.
7. Pull down on the opponent's head with both hands to close any defensive space, ensuring they cannot posture up or escape the position.
8. Adjust your angle and leg positioning to maximize pressure on the carotid arteries, stabilizing in Triangle Control, ready for the choke or further transitions.

## Key Details
- **Angle Creation**: Position at a perpendicular angle to the opponent for optimal leverage during the transition.
- **Arm Control**: Manipulate the opponent's arm across their centerline before securing the triangle to prevent defensive framing.
- **Head Control**: Pull the head down to eliminate defensive space, crucial for maintaining control in the triangle position.
- **Leg Positioning**: Lock in a figure-four with precise placement across the neck and arm to establish effective control.
- **Hip Mobility**: Use active hip movement to create and maintain the proper angle throughout the transition.
- **Grip Sequence**: Maintain sleeve or collar control during the switch to ensure positional dominance.
- **Entry Timing**: Execute the transition during the opponent's defensive adjustment to an initial threat for maximum success.
- **Space Management**: Close all defensive gaps as the triangle position is secured to prevent escapes.

## Success Modifiers
Factors that influence the success rate of the transition:
- **Timing Precision**: Executing during opponent's defensive adjustment to another threat (+15%)
- **Angle Accuracy**: Achieving perpendicular alignment for optimal leverage (+10%)
- **Arm Control Quality**: Effectiveness in isolating opponent's arm across centerline (+10%)
- **Hip Mobility**: Ability to dynamically adjust angle with hip movement (+10%)
- **Experience Level**: Familiarity with triangle setups and chain attacks (+5% per skill level)

## Common Counters and Counter-Attacks
Analysis of opponent responses with success rates for counter-attacks during the transition:
- [[Posture Up]] → [[Triangle Escape Position]] (Success Rate: 50%, Conditions: opponent postures before triangle is locked)
- [[Stack Defense]] → [[Triangle Escape Position]] (Success Rate: 45%, Conditions: opponent stacks weight to prevent leg lock)
- [[Hand Fighting]] → [[Grip Breaking]] (Success Rate: 40%, Conditions: opponent fights initial arm control)
- [[Shoulder Walk]] → [[Defensive Posture]] (Success Rate: 35%, Conditions: opponent walks shoulder to escape angle)
- [[Arm Positioning Defense]] → [[Combat Base]] (Success Rate: 30%, Conditions: opponent positions arm to block triangle entry)

## Decision Logic for Opponent Behavior
```
If [opponent postures up] before triangle lock:
- Adjust with [[Posture Control Counter]] to pull head down harder (Probability: 60%)

Else if [opponent stacks weight] to prevent lock:
- Shift hips with [[Stack Defense Counter]] to maintain angle (Probability: 55%)

Else if [opponent fights hand control] for arm:
- Reinforce [[Grip Reinforcement]] to secure wrist (Probability: 50%)

Else if [opponent walks shoulder] to escape angle:
- Execute [[Angle Adjustment]] to re-align perpendicular (Probability: 45%)

Else if [opponent positions arm] to block entry:
- Use [[Arm Isolation Counter]] to force arm across centerline (Probability: 40%)

Else [maintain transition]:
- Continue with [[Triangle Lock Completion]] for control (Probability: 70%)
```
