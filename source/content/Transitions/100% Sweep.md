## State Machine Content Elements

### Visual Execution Sequence
Detailed step-by-step description for clear movement sequence visualization:

From a Closed Guard Bottom position, you start on your back with your legs locked around the opponent's waist, facing them as they posture up or attempt to break your guard, with your hands controlling their wrists or sleeves to prevent strikes or grip breaks, while maintaining a tight guard to keep their posture under control, and your feet locked securely behind their back to trap them in place, ready to initiate the sweep. You maintain a strong connection with your legs, keeping your knees squeezed to limit their movement, while your upper body is slightly elevated using your core to create tension, ensuring your head is positioned defensively to avoid being easily stacked, as you prepare to isolate one of their arms by pulling it across your body to trap it against your torso with an overhook or grip, using your other hand to control their opposite wrist or sleeve to prevent them from posturing fully. As you initiate the sweep, you break their posture further by pulling down with your legs and core while swinging the trapped arm across your body to the opposite side, simultaneously shifting your hips to the side of the trapped arm to create an angle, using your legs to pull them forward and down to off-balance them, while your free leg unlocks from the closed guard and plants on the mat to assist in the hip escape and create leverage for the sweep. With the opponent off-balanced and their arm trapped, you continue the motion by driving your hips upward and to the side, using your planted foot to push off the mat and roll them over their trapped arm and shoulder, maintaining control of their upper body as they fall to their back, ensuring you follow through by coming up on top, often landing in a dominant position like mount or a high side control if their legs are open. You consolidate the position by securing an underhook or head control to prevent their immediate escape, having successfully reversed the position from bottom closed guard to top dominance through an advanced arm trap sweep.

**Template**: "From Closed Guard Bottom, lock legs around opponent's waist, control wrists/sleeves, maintain tight guard. Keep knees squeezed, elevate upper body, trap one arm across body with overhook. Break posture, pull arm across, shift hips to trapped arm side, plant foot on mat for leverage. Drive hips up and to side, roll opponent over trapped arm, follow to top position or mount. Consolidate with underhook/head control to secure dominance."

### Execution Steps (Numbered Sequence)
1. **Setup Requirements**: Start in Closed Guard Bottom with legs locked around opponent
2. **Grip Establishment**: Control opponent's wrists or sleeves to limit their actions
3. **Posture Control**: Maintain tight guard, squeeze knees to break opponent's posture
4. **Arm Isolation**: Trap one arm across your body using overhook or grip control
5. **Hip Preparation**: Shift hips to side of trapped arm, create angle for sweep
6. **Leg Adjustment**: Unlock one leg, plant foot on mat for leverage and hip escape
7. **Off-Balance Action**: Pull opponent forward/down with legs, swing trapped arm across
8. **Hip Drive**: Drive hips upward and to side, use planted foot to push off mat
9. **Sweep Completion**: Roll opponent over trapped arm/shoulder, maintain upper body control
10. **Position Consolidation**: Follow through to top position, secure underhook/head control

### Key Technical Details
Critical elements that determine success:
- **Arm Trap**: Secure control of opponent's arm across body to limit defense
- **Posture Breaking**: Effective pulling with legs and core to disrupt opponent's balance
- **Hip Angle**: Shifting hips to create optimal angle for sweep leverage
- **Leg Leverage**: Planted foot on mat to drive hips and assist in rolling action
- **Follow-Through**: Continuous motion to come up on top after sweep

### Success Modifiers
Factors that increase/decrease probability:
- **Arm Control**: Effectiveness of trapping opponent's arm (+/-20%)
- **Opponent Posture**: Degree of posture break or forward lean (+/-15%)
- **Hip Mobility**: Ability to shift and drive hips dynamically (+/-15%)
- **Leg Stability**: Strength of planted foot for leverage (+/-10%)
- **Knowledge Test Performance**: Understanding closed guard sweep mechanics (+/-10%)

## Counter-Attack Analysis

### Common Counters
Opponent responses with success rates:
- **Posture Recovery**: Regaining upright posture to resist sweep → [[Closed Guard Top]] (Success Rate: 40%, Conditions: early recognition)
- **Arm Freeing**: Pulling trapped arm free from control → [[Neutral Position]] (Success Rate: 30%, Conditions: strong grip break)
- **Base Widening**: Lowering center of gravity to resist roll → [[Top Position]] (Success Rate: 20%, Conditions: quick reaction)
- **Counter Sweep**: Using sweep momentum for own attack → [[Top Position]] (Success Rate: 10%, Conditions: advanced skill)

Format: `[[Counter Technique]] → [[Result State]] (Success Rate: X%, Conditions: [when applicable])`

### Decision Logic
```
If [sweep setup] is recognized early:
- Execute [[Posture Recovery]] (Probability: 40%)

Else if [grip break] can free trapped arm:
- Attempt [[Arm Freeing]] (Probability: 30%)

Else if [center of gravity] can be lowered quickly:
- Execute [[Base Widening]] (Probability: 20%)

Else [advanced skill] allows counter attack:
- Attempt [[Counter Sweep]] (Probability: 10%)

Else [optimal execution]:
- Accept transition (Probability: Success Rate - Modifiers)
```

## Educational Content

### Expert Insights
Commentary as if from recognized authorities:
- **John Danaher**: "The 100% Sweep is an advanced closed guard technique that exemplifies the principle of isolating a limb to create sweeping leverage. The key is in trapping the arm across the body and using precise hip movement to off-balance the opponent, demonstrating how control can overcome strength. This sweep teaches critical principles of limb isolation and angle creation that are essential for sophisticated guard systems."
- **Gordon Ryan**: "In competition, the 100% Sweep is a high-percentage move from closed guard, especially against opponents who posture aggressively. I focus on securing the arm trap and exploding through the hip shift to ensure they roll over cleanly. This technique shows how advanced guard sweeps can be adapted into dominant attacks from the bottom."
- **Eddie Bravo**: "100% Sweep is a slick advanced sweep that blends classic closed guard with modern control concepts, offering a reliable way to reverse position. It’s a great move for grapplers who like to isolate limbs and create dynamic sweeps, often chaining into submissions. This sweep integrates well with systems that prioritize fluid transitions and off-balancing from the guard."

Each insight should focus on one key technical or strategic element.

### Common Errors
For knowledge test generation:
- **Error**: Ineffective arm trap or control
- **Why It Fails**: Lacks isolation of opponent's arm, allowing them to defend or posture
- **Correction**: Secure strong overhook or grip, pull arm tightly across body
- **Recognition**: Opponent easily frees arm or maintains balance

- **Error**: Poor hip angle or insufficient shift
- **Why It Fails**: Reduces leverage for sweep, making roll difficult
- **Correction**: Shift hips significantly to side of trapped arm for optimal angle
- **Recognition**: Sweep stalls or opponent resists with base

- **Error**: Lack of posture breaking before sweep
- **Why It Fails**: Allows opponent to maintain balance, countering the sweep
- **Correction**: Pull opponent down with legs and core to disrupt posture first
- **Recognition**: Opponent remains upright or counters with posture recovery

### Timing Considerations
When to attempt this transition:
- **Optimal Conditions**: When opponent postures up or leans forward in closed guard
- **Avoid When**: Opponent maintains low, defensive posture with strong base
- **Setup Sequences**: After establishing arm control and breaking opponent's posture
- **Follow-up Windows**: Must complete sweep within 3-5 seconds to avoid counters

### Prerequisites
Requirements before attempting:
- **Technical Skills**: Understanding of closed guard principles and sweep mechanics
- **Physical Preparation**: Hip mobility and core strength for dynamic motion
- **Positional Understanding**: Control points in closed guard and arm isolation
- **Experience Level**: Intermediate to Advanced - requires precise timing and control
