## State Machine Content Elements

### Visual Execution Sequence
Detailed step-by-step description for clear movement sequence visualization:

From standing position with control established, you close the distance and secure grips on your opponent's collar and sleeve. You step forward with your lead foot, positioning it between your opponent's legs while maintaining upright posture. Simultaneously, you hook your rear leg behind their far leg at ankle height, applying pressure behind their heel while pulling them forward with your upper body grips. The combination of the forward upper body pull and the rear leg hook disrupts their balance, causing them to fall backward as you drive them to the mat, following through to establish top position or side control.

**Template**: "From standing with grips secured, step forward between opponent's legs, hook rear leg behind their far ankle, pull forward with grips while driving leg back to sweep them to the mat."

### Execution Steps (Numbered Sequence)
1. **Setup Requirements**: Establish standing position with collar and sleeve grips
2. **Initial Movement**: Close distance and step forward between opponent's legs
3. **Opponent Response**: Opponent typically maintains balance or attempts to grip fight
4. **Adaptation**: Hook rear leg behind opponent's far ankle at heel level
5. **Completion**: Pull forward with upper body while driving hooked leg back
6. **Consolidation**: Follow through by establishing top position or side control

### Key Technical Details
Critical elements that determine success:
- **Grip Requirements**: Strong collar and sleeve grips for control and direction
- **Base/Foundation**: Lead foot positioned between opponent's legs for stability
- **Timing Windows**: Execute when opponent's weight is on their far leg
- **Leverage Points**: Upper body pull combined with leg hook creates rotational off-balance
- **Common Adjustments**: Vary timing and leg hook depth based on opponent's stance

### Success Modifiers
Factors that increase/decrease probability:
- **Setup Quality**: Strong grips and proper foot positioning (+/-15%)
- **Timing Precision**: Executing during optimal weight distribution (+/-15%)
- **Opponent Fatigue**: Reduced defensive reactions and balance (+/-5%)
- **Knowledge Test Performance**: Understanding takedown mechanics (+/-10%)
- **Position Control**: Quality of grip control and posture (+/-10%)

## Counter-Attack Analysis

### Common Counters
Opponent responses with success rates:
- **[[Sprawl Defense]]** → [[Neutral Position]] (Success Rate: 45%, Conditions: early recognition)
- **[[Weight Shift Forward]]** → [[Front Headlock]] (Success Rate: 35%, Conditions: quick reaction)
- **[[Counter Throw]]** → [[Top Position]] (Success Rate: 25%, Conditions: superior timing)
- **[[Grip Break]]** → [[Standing Position]] (Success Rate: 40%, Conditions: strong grip defense)

Format: `[[Counter Technique]] → [[Result State]] (Success Rate: X%, Conditions: [when applicable])`

### Decision Logic for Opponent Behavior
```
If [takedown timing] is telegraphed early:
- Execute [[Sprawl Defense]] (Probability: 45%)

Else if [grip break] can prevent control:
- Execute [[Grip Break]] (Probability: 40%)

Else if [weight shift] can counter momentum:
- Execute [[Weight Shift Forward]] (Probability: 35%)

Else [optimal takedown execution]:
- Accept transition (Probability: Success Rate - Modifiers)
```

## Educational Content

### Expert Insights
Commentary as if from recognized authorities:
- **John Danaher**: "Kosoto Gake succeeds through precise timing and coordination of upper and lower body movements. The key is to position your lead foot between their legs for stability while the hooking action behind their ankle creates the sweeping motion. The upper body pull must be synchronized with the leg hook to create irresistible rotational force."
- **Gordon Ryan**: "In competition, I use Kosoto Gake when opponents maintain an upright posture and resist my other takedown attempts. It's particularly effective in no-gi when transitioning from clinch positions. The technique allows for immediate top position without exposing yourself to counter attacks."
- **Eddie Bravo**: "Kosoto Gake integrates well with wrestling-based takedowns and can be set up from various standing control positions. It's a low-risk technique that creates opportunities for follow-up attacks if the initial sweep is defended. The simplicity makes it reliable under pressure."

Each insight should focus on one key technical or strategic element.

### Common Errors
For knowledge test generation:
- **Error**: Hooking leg too high on opponent's leg
- **Why It Fails**: Reduces leverage and allows opponent to maintain balance
- **Correction**: Hook behind the ankle at heel level for maximum effectiveness
- **Recognition**: Opponent easily maintains balance during attempt

- **Error**: Not stepping deep enough with lead foot
- **Why It Fails**: Insufficient stability and power generation
- **Correction**: Step forward between opponent's legs for proper position
- **Recognition**: Feeling unstable or off-balance during execution

- **Error**: Pulling straight back instead of forward and down
- **Why It Fails**: Allows opponent to resist with their structure intact
- **Correction**: Pull forward and down to break their posture completely
- **Recognition**: Opponent maintains upright posture during attempt

### Timing Considerations
When to attempt this transition:
- **Optimal Conditions**: When opponent's weight is on their far leg
- **Avoid When**: Opponent has wide stance or low center of gravity
- **Setup Sequences**: After failed collar drag or other standing attacks
- **Follow-up Windows**: Must complete transition within 2-3 seconds

### Prerequisites
Requirements before attempting:
- **Technical Skills**: Basic standing control and grip fighting fundamentals
- **Physical Preparation**: Balance and coordination for timing-based execution
- **Positional Understanding**: Standing position mechanics and takedown principles
- **Experience Level**: Intermediate technique requiring timing mastery
