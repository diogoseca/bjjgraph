### Visual Execution Sequence
Detailed step-by-step description for clear movement sequence visualization:

From a Closed Guard Bottom position, you start on your back with both legs locked around the opponent's waist, controlling their posture with your arms, pulling them down with a grip on their head or collar while your legs squeeze to maintain the guard, preventing them from standing or passing as they attempt to break your control or initiate a pass, with your hips active and ready to create angles for attack. You initiate the omoplata setup by breaking their posture further, using one hand to control their wrist on the side you plan to attack, while your other hand grips their collar or head to keep them down, then swiftly opening your guard to swing one leg over their shoulder on the controlled arm side, trapping their arm between your legs as you pivot your hips to the side, creating an angle perpendicular to their body, positioning their shoulder in a vulnerable lock setup. As you secure the omoplata position, you sit up slightly to maintain control, using your legs to isolate their arm, with your top leg pressing down on their back to keep them flattened while your bottom leg hooks under their armpit to lock the shoulder, ensuring their posture remains broken, then using your grip on their wrist to pull their arm straight, increasing pressure on the shoulder joint, while simultaneously shifting your hips further to the side to prepare for the sweep. With the opponent off-balanced and their arm controlled in the omoplata setup, you initiate the sweep by rolling them over their trapped shoulder side, using your legs to drive their upper body down to the mat while maintaining the arm isolation, pushing with your bottom leg against their torso for additional leverage as you roll, ensuring you follow through by coming up on top, often landing in a dominant position like side control or a high guard if they resist, having reversed the position from bottom closed guard to top dominance. You consolidate the position by securing an underhook or crossface to prevent their immediate escape, ready to transition to a submission if the opportunity arises, having successfully executed a dynamic omoplata sweep.

**Template**: "From Closed Guard Bottom, lock legs around waist, control posture with arms. Break posture, control wrist, grip collar/head, open guard, swing leg over shoulder to trap arm, pivot hips perpendicular. Sit up, isolate arm with legs, press down on back, hook under armpit, pull arm straight, shift hips for sweep. Roll opponent over trapped shoulder, drive upper body down, push with leg for leverage, follow to top position or side control. Consolidate with underhook/crossface to secure dominance."

### Execution Steps (Numbered Sequence)
1. **Setup Requirements**: Start in Closed Guard Bottom with legs locked around opponent's waist
2. **Posture Control**: Break opponent's posture with grip on head/collar, squeeze legs
3. **Arm Isolation**: Control opponent's wrist on attack side, maintain posture control
4. **Guard Opening**: Open guard, swing one leg over shoulder to trap targeted arm
5. **Hip Pivot**: Pivot hips to side, create perpendicular angle to opponent's body
6. **Omoplata Lock**: Sit up, isolate arm with legs, press top leg on back, hook bottom leg under armpit
7. **Arm Control**: Pull arm straight with wrist grip, increase shoulder pressure
8. **Hip Shift**: Shift hips further to side to prepare for sweep leverage
9. **Sweep Action**: Roll opponent over trapped shoulder, drive upper body down with legs
10. **Position Consolidation**: Follow through to top position, secure underhook/crossface

### Key Technical Details
Critical elements that determine success:
- **Shoulder Isolation**: Trapping opponent's arm with legs in omoplata position
- **Hip Angle**: Creating perpendicular angle for shoulder control and sweep leverage
- **Posture Disruption**: Breaking opponent's posture to prevent resistance
- **Arm Control**: Maintaining wrist grip to keep arm straight and shoulder vulnerable
- **Follow-Through**: Continuous motion to roll opponent and come up on top

### Success Modifiers
Factors that increase/decrease probability:
- **Shoulder Lock Setup**: Effectiveness of isolating opponent's shoulder (+/-20%)
- **Opponent Posture**: Degree of posture disruption or resistance (+/-15%)
- **Hip Mobility**: Ability to pivot and shift hips dynamically (+/-15%)
- **Arm Control**: Strength of wrist grip and arm straightening (+/-10%)
- **Knowledge Test Performance**: Understanding omoplata mechanics (+/-10%)

## Counter-Attack Analysis

### Common Counters
Opponent responses with success rates:
- **Posture Recovery**: Regaining posture to resist shoulder lock → [[Top Position]] (Success Rate: 40%, Conditions: early recognition)
- **Arm Extraction**: Pulling arm free from omoplata setup → [[Neutral Position]] (Success Rate: 30%, Conditions: strong grip break)
- **Roll Defense**: Rolling with sweep to regain top position → [[Top Position]] (Success Rate: 20%, Conditions: quick reaction)
- **Counter Submission**: Attacking with own submission during setup → [[Submission Control]] (Success Rate: 10%, Conditions: advanced skill)

Format: `[[Counter Technique]] → [[Result State]] (Success Rate: X%, Conditions: [when applicable])`

### Decision Logic
```
If [sweep setup] is recognized early:
- Execute [[Posture Recovery]] (Probability: 40%)

Else if [grip break] can free trapped arm:
- Attempt [[Arm Extraction]] (Probability: 30%)

Else if [roll reaction] can regain top position:
- Execute [[Roll Defense]] (Probability: 20%)

Else [advanced skill] allows counter attack:
- Attempt [[Counter Submission]] (Probability: 10%)

Else [optimal execution]:
- Accept transition (Probability: Success Rate - Modifiers)
```

## Educational Content

### Expert Insights
Commentary as if from recognized authorities:
- **John Danaher**: "The Omoplata Sweep from closed guard is a technique that exemplifies the principle of using joint manipulation to create sweeping opportunities. The key is in isolating the shoulder to undermine their stability while using hip movement to execute the roll, demonstrating how submission setups can transition into positional dominance. This sweep teaches critical principles of joint control and leverage that are essential for advanced guard systems."
- **Gordon Ryan**: "In competition, the Omoplata Sweep is a versatile move from closed guard, especially against opponents who resist traditional sweeps. I focus on securing the shoulder lock setup and driving through the hip pivot to ensure they roll over cleanly. This technique shows how guard sweeps can be adapted into dominant attacks from the bottom with precise control."
- **Eddie Bravo**: "Omoplata Sweep is a slick closed guard sweep that blends submission threat with positional reversal, offering a solid way to gain top position. It’s a great move for grapplers who like to chain attacks and create dynamic sweeps, often transitioning into submissions. This sweep integrates well with systems that prioritize fluid transitions and off-balancing from guard."

Each insight should focus on one key technical or strategic element.

### Common Errors
For knowledge test generation:
- **Error**: Ineffective shoulder isolation or omoplata setup
- **Why It Fails**: Lacks control over opponent's arm, allowing them to resist or extract
- **Correction**: Secure arm tightly between legs, pivot hips to perpendicular angle
- **Recognition**: Opponent easily pulls arm free or maintains posture

- **Error**: Poor hip positioning or insufficient pivot
- **Why It Fails**: Reduces leverage for sweep, making roll difficult
- **Correction**: Shift hips significantly to side, create perpendicular angle to opponent
- **Recognition**: Sweep stalls or opponent resists with base

- **Error**: Weak posture control or lack of arm grip
- **Why It Fails**: Allows opponent to regain posture, countering the setup
- **Correction**: Maintain tight grip on wrist and head/collar to break posture
- **Recognition**: Opponent stands up or resists shoulder lock setup

### Timing Considerations
When to attempt this transition:
- **Optimal Conditions**: When opponent resists traditional sweeps or focuses on posture
- **Avoid When**: Opponent maintains low, wide base with strong arm defense
- **Setup Sequences**: After breaking posture and controlling arm in closed guard
- **Follow-up Windows**: Must complete sweep within 3-5 seconds to avoid counters

- **Technical Skills**: Understanding of closed guard principles and omoplata mechanics
- **Physical Preparation**: Hip mobility and grip strength for control
