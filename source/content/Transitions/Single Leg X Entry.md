## State Properties

- **Position Type**: Offensive transition
- **Risk Level**: Medium
- **Energy Cost**: Medium
- **Time Sustainability**: Short (transitional)

## State Description
Single Leg X Entry represents the critical transitional sequence where a practitioner establishes Single Leg X Guard by entangling one of the opponent's legs with specific leg positioning and control points. Unlike being in the fully established Single Leg X Guard, this entry phase encompasses the dynamic movements and tactical setups needed to achieve the position against resistance. This transition serves as a gateway to the modern leg lock game and powerful sweeping mechanics, making it a cornerstone of contemporary BJJ. Single Leg X Entry can be initiated from numerous positions including open guard variations, defensive scenarios, and even from standing, demonstrating its versatility as a positional pathway.

## Key Principles
- Target and isolate one of opponent's legs
- Create and exploit off-balancing angles
- Establish proper foot positioning on opponent's hip and trapped leg
- Maintain control of opponent's trapped leg at ankle/calf
- Prevent opponent's defensive posturing and pressure
- Time entries with opponent's weight shifts and movements
- Create misdirection to disguise entry intentions
- Maintain defensive awareness during transition phases

## Prerequisites
- Hip mobility and hamstring flexibility
- Understanding of leg positioning and control mechanics
- Basic guard retention skills
- Familiarity with leg entanglement concepts
- Proper framing mechanics

## State Invariants
- Targeting one of opponent's legs
- Active movement toward establishing leg entanglement
- Initial control points on opponent's trapped leg
- Creating angles for successful entry
- Progressive advancement toward full Single Leg X position

## Defensive Responses (When Opponent Has This State)
- [[Defensive Posture]] → [[Standing Base]]
- [[Immediate Pressure]] → [[Leg Entanglement Defense]]
- [[Grip Fighting]] → [[Control Prevention]]
- [[Base and Backstep]] → [[Leg Drag Position]]
- [[Limp Leg and Retreat]] → [[Disengagement]]

## Offensive Transitions (Available From This State)
- [[Complete SLX Control]] → [[Single Leg X Guard]]
- [[Transition to X-Guard]] → [[X-Guard]]
- [[Direct to Ashi Garami]] → [[Ashi Garami]]
- [[SLX Sweep Immediate]] → [[Top Position]]
- [[Technical Stand-up Sweep]] → [[Top Position]]
- [[Reverse X Transition]] → [[Reverse X Guard]]
- [[Butterfly Guard Fallback]] → [[Butterfly Guard]]
- [[Modified De La Riva]] → [[De La Riva Guard]]

## Counter Transitions
- [[Re-entry Attempt]] → [[Single Leg X Entry]] (after failed initial attempt)
- [[Switch Legs]] → [[Single Leg X Entry]] (targeting opposite leg)
- [[Guard Recovery]] → [[Guard Position]] (if entry is fully defended)

## Expert Insights
- **Danaher System**: Emphasizes systematic entry mechanics based on exploiting specific leverage points and weight distribution patterns. Views SLX entry as part of a comprehensive "Lower Body Dilemma" approach where entries create interconnected threats between sweeps and leg entanglements. Focuses on developing precise timing for entries based on the opponent's movement patterns and defensive reactions.
- **Gordon Ryan**: Approaches SLX entries opportunistically within the flow of guard retention and recovery, often using defensive scenarios to create offensive entry opportunities. Creates elaborate setup sequences that disguise the entry intention until the position is nearly secured, using misdirection principles to bypass defensive awareness.
- **Eddie Bravo**: Has incorporated SLX entries within the 10th Planet system as pathways to specialized control positions like the "Honey Hole" (411/saddle). Often initiates entries from unorthodox starting positions including the lockdown and rubber guard variations, departing from traditional entry methods.

## Common Errors
- Telegraphing entry intentions → Defensive countering
- Poor timing with opponent's movement → Failed entries
- Insufficient control of opponent's trapped leg → Defensive escape
- Overcommitting to failed entry attempts → Vulnerability to passes
- Neglecting upper body frames during entry → Smashing pressure
- Improper angle creation → Ineffective entry mechanics
- Incomplete leg positioning → Unstable partial position

## Training Drills
- SLX entry from various guard positions (open, butterfly, half)
- Entry timing drills with progressive resistance
- Transition flows between failed entries and alternatives
- Entry-to-sweep and entry-to-submission combinations
- Defense-to-entry counter drills
- Standing to SLX entry sequences
- Grip fighting to entry progressions

- [[Butterfly Guard]] - Common starting position for many SLX entries

## Decision Tree
If opponent is standing with weight on near leg:
- Execute [[Inside Foot SLX Entry]] → [[Single Leg X Guard]]

Else if opponent is pressuring forward in crouch:
- Execute [[Shin-to-Shin Entry]] → [[Single Leg X Guard]]

Else if opponent is in combat base:
- Execute [[Butterfly Hook to SLX]] → [[Single Leg X Guard]]

Else if opponent has passed partial guard:
- Execute [[Defensive SLX Recovery]] → [[Single Leg X Guard]]

## Position Metrics
- Success Rate: 65% completion (competition data)
- Average Time in Position: 2-8 seconds (transitional)
- SLX Establishment Probability: 65%
- Alternative Guard Transition Probability: 25%
- Failed Entry Probability: 10%

## Optimal Paths
Primary establishment path:
[[Open Guard Bottom]] → [[Single Leg X Entry]] → [[Single Leg X Guard]] → [[SLX Technical Standup Sweep]] → [[Top Position]]

Leg lock-oriented path:
[[Butterfly Guard]] → [[Single Leg X Entry]] → [[Single Leg X Guard]] → [[Direct to Ashi Garami]] → [[Inside Heel Hook]] → [[Won by Submission]]

Modern competition path:
[[Defensive Posture]] → [[Guard Recovery]] → [[Single Leg X Entry]] → [[Single Leg X Guard]] → sweep sequence → passing sequence

## Computer Science Analogy
Single Leg X Entry functions as an "input parser" in the BJJ state machine, converting raw positional data (grips, frames, relative positioning) into a structured format (established SLX) that can be efficiently processed by higher-level routines (sweeps and submissions). This parsing process includes validation checks (proper leg positioning), error handling (dealing with defensive reactions), and data transformation (converting initial control points into the final position). The entry system implements a form of "input sanitization" by filtering out defensive impediments before passing control to the more specialized SLX position logic.
