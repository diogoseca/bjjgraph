## Transition Description
The Single Leg X Entry is an advanced offensive technique in Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu (BJJ) used to transition from a Standing Position or Open Guard to the specialized Single Leg X Guard position. This technique involves isolating one of the opponent's legs with a specific leg entanglement, controlling it with your legs and body to set up sweeps or submissions. It is particularly effective against opponents who are standing or attempting to pass your guard, embodying the BJJ principle of using leg entanglements to control and attack from the bottom. The Single Leg X Entry is a key strategy in modern no-gi and gi grappling, offering a high-percentage method to establish a dynamic guard position with multiple attacking options.

## Visual Execution Sequence
Detailed description for clear visualization of the transition in action:

Starting from a Standing Position or seated in Open Guard, you face your opponent who is standing or on their knees, engaged in grip fighting with sleeve and collar grips in gi or wrist and elbow control in no-gi, as you assess their stance for an opportunity to enter a guard or defend against a pass. To initiate the Single Leg X Entry, you first establish control by securing a grip on their sleeve or wrist with your right hand to manage their upper body, while sitting back if standing or adjusting your hips if already seated, dropping your level to prepare to target their right leg, ensuring you maintain a strong base to avoid being passed or pulled forward. You then shift your hips to angle towards their right side, bringing your left leg across their right shin to hook behind their knee or ankle with your instep, as your right leg frames against their left hip or thigh to block their advance, feeling their balance shift as they react to your leg positioning. With precise timing, you pull them towards you using your grip while simultaneously threading your left leg deeper to lock their right leg in place, elevating your hips slightly to create tension in the entanglement, sensing their posture adjust as they try to step back or stabilize against the control. Mid-transition, you maintain your grip on their upper body to prevent them from posturing up fully, keeping your left leg hooked tightly around their right leg to control it at the knee line, as you adjust your right leg to push against their hip or thigh for distance, ensuring they cannot easily pass or disengage from the guard. You complete the transition by settling into Single Leg X Guard, tightening the entanglement by pulling your left heel towards your hip and keeping your right foot active on their hip to manage space, having successfully established a dynamic guard position with control over their leg. Throughout the movement, you remain aware of their attempts to pass, pull their leg free, or counter with submissions, adjusting your grip strength, hip elevation, and leg tension to counter their defenses, demonstrating an effective offensive guard entry technique that shifts the fight to a specialized bottom position where you can initiate sweeps or leg attacks.

**Template**: "From Standing Position or seated Open Guard, facing opponent standing or on knees, grip fighting with sleeve and collar grips in gi or wrist and elbow control in no-gi, assessing stance for guard entry or pass defense. Establish control, grip sleeve or wrist with right hand for upper body, sit back if standing or adjust hips if seated, drop level to target right leg, maintain strong base. Shift hips to angle right side, bring left leg across right shin to hook behind knee or ankle with instep, right leg frames left hip or thigh to block advance, shift their balance. Pull towards you with grip, thread left leg deeper to lock right leg, elevate hips for tension in entanglement, adjust their posture as they step back or stabilize. Maintain upper body grip mid-transition to prevent posture, keep left leg hooked tight around right leg at knee line, adjust right leg to push hip or thigh for distance, prevent pass or disengagement. Settle into Single Leg X Guard, tighten entanglement by pulling left heel to hip, keep right foot active on hip for space, establish dynamic guard with leg control. Stay aware of pass attempts, leg freeing, or submission counters, adjust grip strength, hip elevation, leg tension to counter, shift fight to specialized bottom position for sweeps or leg attacks."

## Execution Steps
1. Begin in a Standing Position or seated Open Guard, recognizing the opportunity to enter Single Leg X Guard when the opponent's stance exposes a leg or during a guard pass attempt.
2. Establish control by securing a grip on their sleeve or wrist with one hand to manage their upper body, sitting back if standing or adjusting your hips if already seated, dropping your level to prepare for the leg entanglement.
3. Shift your hips to angle towards the targeted side, bringing one leg across their shin to hook behind their knee or ankle with your instep, while your other leg frames against their opposite hip or thigh to block their advance.
4. Pull them towards you using your grip while threading your hooking leg deeper to lock their targeted leg in place, elevating your hips slightly to create tension in the entanglement.
5. Maintain your grip on their upper body during the transition to prevent them from posturing up fully, keeping your hooking leg tight around their leg to control it at the knee line, as you adjust your framing leg to push against their hip or thigh for distance.
6. Complete the transition by settling into Single Leg X Guard, tightening the entanglement by pulling your heel towards your hip and keeping your framing foot active on their hip to manage space.
7. Ensure control over their leg to prevent recovery or passing, preparing for sweeps or submissions from this dynamic guard position.
8. Remain aware of their defensive attempts like passing, freeing their leg, or countering with submissions, adjusting your grip strength, hip elevation, and leg tension to counter and consolidate the guard entry.

## Key Details
- **Hip Angling**: Essential to create the correct angle for leg entanglement.
- **Leg Hooking**: Hook behind knee or ankle with instep for secure control.
- **Framing Leg**: Use opposite leg to block hip or thigh for distance management.
- **Upper Body Grip**: Maintain sleeve or wrist control to limit opponent's posture.
- **Hip Elevation**: Slight lift of hips to create tension in leg entanglement.
- **Knee Line Control**: Secure leg at knee line to prevent escape or counter.
- **Dynamic Adjustment**: Adjust framing and hooking based on opponent's reaction.
- **Defensive Awareness**: Monitor for guard passes or leg freeing attempts.

## Success Modifiers
Factors that influence the success rate of the transition:
- **Timing Precision**: Executing during opponent's stance exposure or pass attempt (+10%)
- **Hip Angling Effectiveness**: Proper hip shift for optimal entanglement angle (+8%)
- **Leg Hook Security**: Strong hook behind knee or ankle to prevent escape (+7%)

## Common Counters and Counter-Attacks
Analysis of opponent responses with success rates for counter-attacks:
- **Leg Freeing** → [[Open Guard Top]] (Success Rate: 35%, Conditions: opponent pulls leg free before entanglement is secure)
- **Guard Pass Attempt** → [[Side Control]] (Success Rate: 30%, Conditions: opponent capitalizes on entry to initiate a pass)
- **Posture Resistance** → [[Standing Guard]] (Success Rate: 25%, Conditions: opponent maintains strong posture and steps back)
- **Counter Sweep** → [[Bottom Position]] (Success Rate: 20%, Conditions: opponent uses your momentum for their own sweep)
- **Submission Threat** → [[Leg Lock Attempt]] (Success Rate: 15%, Conditions: opponent counters with a leg attack during entry)

## Decision Logic for Transition
```
If [opponent stance] exposes leg or during pass attempt:
- Initiate [[Single Leg X Entry]] to establish guard (Probability: 70%)

Else if [scramble situation] offers leg control opportunity:
- Execute [[Single Leg X Entry]] for entanglement (Probability: 65%)

Else if [personal strategy] favors leg attacks or sweeps:
- Attempt [[Single Leg X Entry]] to set up attacks (Probability: 60%)

Else if [opponent resists] with strong posture or leg freeing mid-entry:
- Adjust to [[Open Guard Retention]] for safety (Probability: 50%)

Else if [entry fails] due to pass or submission threat:
- Transition to [[Guard Recovery]] to mitigate (Probability: 40%)
```
