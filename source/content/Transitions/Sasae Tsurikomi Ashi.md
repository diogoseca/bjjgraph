# Sasae Tsurikomi Ashi
#bjj #transition #judo #takedown #standing

## Visual Execution Sequence

From standing neutral position, you establish strong grips on your opponent's collar and sleeve. Your opponent steps forward with their right foot. You simultaneously pull upward with your collar grip (tsurikomi) while blocking their advancing right ankle with the sole of your left foot (sasae). The combination of upward lifting action and ankle block creates a powerful rotational force that sweeps them backward and to their side, landing them on the mat while you maintain control and establish top position.

**One-Sentence Summary**: "From standing grips, you lift and pull your opponent forward while blocking their advancing ankle with your foot sole, sweeping them to the ground."

## Execution Steps

1. **Setup Requirements**: Establish strong grips - right hand on opponent's left collar (high and deep), left hand controlling their right sleeve near elbow. Maintain upright posture and balanced stance.

2. **Initial Movement**: Create forward movement in opponent through pulling action with sleeve grip, causing them to step forward with right foot to maintain balance.

3. **Opponent Response**: Opponent steps forward with right foot to regain balance and resist your pulling pressure, creating the exact moment of vulnerability.

4. **Adaptation**: As opponent's right foot commits forward, time your blocking action to intercept their ankle just as weight transfers onto that foot.

5. **Completion**: Place sole of left foot against opponent's right ankle/lower shin, simultaneously execute strong upward and circular pulling motion with collar grip while pulling sleeve across their body.

6. **Consolidation**: Drive through the throw by continuing pulling motion, following opponent to ground while maintaining grips to establish top position control immediately.

## Key Technical Details

- **Grip Requirements**: High collar grip for maximum lifting power (tsurikomi action), sleeve grip near elbow for directional control and prevention of posting
- **Base/Foundation**: Maintain balance on right leg while left foot becomes blocking tool; weight distribution 70/30 on support leg
- **Timing Windows**: Execute block precisely as opponent's foot plants and weight commits forward; premature or late timing dramatically reduces effectiveness
- **Leverage Points**: Collar grip provides upward lifting force, sleeve grip directs rotation, foot block creates fulcrum at ankle level
- **Common Adjustments**: Adjust blocking foot height based on opponent's stance - lower block for wider stance, higher for narrow stance; vary pulling angle based on opponent's resistance direction

## Common Counters

Opponent defensive responses with success rates and conditions:

- **[[Step Over Block]]** → [[Standing Neutral]] (Success Rate: 40%, Conditions: Opponent recognizes block early and lifts foot over)
- **[[Counter Grip Break]]** → [[Standing Neutral]] (Success Rate: 35%, Conditions: Strong defensive grips prevent effective tsurikomi action)
- **[[Base Widening]]** → [[Standing Neutral]] (Success Rate: 30%, Conditions: Opponent drops weight and widens stance before commitment)
- **[[Forward Roll]]** → [[Scramble Position]] (Success Rate: 25%, Conditions: Advanced opponent uses momentum to roll through)

### Decision Logic for AI Opponent

```
If [setup quality] < 50%:
- Execute [[Counter Grip Break]] (Probability: 35%)

Else if [timing] is telegraphed early:
- Execute [[Step Over Block]] (Probability: 40%)

Else if [opponent has wide stable base]:
- Execute [[Base Widening]] (Probability: 30%)

Else [optimal execution conditions]:
- Accept transition (Probability: Base Success Rate - Applied Modifiers)
```

## Expert Insights

### John Danaher
"Sasae Tsurikomi Ashi exemplifies the principle of combining vertical and horizontal force vectors to create rotational movement that overwhelms the opponent's base. The critical detail is the lifting action - tsurikomi - which must be genuine upward force, not merely pulling. When you lift your opponent onto their advancing foot while simultaneously blocking that foot's forward progress, you create a mechanical impossibility for them to maintain balance. The foot block serves as a fulcrum around which the rotational force operates. In training, focus on the coordination of three elements: the upward lift, the circular pull, and the precise timing of the ankle block."

### Gordon Ryan
"In no-gi grappling, this technique adapts beautifully because the mechanical principles remain constant even without gi grips. I use collar ties and overhooks to create the same lifting and pulling actions. The key in competition is recognizing the exact moment when your opponent commits their weight forward - that's your window. If you time it perfectly, they have zero chance of recovery because you're using their own forward momentum against them. The throw happens almost instantly if your timing is right. In training, drill the sensitivity to feel when their weight shifts forward - that tactile feedback is what separates consistent execution from random success."

### Eddie Bravo
"What I love about this technique is how it fits into a systematic approach to standup. In the 10th Planet system, we teach students to chain standing techniques together, and sasae tsurikomi ashi works perfectly as part of combination sequences. If your opponent defends by stepping back or widening their base, you can immediately transition to other attacks. The beauty is in creating dilemmas - if they resist your pull, they're vulnerable to forward throws; if they push back, they create the perfect setup for this technique. Don't think of it as an isolated throw - it's part of an attacking system that forces your opponent into bad choices."

## Common Errors

### Error 1: Blocking with toes instead of sole of foot
- **Why It Fails**: Toes provide weak, unstable contact point that opponent can easily push through or step over
- **Correction**: Use entire sole of foot with foot flexed, creating broad, stable blocking surface against opponent's ankle/shin
- **Recognition**: Throw attempts fail with opponent easily continuing forward motion through weak block

### Error 2: Pulling horizontally without upward lifting component
- **Why It Fails**: Horizontal pull alone allows opponent to maintain base by posting or widening stance
- **Correction**: Execute genuine upward lifting motion (tsurikomi) with collar grip, bringing opponent onto toes of blocked foot
- **Recognition**: Opponent maintains balance and posture despite pulling effort

### Error 3: Blocking foot placement too early
- **Why It Fails**: Opponent recognizes block before weight commits, allowing them to adjust step or lift foot over block
- **Correction**: Time block to intercept ankle exactly as foot plants and weight transfers forward
- **Recognition**: Opponent easily steps over or around blocking foot

### Error 4: Insufficient commitment to throwing motion
- **Why It Fails**: Partial effort allows opponent time to react and establish defensive base
- **Correction**: Fully commit to coordinated pulling, lifting, and blocking action with explosive timing
- **Recognition**: Technique execution feels weak or tentative, opponent has time to defend

### Error 5: Poor grip control
- **Why It Fails**: Weak grips prevent effective force transmission, especially upward lifting component
- **Correction**: Establish deep, high collar grip and firm sleeve control before initiating throw
- **Recognition**: Grips slip or break during execution, reducing technique effectiveness

## Timing Considerations

- **Optimal Conditions**: Opponent moving forward with committed step, grips securely established, opponent's weight shifting onto advancing foot
- **Avoid When**: Opponent has extremely wide or low defensive stance, opponent moving backward away from you, grips compromised or broken
- **Setup Sequences**: After failed forward throws (Uchi Mata, Harai Goshi) when opponent defends by stepping back, after grip fighting exchanges when opponent steps forward to re-engage
- **Follow-up Windows**: Must secure top position within 1-2 seconds of completion to prevent opponent's defensive recovery

## Prerequisites

- **Technical Skills**: Basic judo gripping fundamentals, understanding of kuzushi (off-balancing), coordinated upper and lower body movement
- **Physical Preparation**: Single-leg balance for support leg, ankle flexibility for blocking foot positioning, core strength for rotational pulling
- **Positional Understanding**: Standing neutral position mechanics, grip control principles, timing awareness for opponent's weight shifts
- **Experience Level**: Intermediate - requires coordination and timing sense beyond beginner capabilities

5. **Adaptation**: "How do you adjust if opponent steps over your blocking foot?"
   - A) Force the block harder
   - B) Give up and reset
   - C) Switch to different technique or maintain grips for next opportunity
   - D) Pull opponent backward
   - **Answer**: C

## Variants and Adaptations

- **Gi Specific**: Traditional gripping provides maximum control - high collar grip enables powerful tsurikomi action, sleeve grip prevents posting hand
- **No-Gi Specific**: Adapt to collar tie (hand behind head) and underhook or overhook control; mechanical principles remain identical but grips require adjustment
- **Self-Defense**: Highly effective for creating distance and establishing dominant position quickly in street confrontation
- **Competition**: Excellent scoring technique in judo competition (ippon when executed with control); in BJJ competition, secures takedown points and top position
- **Size Differential**: Smaller practitioners can leverage superior timing and technique to overcome size disadvantage; minimal strength required when timing is precise

## Training Progressions

1. **Solo Practice**: Practice blocking foot motion and pulling mechanics without partner to develop coordination and balance on support leg
2. **Cooperative Drilling**: Partner provides forward step with zero resistance, allowing focus on timing and coordination of three elements (lift, pull, block)
3. **Resistant Practice**: Partner provides progressive resistance and defensive reactions, requiring adaptation and timing refinement
4. **Sparring Integration**: Implement technique during standing exchanges in live training, recognizing opportunity moments and executing under pressure
5. **Troubleshooting**: Identify common failure points during live training - typically timing of block or quality of tsurikomi action - and address through focused drilling

### Common Troubleshooting Patterns

```yaml
troubleshooting:
  - symptom: "Opponent maintains balance despite blocking foot"
    likely_cause: "Insufficient upward lifting (tsurikomi) component in collar grip"
    diagnostic_questions:
      - "Is collar grip high and deep?"
      - "Are you pulling upward as well as circularly?"
      - "Is opponent being lifted onto toes of blocked foot?"
    solution: "Emphasize genuine upward lifting motion with collar grip before circular pull; opponent should feel lifted"

  - symptom: "Blocking foot misses opponent's ankle"
    likely_cause: "Timing too early or too late relative to opponent's step"
    diagnostic_questions:
      - "Are you blocking before foot lands?"
      - "Are you waiting until after weight is committed?"
      - "Can you feel opponent's weight shifting forward?"
    solution: "Refine timing to intercept ankle exactly as foot plants; develop sensitivity to opponent's weight transfer"

  - symptom: "Opponent steps over or around blocking foot"
    likely_cause: "Telegraphing throw intention or blocking too early"
    diagnostic_questions:
      - "Is blocking motion visible before execution?"
      - "Are grips pulling opponent forward convincingly?"
      - "Is blocking foot placed before opponent commits weight?"
    solution: "Hide blocking motion until last moment; ensure forward pulling creates genuine step response"

## Competition Applications

- **IBJJF Rules**: Legal takedown at all belt levels, scores 2 points for sweep/takedown when executed with control
- **No-Gi Competition**: Requires grip adaptation (collar ties, overhooks) but mechanical principles remain effective
- **Self-Defense Context**: Highly effective for creating immediate distance and establishing dominant position
- **MMA Applications**: Can be adapted with cage positioning considerations, effective for establishing top position in MMA context

## Historical Context

Sasae Tsurikomi Ashi is a classical judo technique from the Kodokan Gokyo no Waza (40 throws categorized by Jigoro Kano). Originally classified as a foot technique (ashi-waza), it has been successfully adapted to Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu standing game, where the emphasis on grip control and transition to ground positions aligns perfectly with BJJ strategic objectives.

## Safety Considerations

- **Controlled Application**: Maintain grips throughout throw to control opponent's landing and prevent injury
- **Mat Awareness**: Ensure adequate space for safe completion of throw without obstacles
- **Partner Safety**: Control descent to mat, preventing hard impact or uncontrolled landing
- **Gradual Progression**: Build up speed and power gradually during learning phase; focus on timing before adding power

## Position Integration

**Common combinations and sequences:**
- [[Standing Neutral]] → [[Sasae Tsurikomi Ashi]] → [[Top Position Ground]]
- [[Standing Neutral]] → [[Sasae Tsurikomi Ashi]] → [[Failed Throw Recovery]] (if defended)
- [[Standing Neutral]] → [[Failed Forward Throw]] → [[Sasae Tsurikomi Ashi]] (combination sequence)
