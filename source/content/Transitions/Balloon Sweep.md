## State Machine Content Elements

### Visual Execution Sequence
Detailed step-by-step description for clear movement sequence visualization:

From closed guard bottom, you establish a cross-collar grip with one hand while your other hand controls their same-side sleeve. Your opponent typically maintains their posture or attempts to establish grips. You then bring both knees up toward your chest, creating space while maintaining grip control, before explosively extending your legs upward and over their head like inflating a balloon. The upward leg motion combined with grip pulling creates a powerful sweeping force that launches them over your body as you follow through, ending up in mount position with control established.

**Template**: "From closed guard with cross-collar and sleeve grips, you bring knees to chest then explosively extend legs upward over their head while pulling with grips. Your opponent is launched over you as you follow through to mount position."

### Execution Steps (Numbered Sequence)
1. **Setup Requirements**: Establish cross-collar grip and same-side sleeve control from closed guard
2. **Initial Movement**: Bring both knees up toward chest while maintaining grip control
3. **Opponent Response**: Opponent typically tries to maintain base or adjust their posture
4. **Adaptation**: Adjust timing and grip tension based on their balance and reaction
5. **Completion**: Explosively extend legs upward and over their head while pulling with grips
6. **Consolidation**: Follow through by rolling over opponent to secure mount position

### Key Technical Details
Critical elements that determine success:
- **Grip Requirements**: Strong cross-collar grip, tight sleeve control on same side
- **Base/Foundation**: Proper knee positioning and hip mobility for balloon motion
- **Timing Windows**: Execute when opponent's weight is forward or they're adjusting
- **Leverage Points**: Upward leg extension combined with grip pulling creates sweep
- **Common Adjustments**: Vary leg extension angle and grip pulling direction based on resistance

### Success Modifiers
Factors that increase/decrease probability:
- **Setup Quality**: Deep grips and proper knee positioning (+/-15%)
- **Timing Precision**: Executing during optimal weight distribution (+/-20%)
- **Opponent Fatigue**: Reduced defensive reactions and balance (+/-5%)
- **Knowledge Test Performance**: Understanding sweep mechanics (+/-10%)
- **Position Control**: Quality of closed guard maintenance (+/-10%)

## Counter-Attack Analysis

### Common Counters
Opponent responses with success rates:
- **Heavy Base**: Dropping weight down to prevent lift → [[Closed Guard Top]] (Success Rate: 55%, Conditions: early recognition)
- **Grip Break**: Breaking collar or sleeve grip to neutralize → [[Open Guard]] (Success Rate: 50%, Conditions: superior grip fighting)
- **Forward Drive**: Driving forward to collapse guard before sweep → [[Guard Pass]] (Success Rate: 45%, Conditions: timing dependent)
- **Post and Sprawl**: Posting hands and sprawling to prevent rollover → [[Top Position]] (Success Rate: 40%, Conditions: athletic ability)

Format: `[[Counter Technique]] → [[Result State]] (Success Rate: X%, Conditions: [when applicable])`

### Decision Logic
```
If [balloon setup] is telegraphed early:
- Execute [[Heavy Base]] (Probability: 55%)

Else if [grips are not deep]:
- Execute [[Grip Break]] (Probability: 50%)

Else if [sweep timing] can be countered:
- Execute [[Forward Drive]] (Probability: 45%)

Else [optimal sweep execution]:
- Accept transition (Probability: Success Rate - Modifiers)
```

## Educational Content

### Expert Insights
Commentary as if from recognized authorities:
- **John Danaher**: "The balloon sweep succeeds through precise coordination of grip control and explosive leg extension. The key is understanding that the upward motion must be perfectly timed with the grip pulling - the balloon analogy helps students visualize the lifting and expanding motion required. Most practitioners fail by rushing the setup without proper grip establishment."
- **Gordon Ryan**: "In competition, the balloon sweep is particularly effective against opponents who maintain forward pressure in guard. I use it when opponents are defensive but still applying pressure, as their forward momentum aids in the sweep completion. The follow-through to mount is crucial for immediate point scoring."
- **Eddie Bravo**: "The balloon sweep integrates well with rubber guard concepts, especially when transitioning from mission control positions. It can be modified with different grip variations and works exceptionally well in gi competition where deep collar grips are available. The explosive nature makes it difficult to defend once initiated."

Each insight should focus on one key technical or strategic element.

### Common Errors
For knowledge test generation:
- **Error**: Attempting sweep without proper grip establishment
- **Why It Fails**: Lack of control allows opponent to easily defend and counter
- **Correction**: Always secure deep cross-collar and sleeve grips before initiating
- **Recognition**: Opponent easily maintains balance during sweep attempt

- **Error**: Bringing knees up too slowly or telegraphing the movement
- **Why It Fails**: Gives opponent time to prepare defensive measures
- **Correction**: Make knee movement smooth and coordinated with grip adjustments
- **Recognition**: Opponent easily drops weight or adjusts before leg extension

- **Error**: Not extending legs explosively enough during balloon phase
- **Why It Fails**: Insufficient force to overcome opponent's base and balance
- **Correction**: Focus on explosive upward leg extension like inflating a balloon
- **Recognition**: Sweep feels weak or opponent doesn't move significantly

### Timing Considerations
When to attempt this transition:
- **Optimal Conditions**: When opponent has forward pressure but is slightly off-balance
- **Avoid When**: Opponent has heavy base with defensive posture
- **Setup Sequences**: After failed submission attempts that bring opponent forward
- **Follow-up Windows**: Must complete explosive extension within 1-2 seconds

### Prerequisites
Requirements before attempting:
- **Technical Skills**: Basic closed guard control and advanced grip fighting
- **Physical Preparation**: Hip flexibility and explosive leg strength
- **Positional Understanding**: Closed guard mechanics and sweep principles
- **Experience Level**: Intermediate technique requiring coordination and timing

## Technical Assessment Elements

### Knowledge Assessment Questions
5 technical questions with multiple choice answers:
- **Mechanical Understanding**: "What creates the sweeping force in the balloon sweep?"
- **Timing Recognition**: "When is the optimal moment to execute the leg extension?"
- **Error Prevention**: "What is the most common setup mistake?"
- **Setup Requirements**: "Which grip combination is essential for proper execution?"
- **Adaptation**: "How do you adjust if opponent drops heavy base during setup?"

### Variants and Adaptations
