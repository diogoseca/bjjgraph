## Transition Description
Transition to Omoplata is a sophisticated offensive technique in Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu (BJJ) used to set up a submission from a bottom guard position like Closed Guard Bottom or Open Guard Bottom, targeting the opponent's shoulder with the Omoplata Control or Submission Setup. This technique involves isolating an opponent's arm and using leg and hip movement to spin into a position that threatens a shoulder lock, effectively turning a defensive guard into an attacking opportunity. It is particularly effective against opponents who overextend their arms or posture aggressively in your guard, embodying the BJJ principle of using leverage and angles to attack from inferior positions. Transition to Omoplata is a key strategy in both gi and no-gi grappling, offering a high-skill method to transition from guard to a dominant submission threat with fluid, technical movement.

## Visual Execution Sequence
Detailed description for clear visualization of the transition in action:

Starting from Closed Guard Bottom or Open Guard Bottom, you are on your back with your opponent in your guard, controlling their posture with grips on their collar or sleeves in gi or wrists in no-gi, as you remain alert for their arm positioning and posture breaks while maintaining active legs to prevent passes or standing attempts. As you initiate the Transition to Omoplata, you isolate one of their arms by pulling it across your body with a strong two-on-one grip, breaking their posture further if in Closed Guard by pulling with your legs, or creating an angle in Open Guard by shifting your hips to the side, preparing to trap their arm between your legs while keeping your other hand ready to control their reaction. You begin the transition by swinging one leg over their trapped arm, feeling their resistance as they attempt to pull their arm back or posture up, using your hips to pivot and spin your body perpendicular to theirs, placing your leg over their shoulder with the trapped arm bent at the elbow, ensuring their wrist is secured near your hip. With precise timing, you adjust your position to lock the Omoplata by sitting up slightly, sensing their reaction as they either try to roll out, posture to escape, or attack with their free arm, while you control their trapped arm tightly with your legs and grip, keeping your other leg posted or hooked to prevent them from standing or rolling easily. Mid-transition, you maintain control by keeping your hips elevated to apply pressure on their shoulder, adjusting your angle to counter their movements, as you position yourself to fully establish Omoplata Control by securing their arm and torso, or prepare for a Submission Setup if they resist the initial lock. You complete the Transition to Omoplata by locking in the Omoplata Control, applying pressure to their shoulder by leaning forward or extending your legs, or transitioning to a direct Submission Setup like finishing the shoulder lock or chaining to other attacks, having successfully turned your guard into a threatening submission position with technical precision. Throughout the movement, you remain aware of their defensive responses like rolling escapes, posture breaks, or guard passes, adjusting your grip tightness, hip angle, and leg positioning to counter their efforts, demonstrating an effective offensive technique that transforms a bottom position into a dominant submission threat.

**Template**: "From Closed Guard Bottom or Open Guard Bottom, on back with opponent in guard, control posture with grips on collar or sleeves in gi or wrists in no-gi, alert for arm positioning and posture breaks, maintain active legs to prevent passes or standing. Initiate Transition to Omoplata by isolating arm, pull across body with two-on-one grip, break posture further in Closed Guard by pulling with legs, or create angle in Open Guard by shifting hips to side, prepare to trap arm between legs, keep other hand ready to control reaction. Swing one leg over trapped arm, feel resistance as they pull arm back or posture up, use hips to pivot, spin body perpendicular, place leg over shoulder with trapped arm bent at elbow, secure wrist near hip. Adjust position with precise timing to lock Omoplata by sitting up slightly, sense reaction as they roll out, posture to escape, or attack with free arm, control trapped arm tightly with legs and grip, keep other leg posted or hooked to prevent standing or rolling. Maintain control mid-transition by keeping hips elevated for shoulder pressure, adjust angle to counter movements, position for Omoplata Control by securing arm and torso or prepare Submission Setup if resisted. Complete Transition to Omoplata by locking Omoplata Control, apply shoulder pressure by leaning forward or extending legs, or transition to direct Submission Setup like finishing shoulder lock or chaining attacks, turn guard into threatening submission with technical precision. Stay aware of defensive responses like rolling escapes, posture breaks, or guard passes, adjust grip tightness, hip angle, leg positioning to counter, transform bottom position into dominant submission threat."

## Execution Steps
1. Begin in Closed Guard Bottom or Open Guard Bottom, maintaining awareness of the opponent's arm positioning and posture, identifying an opportunity to isolate an arm while keeping active legs to control their movement.
2. Isolate one of their arms by pulling it across your body with a strong two-on-one grip, breaking their posture further in Closed Guard with leg pulls, or creating an angle in Open Guard by shifting your hips to the side.
3. Initiate the transition by swinging one leg over their trapped arm, pivoting your hips to spin your body perpendicular to theirs, placing your leg over their shoulder with the arm bent at the elbow and wrist near your hip.
4. Lock the Omoplata by sitting up slightly, adjusting your position to counter their resistance like pulling the arm back or posturing up, while controlling the trapped arm tightly with your legs and grip.
5. Maintain control during the transition by keeping your hips elevated to apply pressure on their shoulder, using your other leg to post or hook to prevent them from standing or rolling easily.
6. Secure the full Omoplata Control by tightening your legs around their arm and torso, applying pressure to their shoulder by leaning forward or extending your legs, ensuring their movement is restricted.
7. Complete the Transition to Omoplata by either finishing the shoulder lock in Omoplata Control or preparing a Submission Setup by chaining to other attacks if they resist, having turned your guard into a submission threat.
8. Remain aware of their defensive responses like rolling escapes or guard passes, adapting your grip tightness, hip angle, and leg positioning to consolidate the submission position.

## Key Details
- **Arm Isolation**: Essential to trap one arm across body for setup.
- **Hip Pivot**: Spin body perpendicular using hip movement for angle.
- **Leg Placement**: Swing leg over shoulder to lock arm in position.
- **Posture Control**: Break opponent's posture to facilitate transition.
- **Shoulder Pressure**: Elevate hips to apply submission threat.
- **Control Grip**: Secure wrist near hip to prevent arm withdrawal.
- **Counter Prevention**: Use other leg to block rolling or standing escapes.
- **Offensive Awareness**: Monitor for guard passes or submission counters.

## Success Modifiers
Factors that influence the success rate of the transition:
- **Arm Control**: Secure two-on-one grip to isolate arm effectively (+10%)
- **Timing Precision**: Attacking at optimal moment of posture break (+8%)
- **Hip Mobility**: Quick pivot to create perpendicular angle (+7%)

- **Experience Level**: Familiarity with submission transitions (+5% per skill level)

## Common Counters and Counter-Attacks
Analysis of opponent responses with success rates for counter-attacks:
- **Roll Escape** → [[Guard Recovery]] (Success Rate: 30%, Conditions: opponent rolls forward to escape shoulder pressure)
- **Posture Break** → [[Open Guard Top]] (Success Rate: 25%, Conditions: opponent postures up to withdraw arm before lock)
- **Guard Pass** → [[Side Control]] (Success Rate: 20%, Conditions: opponent uses transition to initiate pass)
- **Submission Counter** → [[Straight Ankle Lock]] (Success Rate: 15%, Conditions: opponent attacks exposed leg during spin)
- **Arm Withdrawal** → [[Closed Guard Top]] (Success Rate: 10%, Conditions: opponent pulls arm free before Omoplata is locked)

## Decision Logic for Transition
```
If [opponent's arm] is overextended or posture is broken:
- Initiate [[Transition to Omoplata]] to attack shoulder (Probability: 55%)

Else if [scramble situation] offers arm isolation opportunity:
- Execute [[Transition to Omoplata]] for submission setup (Probability: 50%)

Else if [personal strategy] favors submission over position:
- Attempt [[Transition to Omoplata]] to threaten from guard (Probability: 45%)

Else if [opponent counters] with strong roll or posture mid-transition:
- Adjust to [[Triangle Control]] for alternative attack (Probability: 35%)

Else if [transition fails] due to successful guard pass or arm withdrawal:
- Transition to [[Guard Retention]] to mitigate (Probability: 30%)
```
