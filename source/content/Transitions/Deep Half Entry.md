# Deep Half Entry
#bjj #transition #half-guard #deep-half

## Visual Execution Sequence

From half guard bottom, you release your outside leg hook and swim your inside arm deep under opponent's trapped leg. You scoot your hips toward their trapped leg side while turning your body perpendicular, getting your head to their hip. You thread your outside leg over their back and lock your feet together behind their far leg. Your shoulders are now under their hips with their weight above you, establishing deep half guard with control of their trapped leg.

**One-Sentence Summary**: "From half guard, swim arm under their leg, scoot hips and turn perpendicular, establishing deep half with shoulders under their hips."

## Execution Steps

1. **Setup Requirements**: Establish half guard with inside position, control opponent's weight forward, create space for entry
2. **Initial Movement**: Release outside leg, swim inside arm deep under their trapped leg to waist level
3. **Opponent Response**: They typically try to sprawl, push head away, or transition to different position
4. **Adaptation**: Scoot hips quickly toward their trapped leg, turn shoulders perpendicular under their hips
5. **Completion**: Thread outside leg over their back, lock feet together behind far leg, secure position
6. **Consolidation**: Control trapped leg tightly, adjust position for sweeps, maintain head position near hip

## Key Technical Details

- **Grip Requirements**: Inside arm swims deep under trapped leg, outside hand can control ankle or pants
- **Base/Foundation**: Turn shoulders perpendicular, head near hip, weight on shoulders and upper back
- **Timing Windows**: Execute when opponent drives weight forward, during transitions, or when they stand
- **Leverage Points**: Shoulders under hips lift their weight, trapped leg control prevents escape
- **Common Adjustments**: If they sprawl, continue scooting; if they push head, use momentum to enter deeper

## Common Counters

Opponent defensive responses with success rates and conditions:

- **[[Sprawl and Flatten]]** → [[Half Guard Top]] (Success Rate: 45%, Conditions: sprawls immediately preventing entry)
- **[[Push Head Away]]** → [[Cross Face Control]] (Success Rate: 40%, Conditions: crossfaces and drives pressure)
- **[[Step Over to Mount]]** → [[Mount]] (Success Rate: 35%, Conditions: uses entry attempt to establish mount)
- **[[Whizzer Control]]** → [[Half Guard Top]] (Success Rate: 50%, Conditions: overhooks entering arm preventing full entry)

## Expert Insights

### John Danaher
"Deep half guard entry requires understanding that you're temporarily accepting a more vulnerable position to access a system with excellent sweeping mechanics. The key is the shoulder positioning - your shoulders must get under their center of gravity. Once achieved, you control their base completely despite appearing to be underneath them."

### Gordon Ryan
"Deep half is one of my favorite positions because opponents don't expect the sweeps. The entry requires timing - you need them driving forward or standing up. If they're heavy on you in regular half guard, the entry opens up naturally. Once I'm under, they have almost no base and the sweeps are inevitable."

### Eddie Bravo
"This is fundamental in the 10th Planet system. Deep half connects with lockdown and leads to multiple sweeps. The entry is all about getting your shoulders under their hips - once you're there, you can sweep them in any direction. We drill this constantly because it's such a powerful position."

## Common Errors

### Error 1: Not Swimming Arm Deep Enough
- **Why It Fails**: Shallow underhook doesn't create proper angle, easy to defend
- **Correction**: Swim arm all the way to their waist, get deep underhook on trapped leg
- **Recognition**: They easily prevent entry by pushing your shoulder - arm wasn't deep enough

### Error 2: Forgetting to Scoot Hips
- **Why It Fails**: Without hip movement, shoulders don't get under their center of gravity
- **Correction**: Scoot hips aggressively toward trapped leg side while turning perpendicular
- **Recognition**: You're trying to enter but can't get under them - hips didn't move

### Error 3: Slow Entry
- **Why It Fails**: Gives opponent time to sprawl or counter
- **Correction**: Explosive entry once opportunity presents, commit fully to the movement
- **Recognition**: They consistently defend because you're too slow or hesitant

## Timing Considerations

- **Optimal Conditions**: When opponent drives weight forward, when they attempt to pass, when they stand up in half guard
- **Avoid When**: Opponent is perfectly flat with low base, when they have strong whizzer or crossface
- **Setup Sequences**: After lockdown control, after threatening old school sweep, during their passing attempts
- **Follow-up Windows**: Must secure position within 2-3 seconds or they may escape or establish mount

## Prerequisites

- **Technical Skills**: Half guard fundamentals, deep half guard sweeps, hip movement and scooting
- **Physical Preparation**: Shoulder flexibility for getting under, hip mobility for scooting, core strength
- **Positional Understanding**: Half guard mechanics, deep half guard system, sweep mechanics
- **Experience Level**: Intermediate - requires good timing and flexibility

## Knowledge Assessment

1. **Mechanical Understanding**: "What creates the entry opportunity for deep half?"
   - A) Pure speed
   - B) Swimming arm deep under leg while scooting hips and turning perpendicular
   - C) Opponent cooperation
   - D) Strength alone
   - **Answer**: B

2. **Timing Recognition**: "When is the optimal moment to enter deep half?"
   - A) When opponent is perfectly flat
   - B) When they drive weight forward or stand up
   - C) When you're tired
   - D) Randomly anytime
   - **Answer**: B

3. **Error Prevention**: "What is the most common mistake in deep half entry?"
   - A) Moving too fast
   - B) Not swimming arm deep enough and not scooting hips
   - C) Having too much flexibility
   - D) Entering too easily
   - **Answer**: B

4. **Setup Requirements**: "What position must shoulders achieve in deep half?"
   - A) Above opponent
   - B) Next to opponent
   - C) Under opponent's center of gravity/hips
   - D) Behind opponent
   - **Answer**: C

5. **Adaptation**: "How should you adjust if opponent sprawls during entry?"
   - A) Give up immediately
   - B) Continue scooting and getting deeper, use their sprawl momentum
   - C) Just wait
   - D) Switch to top position
   - **Answer**: B

## Variants and Adaptations

- **Gi Specific**: Can grip pants at ankle for additional control, use gi fabric to maintain position
- **No-Gi Specific**: Control leg directly with underhook and lockdown, requires tighter position due to less friction
- **Self-Defense**: Lower priority in self-defense due to vulnerability to strikes from top
- **Competition**: High-percentage sweep position, works well in gi and no-gi competition
- **Size Differential**: Works well for smaller grapplers against larger opponents, flexibility advantage helps

## Training Progressions

1. **Solo Practice**: Practice hip scooting motion, work on flexibility for shoulder positioning
2. **Cooperative Drilling**: Partner allows entry, focus on mechanics and position establishment
3. **Resistant Practice**: Partner defends with 50-75% resistance, practice timing and commitment
4. **Sparring Integration**: Execute during live rolling from half guard, chain with sweeps
5. **Troubleshooting**: Identify entry failures, improve hip movement and arm swim depth

## Position Integration

**Common combinations and sequences:**
- [[Half Guard Bottom]] → [[Deep Half Entry]] → [[Deep Half Guard]]
- [[Half Guard Bottom]] → [[Deep Half Entry]] → [[Waiter Sweep]] → [[Top Position]]
- [[Half Guard Bottom]] → [[Deep Half Entry]] → [[Old School Sweep]] (if they defend)
