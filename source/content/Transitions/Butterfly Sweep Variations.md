# Butterfly Sweep Variations

## Visual Execution Sequence

From butterfly guard with hooks under opponent's thighs, you have multiple sweeping options based on their weight distribution and grip positioning. You can lift and roll them directly with a traditional butterfly sweep, or use arm drags to create angles for sweeps, or attack with underhook-based sweeps when they're heavy. Each variation reads their defense and pressure differently - if they're light, lift and roll; if they're heavy, use their weight against them; if they're square, create angles. The common thread is using your butterfly hooks as off-balancing levers while your upper body controls and directs the sweep.

**One-Sentence Summary**: "From butterfly guard, multiple sweep variations use hooks as levers combined with different upper body controls to off-balance opponent based on their positioning."

## Execution Steps

1. **Setup Requirements**: Establish butterfly guard with hooks in; secure appropriate grips based on situation; assess opponent's weight distribution
2. **Initial Movement**: Choose variation based on opponent's positioning - traditional lift, arm drag angle, or underhook control
3. **Opponent Response**: Opponent attempts to base out, change posture, or counter with pressure
4. **Adaptation**: Switch between variations fluidly as their defense changes; chain sweeps together
5. **Completion**: Complete selected sweep variation; follow to top position
6. **Consolidation**: Establish mount, side control, or other dominant top position; secure control

## Key Technical Details

- **Grip Requirements**: Vary by variation - overhooks, underhooks, arm drags, collar ties, or wrist control
- **Base/Foundation**: Butterfly hooks provide lifting leverage; seated position allows mobility
- **Timing Windows**: Read opponent's weight distribution; attack when they're committed to direction
- **Leverage Points**: Hooks lift under thighs; upper body creates directional control
- **Common Adjustments**: Switch between variations based on defense; chain techniques together

## Expert Insights

### John Danaher
"The power of butterfly guard sweeps lies in the system, not individual techniques. Each sweep creates defensive reactions that open other sweeps. If they base out against the basic butterfly sweep, that creates the arm drag opportunity. If they pressure heavy to prevent the lift, that creates the underhook sweep. Understanding the connections between variations transforms butterfly guard from a collection of techniques into a systematic attacking platform."

### Gordon Ryan
"My butterfly guard has so many different sweeps that opponents can't commit to defending any single one. They have to stay square and balanced, which means they can't effectively pass or establish control. I'm constantly threatening - lift, arm drag, underhook, repeat. The moment they make a mistake, I sweep. It's about creating a guessing game where every guess wrong costs them the position."

### Eddie Bravo
"Butterfly guard is awesome for no-gi because the sweeps don't rely on gi grips. I teach the variations as a flow - you're never stuck on one technique. Feel them base out? Arm drag. Feel them drive pressure? Use it to roll them. Feel them sit back? Traditional lift. It's all reading and reacting, but from a position where you have multiple weapons available instantly."

## Common Errors

### Error 1: Committing to One Sweep Against Defense
- **Why It Fails**: If opponent defends specific sweep, forcing it wastes energy and positioning
- **Correction**: Read their defense; flow to different variation that attacks their defensive posture
- **Recognition**: Struggling against their basing; feeling stuck in one pattern

### Error 2: Weak Hook Position
- **Why It Fails**: Shallow hooks under thighs don't provide adequate lift leverage
- **Correction**: Ensure hooks are deep under thighs; feet actively lifting
- **Recognition**: Lifting action feels weak; opponent easily maintains base

### Error 3: Upper Body Not Coordinated With Hooks
- **Why It Fails**: Hooks alone don't sweep; need upper body to control direction
- **Correction**: Coordinate hook lift with arm pull/push in sweep direction
- **Recognition**: Opponent tips but recovers; no directional control

## Timing Considerations

- **Optimal Conditions**: When opponent is in butterfly guard; during their weight shifts or adjustments
- **Avoid When**: Opponent has strong frames established; their base is very wide and low
- **Setup Sequences**: After opening closed guard; following guard transitions; during opponent's passing attempts
- **Follow-up Windows**: Must follow sweep immediately to prevent opponent recovering

## Prerequisites

- **Technical Skills**: Butterfly guard maintenance; hook placement; sweep mechanics; upper body control
- **Physical Preparation**: Core strength for sit-up position; hip flexibility; coordination
- **Positional Understanding**: Butterfly guard principles; base destruction concepts; top position establishment
- **Experience Level**: Intermediate; requires understanding of multiple variations and connections

## Knowledge Assessment

1. **Mechanical Understanding**: "What makes butterfly sweep variations effective?"
   - A) Only the hooks
   - B) System of connected sweeps that create defensive dilemmas
   - C) Pure strength
   - D) Speed alone
   - **Answer**: B

2. **Timing Recognition**: "When should you switch between butterfly sweep variations?"
   - A) Never - commit to one
   - B) When opponent's defense makes current sweep difficult
   - C) Randomly
   - D) After the sweep fails completely
   - **Answer**: B

3. **Error Prevention**: "What is the most common mistake with butterfly sweeps?"
   - A) Having too many variations
   - B) Committing to one sweep against specific defense
   - C) Using hooks
   - D) Having too much control
   - **Answer**: B

4. **Setup Requirements**: "What must be coordinated for effective butterfly sweeps?"
   - A) Only hooks
   - B) Only upper body
   - C) Hook lift with directional upper body control
   - D) Neither hooks nor upper body
   - **Answer**: C

5. **Adaptation**: "If opponent bases out strongly against traditional butterfly sweep, what should you do?"
   - A) Force the sweep harder
   - B) Give up completely
   - C) Switch to arm drag or alternative variation
   - D) Close guard
   - **Answer**: C

## Variants and Adaptations

- **Gi Specific**: Can use collar and sleeve grips for enhanced control
- **No-Gi Specific**: Relies on body grips and hooks; very effective without gi
- **Self-Defense**: Quick reversals from bottom position
- **Competition**: Multiple attacking options create point-scoring opportunities
- **Size Differential**: Smaller practitioners excel with technical hook placement; larger add power

## Training Progressions

1. **Solo Practice**: Practice hook placement and hip movement
2. **Cooperative Drilling**: Partner allows sweeps to learn each variation
3. **Resistant Practice**: Partner provides realistic defense; practice switching variations
4. **Sparring Integration**: Use butterfly sweep system in live rolling
5. **Troubleshooting**: Identify which variations work against which defenses
