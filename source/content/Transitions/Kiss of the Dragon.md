- **Energy Cost**: High - requires significant effort for hip movement and control
- **Transition Type**: Offensive Reversal

## Transition Description
The Kiss of the Dragon is an advanced sweep technique in Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu (BJJ) primarily executed from the bottom Half Guard position. Popularized by practitioners like Eddie Bravo within the 10th Planet system, this move involves a dynamic hip switch and leg entanglement to off-balance and reverse an opponent, transitioning from a defensive guard position to a dominant top position. It is particularly effective against opponents who apply heavy top pressure in Half Guard, using their own weight and momentum against them. The technique showcases BJJ's emphasis on leverage and timing, allowing a smaller practitioner to overcome a larger opponent through precise movement and control.

## Visual Execution Sequence
Detailed description for clear visualization of the transition in action:

Starting in bottom Half Guard, you are on your back with your opponent on top, their right leg trapped between your legs, their chest pressing down with heavy pressure on your torso, and their arms controlling your upper body, attempting to flatten you out for a pass or submission setup. To initiate the Kiss of the Dragon sweep, you first secure an underhook with your left arm under their right armpit, gripping tightly to control their posture, while your right hand frames against their left hip to prevent them from driving forward. You then switch your hips explosively to the right, turning onto your right side, simultaneously swinging your left leg out from under their trapped leg and hooking it over their back near their waist, creating a controlling anchor point as their weight begins to shift due to your sudden movement. As you continue the hip switch, you pull with your underhook and push with your right frame, off-balancing them further to the right, while your right leg, now free, posts on the mat to drive upward, adding power to the sweep and lifting their base off the ground. Mid-sweep, you maintain tight control with your left leg hook and underhook, rolling them over their right shoulder as your body follows through the motion, using their momentum to complete the reversal, feeling their resistance weaken as they lose balance. You land on top, immediately establishing control by driving your chest into theirs, securing Side Control with your left arm under their head and your right arm blocking their far hip, or potentially transitioning to Mount if their legs are open, having successfully reversed the position with a dynamic hip switch and leg entanglement. Throughout the movement, you remain aware of their attempts to post or counter, adjusting your pressure to ensure they cannot recover guard, demonstrating an advanced offensive sweep that transforms a defensive Half Guard into a dominant top position in a fluid, high-energy sequence.

**Template**: "From bottom Half Guard, on back, opponent’s right leg trapped, heavy chest pressure on torso, arms controlling upper body. Secure left underhook under right armpit, grip tight for posture control, right hand frames left hip to block advance. Switch hips explosively right, turn onto right side, swing left leg out and hook over back near waist as anchor, shifting their weight. Pull with underhook, push with right frame, off-balance right, post right leg on mat, drive up to lift base. Maintain left leg hook and underhook mid-sweep, roll them over right shoulder, follow through with momentum, overpower resistance. Land on top, drive chest into theirs, secure Side Control or Mount, left arm under head, right blocking hip. Stay aware of counter attempts, adjust pressure to prevent guard recovery, transform defensive Half Guard into dominant top with dynamic hip switch and entanglement."

## Execution Steps
1. Begin in bottom Half Guard with the opponent’s leg trapped, recognizing the opportunity for a sweep when they apply heavy top pressure.
2. Secure an underhook with one arm under their armpit on the trapped leg side, gripping tightly to control their posture and limit their movement.
3. Frame with your other hand against their opposite hip or torso to prevent them from driving forward and flattening you out.
4. Execute an explosive hip switch towards the side of your underhook, turning onto that side to create an angle for the sweep.
5. Swing your outside leg out from under their trapped leg and hook it over their back near the waist, establishing a control point to anchor their body.
6. Pull with your underhook and push with your framing hand to off-balance the opponent in the direction of your hip switch, disrupting their base.
7. Post your inside leg on the mat and drive upward with power, using it to lift their base while rolling them over their shoulder with your combined control.
8. Follow through with the motion, landing on top in Side Control or Mount, immediately establishing control by driving your weight down and securing their upper body and hips.

## Key Details
- **Underhook Control**: Essential for posture disruption and sweep leverage.
- **Hip Switch Dynamics**: Explosive turn to create sweeping angle and momentum.
- **Leg Hook Anchor**: Outside leg over back secures opponent for reversal.
- **Framing Resistance**: Opposite hand frame prevents opponent’s forward pressure.
- **Posting Power**: Inside leg posts for driving force during sweep.
- **Off-Balance Direction**: Direct opponent’s weight to side of hip switch for fall.
- **Follow-Through Control**: Maintain grip and hook through roll to land on top.
- **Positional Consolidation**: Immediately secure top position to prevent scramble.

## Success Modifiers
Factors that influence the success rate of the transition:
- **Underhook Strength**: Secure grip and control of opponent’s posture (+15%)
- **Hip Switch Speed**: Explosive and fluid hip movement for angle creation (+12%)
- **Timing Accuracy**: Executing during opponent’s forward pressure or weight shift (+10%)
- **Leg Hook Placement**: Effective anchoring over opponent’s back (+8%)
- **Experience Level**: Familiarity with Half Guard sweeps and reversals (+5% per skill level)

## Common Counters and Counter-Attacks
Analysis of opponent responses with success rates for counter-attacks:
- **Posture Recovery** → [[Top Half Guard]] (Success Rate: 50%, Conditions: opponent postures up to resist underhook control)
- **Base Adjustment** → [[Side Control]] (Success Rate: 45%, Conditions: opponent widens base to prevent being rolled)
- **Grip Break** → [[Guard Pass]] (Success Rate: 40%, Conditions: opponent breaks underhook to initiate pass)
- **Counter Sweep** → [[Back Control]] (Success Rate: 35%, Conditions: opponent uses sweep momentum to take back)
- **Submission Threat** → [[Kimura Control]] (Success Rate: 30%, Conditions: opponent targets underhooking arm during sweep)

## Decision Logic for Transition
```
If [opponent pressure] is heavy in Half Guard with forward weight:
- Initiate [[Kiss of the Dragon]] sweep (Probability: 75%)

Else if [opponent posture] is broken with underhook secured:
- Execute [[Kiss of the Dragon]] to Top Position (Probability: 70%)

Else if [opponent base] is narrow and vulnerable to off-balance:
- Attempt [[Kiss of the Dragon]] to Side Control (Probability: 65%)

Else if [opponent counters] with posture or grip break mid-sweep:
- Adjust to [[Half Guard Recovery]] for defense (Probability: 55%)

Else if [sweep fails] due to insufficient hip switch or control:
- Reinforce [[Defensive Posture]] to prevent pass (Probability: 50%)
```

## Variants
- **Standard Kiss of the Dragon**: Classic Half Guard sweep with underhook and leg hook.
- **Deep Underhook Variation**: Deeper grip for increased control over opponent’s torso.
- **No-Hook Variation**: Sweep without leg hook, relying solely on hip switch and underhook.
- **Kiss to Mount Direct**: Aiming directly for Mount by clearing legs post-sweep.
- **Kiss to Back Take**: Adjusting mid-sweep to take opponent’s back if they turn away.
- **Lockdown Integration**: Combining with Lockdown control for initial setup.
- **Twister Hook Setup**: Using leg hook to set up Twister or other submissions.
- **Partial Sweep Scramble**: Accepting scramble if full reversal isn’t achieved.

## Tactical Applications
- **Reverse Heavy Pressure**: Primary use to counter top pressure in Half Guard.
