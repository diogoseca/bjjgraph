## State Machine Content Elements

### Visual Execution Sequence
Detailed step-by-step description for clear movement sequence visualization:

When caught in a Kimura grip, you first secure your trapped hand to your gi, belt, or body to lock the arm and prevent dangerous rotation. Instead of the traditional turn-in defense, you generate explosive forward momentum by driving with your legs and hips, initiating a forward roll over your trapped shoulder. As you roll, you maintain the arm lock against your body and tuck your head to execute a smooth forward roll similar to a judo ukemi or Granby roll. The rolling motion carries you through a complete 360-degree rotation, which reverses the rotational pressure on your shoulder. As the roll completes and you come back to your base, the momentum and position change allow you to extract your arm from the figure-four grip. You immediately establish guard or defensive frames to prevent the opponent from re-attacking.

**Template**: "From Kimura danger, lock your arm to your body, generate forward rolling momentum, execute smooth forward roll through 360 degrees, extract arm as roll completes, and recover guard position."

### Execution Steps (Numbered Sequence)
1. **Lock Defensive Grip**: Secure your trapped hand to your gi, belt, or body to prevent shoulder rotation
2. **Generate Rolling Momentum**: Drive with your legs and hips to initiate a forward roll over your trapped shoulder
3. **Tuck and Roll**: Tuck your head and execute a smooth forward roll while maintaining arm lock
4. **Complete Rotation**: Continue rolling motion through 360 degrees to reverse the lock position
5. **Extract Arm**: As roll completes, extract your arm from the figure-four grip
6. **Establish Guard**: Immediately recover guard position or establish defensive frames

### Key Technical Details
Critical elements that determine success:
- **Grip Requirements**: Trapped arm must be locked to body throughout entire roll
- **Base/Foundation**: Explosive leg and hip drive generates rolling momentum
- **Timing Windows**: Must initiate roll before opponent secures finishing pressure (first 3-4 seconds)
- **Leverage Points**: Forward roll reverses rotational direction and relieves shoulder stress
- **Common Adjustments**: Vary roll speed and direction based on opponent's grip angle

### Success Modifiers
Factors that increase/decrease probability:
- **Rolling Proficiency**: Experience with forward rolls and Granby mechanics (+/-15%)
- **Shoulder Flexibility**: Range of motion for safe rotation (+/-12%)
- **Timing Precision**: Initiating roll at optimal moment (+/-10%)
- **Arm Lock Quality**: Maintaining defensive grip throughout roll (+/-10%)
- **Space Availability**: Room to complete full rolling motion (+/-8%)

## Counter-Attack Analysis

### Common Counters
Opponent responses with success rates:
- **Release and Reset**: Letting go of Kimura to prevent being rolled → [[Scramble Position]] (Success Rate: 60%, Conditions: early release)
- **Follow the Roll**: Maintaining Kimura grip while following defender's motion → [[Kimura]] (Success Rate: 45%, Conditions: tight grip control)
- **Transition to Back**: Using momentum to take back control → [[Back Control]] (Success Rate: 40%, Conditions: timing dependent)
- **Increase Pressure**: Driving finishing pressure before roll completes → [[Kimura]] (Success Rate: 50%, Conditions: quick recognition)

Format: `[[Counter Technique]] → [[Result State]] (Success Rate: X%, Conditions: [when applicable])`

### Decision Logic
```
If [roll initiation] is early:
- Execute [[Release and Reset]] (Probability: 60%)

Else if [grip control] is maintained:
- Execute [[Follow the Roll]] (Probability: 45%)

Else if [momentum] can be redirected:
- Execute [[Transition to Back]] (Probability: 40%)

Else [optimal escape execution]:
- Accept transition (Probability: Success Rate - Modifiers)
```

## Educational Content

### Expert Insights
Commentary as if from recognized authorities:
- **John Danaher**: "The rolling Kimura escape is mechanically sophisticated, using rotational momentum to counter the submission's rotational pressure. The critical element is maintaining the defensive arm lock throughout the entire roll - if the arm separates from your body during the roll, you risk serious shoulder injury. The forward roll creates a situation where you're rotating in the same direction as the Kimura pressure but faster and more completely, which effectively reverses the lock. This is an advanced technique requiring significant rolling proficiency and shoulder flexibility."
- **Gordon Ryan**: "In competition, I use the rolling escape when the traditional turn-in defense isn't available or when I want to create scramble opportunities. The key is committing fully to the roll - hesitating halfway through is when injuries happen. I only use this escape when I'm confident in my rolling mechanics and when the Kimura isn't too deep. If they have a tight Kimura with good positioning, the standard turn-in defense is safer. The rolling escape works best against opponents who aren't expecting the dynamic movement and release their grip in surprise."
- **Eddie Bravo**: "The rolling Kimura escape comes from wrestling and judo influence on BJJ. We drill it extensively in 10th Planet because it creates scramble situations that we excel in. The Granby roll mechanics are the foundation - if you can't Granby roll smoothly, don't attempt this escape under pressure. When it works, it's beautiful - you escape the Kimura and often end up in a better position than before. The athletic requirement is higher than static defenses, but for younger, flexible practitioners, it's often more natural than the traditional defense."

Each insight should focus on one key technical or strategic element.

### Common Errors
For knowledge test generation:
- **Error**: Attempting roll without locking arm to body first
- **Why It Fails**: Arm rotates freely during roll causing severe shoulder injury risk
- **Correction**: Always secure defensive grip before initiating any rolling motion
- **Recognition**: Feeling arm separating from body or sharp shoulder pain during roll

- **Error**: Rolling too slowly or hesitantly
- **Why It Fails**: Insufficient momentum leaves you vulnerable mid-roll with poor position
- **Correction**: Commit fully to explosive rolling motion once initiated
- **Recognition**: Getting stuck halfway through roll or opponent maintaining control easily

- **Error**: Poor head tuck during forward roll
- **Why It Fails**: Risk of neck injury and failed roll execution
- **Correction**: Proper forward roll technique with chin tucked and smooth rotation
- **Recognition**: Pressure on head or neck during roll, awkward landing

- **Error**: Attempting escape when Kimura is too deep or too tight
- **Why It Fails**: Rolling with maximum pressure already applied risks shoulder damage
- **Correction**: Use traditional turn-in defense for deep Kimuras; rolling escape for early attacks
- **Recognition**: Already experiencing significant shoulder pain before roll initiation

- **Error**: Failing to recover guard after successful escape
- **Why It Fails**: Opponent immediately re-attacks or advances position despite arm escape
- **Correction**: Coordinate arm extraction with immediate guard establishment
- **Recognition**: Escaping Kimura but ending in poor position vulnerable to attacks

### Timing Considerations
When to attempt this transition:
- **Optimal Conditions**: Early Kimura attack with space available for rolling motion
- **Avoid When**: Kimura is deep with finishing pressure already applied
- **Setup Sequences**: Best against opponents unfamiliar with dynamic escape methods
- **Follow-up Windows**: Must establish guard within 1-2 seconds after completing roll

### Prerequisites
Requirements before attempting:
- **Technical Skills**: Proficient forward rolling and Granby roll mechanics
- **Physical Preparation**: High shoulder flexibility and core strength for rolling
- **Positional Understanding**: Recognition of Kimura danger and escape timing
