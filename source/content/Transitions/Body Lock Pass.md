## Transition Description
The Body Lock Pass is a modern pressure-based guard passing technique where the passer secures a body lock (arms wrapped around the opponent's torso) from a high posture to control the opponent's upper body while systematically addressing the legs to complete the pass. Unlike more traditional passes that focus primarily on leg control, the Body Lock Pass emphasizes upper body control as the foundation for neutralizing the opponent's lower body defensive capabilities. This approach has gained significant prominence in modern competition due to its effectiveness against seated open guard variations, particularly butterfly guard. The technique represents an evolution in passing strategy that prioritizes systematic pressure and control over speed or agility.

## Execution Steps
1. Establish upper body control through the body lock grip (arms wrapped around torso)
2. Create and maintain high posture to prevent opponent's offensive hooks
3. Apply forward pressure to limit opponent's mobility and defensive options
4. Control opponent's knees/legs to prevent guard retention
5. Step one leg back to create angle while maintaining body lock control
6. Drive weight forward and down to collapse opponent's posture
7. Progress systematically around legs while maintaining pressure
8. Transition to side control or mount upon clearing the legs

## Key Grips/Controls
- Body lock grip (hands clasped around opponent's torso)
- High posture with chest pressure
- Knee control/pinning during transition
- Hip connection to prevent space creation
- Head positioning to limit opponent's mobility
- Shoulder pressure during completion phase
- Leg positioning to block defensive recovery

## Common Counters
- [[Butterfly Elevation]] → [[Butterfly Sweep]]
- [[Arm Frame]] → [[Space Creation]]
- [[Head Position Control]] → [[Guard Retention]]
- [[Shin Shield]] → [[Defensive Frame]]
- [[Single Leg X Entry]] → [[Single Leg X Guard]]

## Variants
- Standing Body Lock Pass (initiated from standing)
- Modified Body Lock with Leg Weave (hybrid technique)
- Body Lock to Folding Pass (combination method)
- Half Guard Body Lock Pass (specialized application)
- Double Underhook Pass (related control mechanism)
- Butterfly-specific Body Lock Pass (targeted approach)
- Body Lock to Mount (direct mounting variation)
- Head Outside Body Lock (alternate head positioning)

## Expert Insights
- **Danaher System**: Emphasizes the Body Lock Pass as a powerful systematic approach to dealing with seated guard positions, particularly focusing on the mechanical efficiency of controlling the opponent's upper body to limit hip mobility. Creates clear conceptual framework for how upper body control can nullify lower body defensive capabilities, establishing precise technical details for optimal pressure application and angle creation.
- **Gordon Ryan**: Has made the Body Lock Pass a cornerstone of his guard passing system, particularly against seated open guard players. Emphasizes the importance of posture, pressure sequencing, and systematic progression through defensive layers. Places special focus on timing the transition from control to pass completion based on recognizing specific defensive reactions from the opponent.
- **Eddie Bravo**: Has incorporated Body Lock Pass concepts into his 10th Planet system, adapting the technique to address the specific challenges presented by rubber guard and other 10th Planet positions. Emphasizes maintaining connection and pressure throughout the passing sequence while being vigilant against leg entanglement entries.

## Timing Considerations
- Execute when opponent is in seated open guard
- Time the initiation with opponent's forward momentum
- Perform after breaking opponent's grips or controls
- Implement when opponent's posture is compromised
- Use when opponent commits to butterfly or seated guard

## Follow-up Options
- [[Side Control Consolidation]] → [[Side Control]]
- [[Transition to Mount]] → [[Mount]]
- [[Knee on Belly]] → [[Knee on Belly Position]]
- [[North-South Transition]] → [[North-South]]
- [[Kimura Trap]] → [[Kimura Control]]
- [[Back Step]] → [[Back Control]]

## Common Errors
- Insufficient upper body control → Loss of fundamental control
- Low posture → Vulnerability to hooks/sweeps
- Poor pressure direction → Ineffective positional progression
- Neglecting leg control during transition → Re-guarding opportunity
- Premature pass attempt → Position compromise
- Telegraphing passing direction → Defensive adjustment

## Historical Context
The Body Lock Pass represents a relatively recent evolution in BJJ passing methodology, gaining prominence in the 2010s as a response to the increasing sophistication of seated open guard play, particularly butterfly guard variations. While elements of upper body control have always existed in traditional passing, the systematic development of the Body Lock Pass as a comprehensive approach is largely credited to the Danaher Death Squad's influence on modern grappling. The technique's effectiveness has been demonstrated at the highest levels of competition by practitioners like Gordon Ryan, Craig Jones, and Lachlan Giles, establishing it as a cornerstone of modern passing strategy.

## Computer Science Analogy
The Body Lock Pass implements a "hierarchical constraint system" in the BJJ state machine, where establishing a primary constraint (upper body control) creates cascading limitations on secondary systems (hip mobility, leg defenses). This creates a form of "dependency injection" where controlling one system forces predictable behaviors in dependent systems, allowing for systematic exploitation. The technique exemplifies the concept of "scope restriction programming" where the action space of the opponent is progressively reduced through systematic limitation of available defensive options, effectively reducing the computational complexity of the passing problem by eliminating potential defensive pathways.
