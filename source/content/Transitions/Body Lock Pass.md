## Transition Description
The Body Lock Pass is a modern pressure-based guard passing technique where the passer secures a body lock (arms wrapped around the opponent's torso) from a high posture to control the opponent's upper body while systematically addressing the legs to complete the pass. Unlike more traditional passes that focus primarily on leg control, the Body Lock Pass emphasizes upper body control as the foundation for neutralizing the opponent's lower body defensive capabilities. This approach has gained significant prominence in modern competition due to its effectiveness against seated open guard variations, particularly butterfly guard. The technique represents an evolution in passing strategy that prioritizes systematic pressure and control over speed or agility.

## Visual Execution Sequence
Detailed description for clear visualization of the transition in action:

From a standing position or top open guard, you face your opponent who is seated in an open guard, attempting to establish butterfly hooks or other controls. You step forward, maintaining a high posture to avoid their offensive hooks, and secure a body lock by wrapping your arms around their torso, clasping your hands tightly near their lower back to limit their hip mobility. As they try to elevate or frame, you apply forward pressure with your chest and shoulders, driving their upper body back while keeping your head positioned to prevent guillotine attempts. You then control their knees or legs with your own legs or hands to prevent guard retention, stepping one leg back to create an angle while maintaining the body lock. With persistent pressure, you drive your weight forward and down, collapsing their posture further, making it difficult for them to recover or attack. Finally, you progress systematically around their legs, using hip connection and shoulder pressure to clear their defenses, transitioning into side control or mount as their guard is fully bypassed.

**Template**: "From standing or top open guard, face seated opponent in open guard. Step forward with high posture, secure body lock around torso, clasp hands near lower back. Apply forward pressure with chest, control head to avoid guillotine. Control knees or legs, step one leg back for angle, maintain lock. Drive weight forward and down to collapse posture. Clear legs with hip connection and shoulder pressure, transition to side control or mount."

## Execution Steps
1. Establish upper body control through the body lock grip by wrapping arms around opponent's torso and clasping hands near their lower back.
2. Create and maintain high posture with your chest up to prevent opponent's offensive hooks or sweeps.
3. Apply forward pressure with chest and shoulders to limit opponent's mobility and defensive options.
4. Control opponent's knees or legs with your own legs or hands to prevent guard retention or elevation.
5. Step one leg back to create an angle for passing while maintaining body lock control to restrict hip movement.
6. Drive weight forward and down with persistent pressure to collapse opponent's posture and reduce their defensive space.
7. Progress systematically around legs, using hip connection and shoulder pressure to clear remaining defenses.
8. Transition to side control or mount upon clearing the legs, consolidating the new dominant position.

## Key Details
- **Body Lock Grip**: Hands clasped tightly around opponent's torso for upper body control
- **High Posture**: Chest up and head positioned to avoid offensive hooks or submissions
- **Chest Pressure**: Forward pressure with chest to limit opponent's mobility
- **Knee Control**: Pin or control opponent's knees/legs during transition to prevent recovery
- **Hip Connection**: Maintain close hip proximity to prevent space creation for defenses
- **Head Positioning**: Keep head safe to limit opponent's mobility and submission threats
- **Shoulder Pressure**: Use shoulder to drive down during completion phase for posture collapse
- **Leg Positioning**: Step back and angle legs to block defensive recovery or sweeps

## Success Modifiers
Factors that influence the success rate of the transition:
- **Upper Body Control**: Strong body lock grip to restrict hip mobility (+15%)
- **Posture Maintenance**: High posture to avoid hooks and sweeps (+10%)
- **Pressure Application**: Consistent forward and downward pressure (+10%)

## Common Counters and Counter-Attacks
Analysis of opponent responses with success rates for counter-attacks:
- [[Butterfly Elevation]] → [[Butterfly Sweep]] (Success Rate: 50%, Conditions: opponent elevates with hooks before body lock is secure)
- [[Arm Frame]] → [[Space Creation]] (Success Rate: 45%, Conditions: opponent frames with arms to push away)
- [[Head Position Control]] → [[Guard Retention]] (Success Rate: 55%, Conditions: opponent controls head for posture or submission)
- [[Shin Shield]] → [[Defensive Frame]] (Success Rate: 40%, Conditions: opponent inserts shin shield to block pressure)
- [[Single Leg X Entry]] → [[Single Leg X Guard]] (Success Rate: 60%, Conditions: opponent transitions to leg entanglement)

## Decision Logic for Opponent Behavior
```
If [opponent posture] is collapsed with limited mobility:
- Execute [[Body Lock Pass Completion]] (Probability: 80%)

Else if [opponent frames] with arms to create space:
- Attempt [[Folding Pass Variation]] (Probability: 50%)

Else if [opponent head control] threatens submission or retention:
- Transition to [[Head Outside Body Lock]] (Probability: 60%)

Else if [opponent legs] transition to entanglement like Single Leg X:
- Adjust to [[Leg Weave Counter]] (Probability: 55%)

Else [maintain control]:
- Reinforce body lock pressure and posture (Probability: 50%)
```

## Variants
- Standing Body Lock Pass (initiated from standing for maximum pressure)
- Modified Body Lock with Leg Weave (hybrid technique for leg control)
- Body Lock to Folding Pass (combination method for posture collapse)
- Half Guard Body Lock Pass (specialized application from half guard top)
- Double Underhook Pass (related control mechanism with underhooks)
- Butterfly-Specific Body Lock Pass (targeted approach against butterfly guard)
- Body Lock to Mount (direct mounting variation for immediate dominance)
- Head Outside Body Lock (alternate head positioning to avoid submissions)

## Expert Insights
- **John Danaher**: "The Body Lock Pass is a powerful systematic approach to dealing with seated guard positions, focusing on the mechanical efficiency of controlling the opponent's upper body to limit hip mobility. It creates a clear conceptual framework for how upper body control can nullify lower body defensive capabilities, establishing precise technical details for optimal pressure application and angle creation. This pass is a cornerstone of modern passing strategy."
- **Gordon Ryan**: "I've made the Body Lock Pass a cornerstone of my guard passing system, particularly against seated open guard players. The importance lies in posture, pressure sequencing, and systematic progression through defensive layers. Timing the transition from control to pass completion based on recognizing specific defensive reactions is key to high success rates."
- **Eddie Bravo**: "In the 10th Planet system, we've incorporated Body Lock Pass concepts to address challenges presented by rubber guard and other positions. I emphasize maintaining connection and pressure throughout the passing sequence while being vigilant against leg entanglement entries. This pass adapts well to unorthodox guards by focusing on upper body dominance."

## Common Errors

## Historical Context
The Body Lock Pass represents a relatively recent evolution in BJJ passing methodology, gaining prominence in the 2010s as a response to the increasing sophistication of seated open guard play, particularly butterfly guard variations. While elements of upper body control have always existed in traditional passing, the systematic development of the Body Lock Pass as a comprehensive approach is largely credited to the Danaher Death Squad's influence on modern grappling. The technique's effectiveness has been demonstrated at the highest levels of competition by practitioners like Gordon Ryan, Craig Jones, and Lachlan Giles, establishing it as a cornerstone of modern passing strategy.

## Conceptual Framework
The Body Lock Pass exemplifies core BJJ principles of control, pressure, and positional dominance. By prioritizing upper body control, it transforms the guard passing problem into a systematic process of limiting opponent mobility before addressing lower body defenses. This represents strategic jiu-jitsu at its finest: using hierarchical control to dismantle complex guard systems with persistent pressure. The pass demonstrates how focused constraint of key movement areas can shift the positional hierarchy with calculated progression.

## Computer Science Analogy
The Body Lock Pass implements a "hierarchical constraint system" in the BJJ state machine, where establishing a primary constraint (upper body control) creates cascading limitations on secondary systems (hip mobility, leg defenses). This creates a form of "dependency injection" where controlling one system forces predictable behaviors in dependent systems, allowing for systematic exploitation. The technique exemplifies the concept of "scope restriction programming" where the action space of the opponent is progressively reduced through systematic limitation of available defensive options, effectively reducing the computational complexity of the passing problem by eliminating potential defensive pathways.
