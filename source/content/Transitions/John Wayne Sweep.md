## State Machine Content Elements

### Visual Execution Sequence
Detailed step-by-step description for clear movement sequence visualization:

From a Half Guard Bottom or Knee Shield Half Guard position, you start on your side, facing the opponent who is on top, with your bottom leg trapping one of their legs between yours, while your top leg is either framing as a knee shield across their chest or positioned to block their hip, and you secure a strong underhook with your top arm under their near arm, reaching up toward their shoulder or back to control their upper body. You maintain a tight connection with your underhook, keeping your elbow close to your body to prevent them from pulling out, while your bottom arm frames against their far hip or grips their pants to block their posture and create space, ensuring your head is positioned defensively to avoid crossfaces or chokes. As you prepare to initiate the sweep, you shift your hips underneath the opponent by scooting them out to the side, using your underhook to pull their weight forward and slightly off-balance them, while simultaneously swinging your top leg (knee shield leg) down and out to the side to create an angle, planting your foot on the mat for leverage. With your hips now under their center of gravity, you drive upward with your underhook and bottom leg, using your posted top foot to assist in rolling them over your body to the side of your underhook, maintaining control of their trapped leg to prevent them from basing out, as you follow through by coming up on top during the roll, keeping pressure with your chest to pin them. You land in a dominant top position, such as side control or a transitional top position, immediately securing their upper body with an underhook or crossface to prevent escapes, establishing control to consolidate your position after the sweep.

**Template**: "From Half Guard Bottom or Knee Shield Half Guard, lie on side, trap opponent's leg, secure underhook under near arm. Frame with bottom arm against far hip, keep head defensive. Shift hips underneath by scooting out, pull opponent forward with underhook, swing top leg out for angle. Drive up with underhook and bottom leg, roll opponent over using posted foot, follow to top. Land in top position or side control, secure control with underhook or crossface."

### Execution Steps (Numbered Sequence)
1. **Setup Requirements**: Start in Half Guard Bottom or Knee Shield Half Guard on side
2. **Leg Control**: Trap opponent's leg between yours, bottom leg hooks their ankle
3. **Underhook Grip**: Secure strong underhook under opponent's near arm to shoulder
4. **Framing Defense**: Use bottom arm to frame far hip or grip pants, block posture
5. **Head Positioning**: Keep head defensive to avoid crossface or choke attacks
6. **Hip Shift**: Scoot hips out to side, get underneath opponent's center of gravity
7. **Off-Balance Pull**: Use underhook to pull opponent forward, disrupt their base
8. **Leg Swing**: Swing top leg out and down, plant foot for leverage and angle
9. **Sweep Drive**: Drive up with underhook and bottom leg, roll opponent over to side
10. **Position Secure**: Follow roll to top position or side control, maintain control

### Key Technical Details
Critical elements that determine success:
- **Underhook Control**: Strong grip under opponent's arm to pull and off-balance
- **Hip Positioning**: Getting hips underneath opponent's center for leverage
- **Leg Framing**: Top leg swing and bottom leg hook to create sweep angle
- **Opponent Posture**: Breaking opponent's posture forward to disrupt base
- **Timing**: Coordinating hip shift and underhook pull during weight shift

### Success Modifiers
Factors that increase/decrease probability:
- **Underhook Strength**: Depth and control of underhook grip (+/-20%)
- **Hip Mobility**: Ability to shift hips underneath opponent (+/-15%)
- **Opponent Weight Distribution**: Catching opponent leaning forward (+/-15%)
- **Leg Control**: Effectiveness of trapping opponent's leg (+/-10%)
- **Knowledge Test Performance**: Understanding half guard sweep mechanics (+/-10%)

## Counter-Attack Analysis

### Common Counters
Opponent responses with success rates:
- **Posture Recovery**: Regaining upright posture to resist pull → [[Top Half Guard]] (Success Rate: 40%, Conditions: early recognition)
- **Base Widening**: Posting far leg or arm to prevent roll → [[Top Position]] (Success Rate: 35%, Conditions: quick reaction)
- **Counter Pressure**: Driving weight back to flatten sweeper → [[Flattened Half Guard]] (Success Rate: 25%, Conditions: strong top control)
- **Submission Counter**: Attacking with choke or arm lock → [[Ezekiel Choke]] (Success Rate: 20%, Conditions: advanced skill)

Format: `[[Counter Technique]] → [[Result State]] (Success Rate: X%, Conditions: [when applicable])`

### Decision Logic
```
If [sweep setup] is recognized early:
- Execute [[Posture Recovery]] (Probability: 40%)

Else if [base] can be widened quickly:
- Execute [[Base Widening]] (Probability: 35%)

Else if [weight] can be driven back:
- Attempt [[Counter Pressure]] (Probability: 25%)

Else [advanced skill] allows submission:
- Attempt [[Submission Counter]] (Probability: 20%)

Else [optimal execution]:
- Accept transition (Probability: Success Rate - Modifiers)
```

## Educational Content

### Expert Insights
Commentary as if from recognized authorities:
- **John Danaher**: "The John Wayne Sweep is a fundamental half guard technique that exemplifies the importance of underhook control in bottom positions. The key lies in shifting your hips underneath the opponent to create leverage for the roll, demonstrating how positional advantage can overcome strength disparities. This sweep teaches essential principles of leverage and timing that are critical for all guard systems."
- **Gordon Ryan**: "In competition, the John Wayne Sweep is a high-percentage move from half guard when you can secure a deep underhook and catch the opponent leaning forward. I use it to reverse position and gain top control, often chaining it with immediate passing or submission attempts. The technique shows how half guard can be an offensive platform rather than just defensive."
- **Eddie Bravo**: "The John Wayne Sweep integrates well with modern half guard systems, offering a dynamic way to reverse position using underhook control. It’s a great move for grapplers who want to attack from the bottom, blending traditional BJJ with wrestling-style reversals. This sweep is perfect for building an active, offensive half guard game."

Each insight should focus on one key technical or strategic element.

### Common Errors
For knowledge test generation:
- **Error**: Weak or shallow underhook grip
- **Why It Fails**: Lacks control to pull opponent forward and off-balance
- **Correction**: Secure deep underhook reaching up to shoulder or back
- **Recognition**: Opponent easily pulls arm out or maintains posture

- **Error**: Insufficient hip shift underneath opponent
- **Why It Fails**: Reduces leverage for sweep, making roll difficult
- **Correction**: Scoot hips out to side, position under opponent's center of gravity
- **Recognition**: Sweep stalls or opponent remains stable on top

- **Error**: Poor timing of pull and leg swing
- **Why It Fails**: Lacks coordinated force to execute sweep effectively
- **Correction**: Pull with underhook as top leg swings out for angle and leverage
- **Recognition**: Opponent counters with posture recovery or base widening

### Timing Considerations
When to attempt this transition:
- **Optimal Conditions**: When opponent leans forward or shifts weight over trapped leg
- **Avoid When**: Opponent maintains heavy, centered pressure with strong posture
- **Setup Sequences**: After securing deep underhook and framing against far hip
- **Follow-up Windows**: Must complete sweep within 3-5 seconds to avoid counters

### Prerequisites
Requirements before attempting:
- **Technical Skills**: Understanding of half guard principles and underhook control
- **Physical Preparation**: Hip mobility and core strength for sweep leverage
- **Positional Understanding**: Control points in half guard bottom positions
