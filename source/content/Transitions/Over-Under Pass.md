- **Speed Requirements**: Low - emphasizes pressure over speed

## State Machine Content Elements

### Visual Execution Sequence
Detailed step-by-step description for clear movement sequence visualization:

From guard top position, you establish an over-under configuration by threading one arm over the opponent's leg while diving the other arm under their opposite leg, creating a strong control structure. Your opponent typically attempts to create frames or recover their guard structure. You step your leg back on the over-hook side to create an angle, then drive your chest pressure down toward the mat while beginning to circle toward your under-hook side. The stacking pressure forces their hips up and legs together as you methodically pass their legs to the side, maintaining constant chest-to-chest pressure. You complete the pass by establishing side control with shoulder pressure pinning their torso and your head positioned for cross-face control.

**Template**: "From guard top with over-under control, step back to create angle, drive chest pressure down while circling to under-hook side. Stack hips, pass legs to side, establish side control."

### Execution Steps (Numbered Sequence)
1. **Setup Requirements**: Establish over-under configuration with one arm over leg, one under leg
2. **Initial Movement**: Step leg nearest to over-hook side back to create passing angle
3. **Opponent Response**: Opponent attempts to recover guard, create frames, or prevent stacking
4. **Adaptation**: Drive chest pressure down while circling toward under-hook side
5. **Completion**: Stack opponent's hips while methodically passing legs to the side
6. **Consolidation**: Establish side control with shoulder pressure and cross-face control

### Key Technical Details
Critical elements that determine success:
- **Grip Requirements**: Tight over-under control with locked hands or strong grips
- **Base/Foundation**: Wide base with stepping angle to generate passing momentum
- **Timing Windows**: Execute when opponent's guard is opening or frames are weak
- **Leverage Points**: Chest pressure and hip stacking create passing angle
- **Common Adjustments**: Switch circling direction if opponent counters initial angle

### Success Modifiers
Factors that increase/decrease probability:
- **Setup Quality**: Depth of under-hook and tightness of over-hook (+/-15%)
- **Timing Precision**: Executing during opponent's guard opening (+/-10%)
- **Opponent Fatigue**: Reduced ability to maintain guard structure (+/-10%)
- **Knowledge Test Performance**: Understanding pressure angles and stacking (+/-10%)
- **Position Control**: Quality of chest pressure and hip control (+/-10%)

## Counter-Attack Analysis

### Common Counters
Opponent responses with success rates:
- **Frame and Shrimp**: Creating frames on hips to prevent pressure → [[Open Guard Bottom]] (Success Rate: 50%, Conditions: early frames before stack)
- **Triangle Attempt**: Attacking exposed neck during pass → [[Triangle Setup]] (Success Rate: 30%, Conditions: if head positioning is poor)
- **Foot on Hip**: Placing foot on hip to create distance → [[Open Guard Bottom]] (Success Rate: 35%, Conditions: if under-hook is shallow)
- **Sit-up Sweep**: Using stacking angle to off-balance → [[Sweep to Top]] (Success Rate: 25%, Conditions: if base is narrow)

Format: `[[Counter Technique]] → [[Result State]] (Success Rate: X%, Conditions: [when applicable])`

### Decision Logic
```
If [chest pressure] is insufficient:
- Execute [[Frame and Shrimp]] (Probability: 50%)

Else if [head positioning] is exposed:
- Execute [[Triangle Attempt]] (Probability: 30%)

Else if [under-hook] is shallow:
- Execute [[Foot on Hip]] (Probability: 35%)

Else [optimal pass execution]:
- Accept transition (Probability: Success Rate - Modifiers)
```

## Educational Content

### Expert Insights
Commentary as if from recognized authorities:
- **John Danaher**: "The over-under pass succeeds through systematic pressure application and angle creation. The key is understanding that the pass occurs not through speed, but through the methodical elimination of space. Your chest pressure must be relentless, and your circling motion must be timed to coincide with their attempts to recover guard. The stacking element forces them into a defensive posture where hip movement becomes impossible."
- **Gordon Ryan**: "In competition, I use the over-under pass as a fundamental pressure passing technique that works at the highest levels. It's particularly effective against opponents who rely on guard retention. The transition to side control is immediate once the legs are cleared, which allows for quick point scoring and submission opportunities. I focus on making my chest pressure unbearable."
- **Eddie Bravo**: "The over-under pass can be modified with various leg control methods and circling patterns. While it's traditionally a pressure pass, you can integrate it with other passing systems by using it to create reactions. When opponents defend the over-under, it opens up opportunities for knee slice or leg drag passes. The versatility makes it effective across different guard types."

Each insight should focus on one key technical or strategic element.

### Common Errors
For knowledge test generation:
- **Error**: Insufficient chest pressure during stacking phase
- **Why It Fails**: Allows opponent to maintain guard structure and create frames
- **Correction**: Drive chest down aggressively while maintaining over-under grips
- **Recognition**: Opponent easily recovers guard or creates space

- **Error**: Poor angle creation with stepping pattern
- **Why It Fails**: Reduces passing efficiency and allows opponent to track passer
- **Correction**: Step back leg at 45-degree angle toward over-hook side
- **Recognition**: Passing feels stuck or opponent easily squares up

- **Error**: Releasing under-hook too early during pass
- **Why It Fails**: Opponent can insert knee shield or recover guard
- **Correction**: Maintain under-hook until legs are completely cleared
- **Recognition**: Opponent recovers half guard or full guard mid-pass

- **Error**: Head positioning too high during pass
- **Why It Fails**: Exposes neck to triangle attacks or allows opponent to create frames
- **Correction**: Keep head tight to opponent's body with chin tucked
- **Recognition**: Opponent threatens triangle or easily pushes head away

- **Error**: Narrow base during stacking pressure
- **Why It Fails**: Reduces stability and allows opponent to off-balance passer
- **Correction**: Maintain wide base with back leg stepped out for support
- **Recognition**: Feeling off-balance or opponent attempts sweep

### Timing Considerations
When to attempt this transition:
- **Optimal Conditions**: When opponent's guard is opening or they're attempting to set up attacks
- **Avoid When**: Opponent has strong closed guard or effective guard retention
- **Setup Sequences**: After breaking closed guard or during open guard transitions
- **Follow-up Windows**: Must complete pass within 10-15 seconds before fatigue sets in

### Prerequisites
Requirements before attempting:
- **Technical Skills**: Understanding of pressure passing and guard breaking
- **Physical Preparation**: Upper body strength for sustained pressure and stacking
- **Positional Understanding**: Guard top mechanics and passing angles
- **Experience Level**: Intermediate technique requiring good base and pressure

## Technical Assessment Elements
