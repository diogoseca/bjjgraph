# Technical Standup
#bjj #transition #escape #standing #fundamental

## Visual Execution Sequence

From guard bottom or seated position, you begin by posting your hand on the mat behind you for support while keeping your other hand framing toward your opponent. Your posted hand should be positioned at a 45-degree angle from your body for optimal base. You bring your far leg (opposite side from posted hand) underneath you, creating a tripod base with your posted hand, near knee, and far foot. Your near leg extends out as a barrier between you and your opponent, protecting you from immediate attacks. You push off your posted hand and far foot simultaneously, lifting your hips and elevating to standing position while maintaining your frame and distance from the opponent. Throughout the movement, you keep your eyes on your opponent and maintain defensive positioning. As you complete the standup, you establish your wrestling stance or fighting posture, ready to engage or disengage as needed.

**One-Sentence Summary**: "From seated position, you post hand behind you, create tripod base with near knee and far foot, then push to standing while maintaining defensive frame with extended near leg."

## Execution Steps

1. **Setup Requirements**: From seated or guard bottom position, establish posting hand behind body at 45-degree angle
2. **Initial Movement**: Bring far leg underneath body while extending near leg as barrier toward opponent
3. **Base Creation**: Form tripod base with posted hand, near knee, and far foot planted firmly
4. **Hip Elevation**: Push explosively off posted hand and far foot, lifting hips off mat
5. **Standup Completion**: Bring far leg forward while rising to [[Standing Position]], maintaining frame throughout
6. **Consolidation**: Establish standing posture with hands ready, distance controlled from opponent

## Key Technical Details

- **Grip Requirements**: Posted hand provides structural support, free hand frames toward opponent for distance control
- **Base/Foundation**: Tripod base (hand, knee, foot) creates stable platform for explosive standup
- **Timing Windows**: Execute when opponent is at distance or during engagement transitions
- **Leverage Points**: Simultaneous push from hand and foot creates elevation force
- **Common Adjustments**: Adjust posting angle based on opponent's pressure direction

## Common Counters

Opponent defensive responses with success rates and conditions:

- **[[Double Leg Takedown]]** → [[Guard Top]] (Success Rate: 55%, Conditions: opponent shoots during standup transition)
- **[[Single Leg Attack]]** → [[Guard Top]] (Success Rate: 50%, Conditions: opponent attacks extended leg during movement)
- **[[Snap Down]]** → [[Turtle Position]] (Success Rate: 45%, Conditions: opponent controls head and drives down during standup)
- **[[Front Headlock]]** → [[Front Headlock]] (Success Rate: 40%, Conditions: opponent secures head control during elevation)

### Decision Logic for AI Opponent

```
If [base_formation] < 60%:
- Execute [[Double Leg Takedown]] (Probability: 55%)

Else if [extended_leg exposed]:
- Execute [[Single Leg Attack]] (Probability: 50%)

Else if [posture is compromised]:
- Execute [[Snap Down]] (Probability: 45%)

Else [optimal execution conditions]:
- Accept transition (Probability: Base Success Rate + Applied Modifiers)
```

## Expert Insights

### John Danaher
"The technical standup is fundamentally about creating a strong base from which to elevate safely. The tripod structure - hand, knee, foot - provides maximum stability while minimizing exposure time during the transition. The extended leg serves as both a measuring stick for distance and a defensive barrier against attacks. The key is maintaining visual contact with the opponent throughout while executing the movement as one smooth, controlled action."

### Gordon Ryan
"In competition, the technical standup is my primary method for disengaging when I don't want to play guard. The timing is critical - you need to create enough distance first so they can't immediately attack during your standup. I use hand fighting and foot positioning to control the space before committing to the standup. The movement needs to be explosive enough to complete before they can close distance, but controlled enough to maintain defensive positioning."

### Eddie Bravo
"The technical standup is essential even in guard-focused systems like 10th Planet because you need to control when and how engagements happen. I teach it as a reset mechanism - when the position isn't what you want, stand up safely and reestablish on your terms. The key is that extended leg creating a barrier - they have to deal with that leg before they can pressure you. Use it to create distance, then either re-engage or maintain standing position based on strategy."

## Common Errors

### Error 1: Posting hand too close to body or at wrong angle
- **Why It Fails**: Poor hand position reduces base stability and makes elevation mechanically inefficient
- **Correction**: Post hand 12-18 inches behind hip at 45-degree angle from body line
- **Recognition**: Feeling unstable during standup, difficulty generating elevation power

### Error 2: Not creating proper tripod base before attempting to stand
- **Why It Fails**: Weak base makes standup slow and vulnerable to opponent's attacks
- **Correction**: Ensure hand, knee, and foot are all firmly planted before pushing to stand
- **Recognition**: Losing balance during transition, opponent easily disrupting standup attempt

### Error 3: Turning away from opponent during standup
- **Why It Fails**: Losing visual contact allows opponent to attack unexpectedly
- **Correction**: Keep eyes on opponent throughout entire movement, maintain facing angle
- **Recognition**: Getting surprised by opponent's attacks, not seeing threats developing

### Error 4: Bringing extended leg in too early before standing
- **Why It Fails**: Removes defensive barrier allowing opponent to close distance and attack
- **Correction**: Maintain extended leg as barrier until fully standing and balanced
- **Recognition**: Opponent rushing in during standup, attacks landing before you're established

### Error 5: Slow or hesitant execution lacking explosiveness
- **Why It Fails**: Gradual standup gives opponent time to close distance and attack
- **Correction**: Execute standup explosively as one quick motion from tripod to standing
- **Recognition**: Opponent catching you mid-transition, getting stuck halfway up

## Timing Considerations

- **Optimal Conditions**: When opponent is at distance, during grip fighting exchanges, when you want to disengage
- **Avoid When**: Opponent has grips on your legs or upper body, when under immediate pressure, during their attacks
- **Setup Sequences**: After creating distance with foot positioning, following hand fighting to establish space
- **Follow-up Windows**: Must establish standing posture within 2 seconds to prevent immediate re-engagement

## Prerequisites

- **Technical Skills**: Basic body awareness, posting hand mechanics, tripod base understanding
- **Physical Preparation**: Core strength for hip elevation, leg strength for explosive standup
- **Positional Understanding**: Distance management, defensive positioning, guard concepts
- **Experience Level**: Beginner-friendly fundamental technique, essential for all levels

## Competition Applications

- **IBJJF Rules**: Legal at all belt levels, used to disengage and reset when guard position not favorable
- **No-Gi Competition**: Critical for controlling pace and choosing engagements
- **Self-Defense Context**: Essential for creating distance and regaining feet against attacker
- **MMA Applications**: Fundamental for returning to feet and avoiding extended ground fighting

## Historical Context

The technical standup is a fundamental movement taught in wrestling, judo, and sambo, and was incorporated into BJJ as a defensive essential. It represents one of the safest methods for returning to standing while maintaining defensive structure. The technique has remained largely unchanged across grappling disciplines, demonstrating its mechanical soundness and universal application.

## Safety Considerations

- **Controlled Application**: Practice with proper base to avoid falls or injuries
- **Mat Awareness**: Ensure adequate space for standup movement
- **Partner Safety**: When drilling, partner should respect the extended leg barrier
- **Gradual Progression**: Build explosiveness gradually, start with slow technical reps

## Position Integration

**Common combinations and sequences:**
- [[Half Guard Bottom]] → [[Technical Standup]] → [[Standing up]]
- [[Seated Guard]] → [[Technical Standup]] → [[Standing up]]
- [[Half Guard Bottom]] → [[Technical Standup]] → [[Wrestling Stance]]
