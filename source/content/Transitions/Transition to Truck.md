## Transition Description
Transition to Truck is an advanced offensive technique in Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu (BJJ) used to set up a submission from a dominant top position like Back Control or Turtle Position Top, targeting the opponent's legs or back with the Truck Position or Submission Setup. This technique involves isolating an opponent's leg and torso while transitioning to a unique control position that opens up attacks like the Twister or leg locks, effectively turning a controlling position into a submission opportunity. It is particularly effective against opponents who turtle or defend tightly from back control, embodying the BJJ principle of using unconventional angles and leverage to attack from superior positions. Transition to Truck is a key strategy in both gi and no-gi grappling, offering a high-skill method to transition from control to a dominant submission threat with technical, dynamic movement.

## Visual Execution Sequence
Detailed description for clear visualization of the transition in action:

Starting from Back Control or Turtle Position Top, you are on top of your opponent, controlling their back with hooks and a seatbelt grip in Back Control, or pressuring their turtle position with chest-to-back contact and grips around their waist or arms, as you remain alert for their defensive movements like rolling escapes or standing attempts while maintaining heavy pressure to keep them pinned. As you initiate the Transition to Truck, you isolate one of their legs by releasing one hook in Back Control or gripping behind their knee in Turtle Position Top, preparing to shift your body to the side while keeping your other hook or knee in place to control their torso, ensuring your upper body remains tight to prevent escapes. You begin the transition by sliding your body to the side of the isolated leg, feeling their resistance as they attempt to roll away or break your control, using your hips to pivot and swing your leg over their isolated leg, trapping it between your legs while maintaining a grip on their upper body or waist to keep them in place. With precise timing, you adjust your position to lock the Truck by rolling them slightly to their side or sitting back, sensing their reaction as they either try to free their leg, turtle tighter, or attack with their arms, while you secure their trapped leg with your legs in a figure-four configuration and control their torso with your arms to prevent escapes. Mid-transition, you maintain control by keeping your weight centered to apply pressure on their trapped leg and torso, adjusting your angle to counter their movements, as you position yourself to fully establish Truck Position by securing their leg and upper body, or prepare for a Submission Setup if they resist the initial control. You complete the Transition to Truck by locking in the Truck Position, applying pressure to their leg or back by extending your legs or leaning into their torso, or transitioning to a direct Submission Setup like the Twister or a leg lock, having successfully turned your dominant position into a threatening submission platform with technical precision. Throughout the movement, you remain aware of their defensive responses like rolling escapes, leg freeing attempts, or reversals, adjusting your grip tightness, hip angle, and weight distribution to counter their efforts, demonstrating an effective offensive technique that transforms a top control position into a dominant submission threat.

**Template**: "From Back Control or Turtle Position Top, on top of opponent, control back with hooks and seatbelt grip in Back Control, or pressure turtle with chest-to-back contact and grips around waist or arms, alert for defensive movements like rolling escapes or standing, maintain heavy pressure to pin. Initiate Transition to Truck by isolating leg, release one hook in Back Control or grip behind knee in Turtle Position Top, prepare to shift body to side, keep other hook or knee to control torso, ensure upper body tight to prevent escapes. Slide body to side of isolated leg, feel resistance as they roll away or break control, use hips to pivot, swing leg over isolated leg, trap between legs, maintain grip on upper body or waist to keep in place. Adjust position with precise timing to lock Truck by rolling slightly to side or sitting back, sense reaction as they free leg, turtle tighter, or attack with arms, secure trapped leg with figure-four legs, control torso with arms to prevent escapes. Maintain control mid-transition by keeping weight centered for pressure on trapped leg and torso, adjust angle to counter movements, position for Truck Position by securing leg and upper body or prepare Submission Setup if resisted. Complete Transition to Truck by locking Truck Position, apply pressure to leg or back by extending legs or leaning into torso, or transition to direct Submission Setup like Twister or leg lock, turn dominant position into threatening submission with technical precision. Stay aware of defensive responses like rolling escapes, leg freeing, or reversals, adjust grip tightness, hip angle, weight distribution to counter, transform top control into dominant submission threat."

## Execution Steps
1. Begin in Back Control or Turtle Position Top, maintaining awareness of the opponent's defensive movements and identifying an opportunity to isolate a leg while keeping heavy pressure to control their torso.
2. Isolate one of their legs by releasing one hook in Back Control or gripping behind their knee in Turtle Position Top, preparing to shift your body to the side while maintaining control with your other hook or knee.
3. Initiate the transition by sliding your body to the side of the isolated leg, pivoting your hips to swing your leg over their isolated leg, trapping it between your legs while keeping a grip on their upper body or waist.
4. Lock the Truck by rolling them slightly to their side or sitting back, adjusting your position to counter their resistance like rolling away or freeing their leg, while securing the trapped leg with a figure-four configuration using your legs.
5. Maintain control during the transition by keeping your weight centered to apply pressure on their trapped leg and torso, using your arms to control their upper body to prevent escapes or reversals.
6. Secure the full Truck Position by tightening your legs around their trapped leg and torso, applying pressure by extending your legs or leaning into their back, ensuring their movement is restricted.
7. Complete the Transition to Truck by either finishing a submission like the Twister in Truck Position or preparing a Submission Setup by chaining to other attacks like leg locks if they resist, having turned your control into a submission threat.
8. Remain aware of their defensive responses like rolling escapes or reversals, adapting your grip tightness, hip angle, and weight distribution to consolidate the submission position.

## Key Details
- **Leg Isolation**: Essential to trap one leg for setup.
- **Hip Pivot**: Shift body to side using hip movement for angle.
- **Leg Trapping**: Swing leg over to trap opponent's leg in figure-four.
- **Torso Control**: Maintain grip on upper body to prevent escapes.
- **Pressure Application**: Center weight to control leg and torso.
- **Control Grip**: Secure waist or arms to limit opponent's movement.
- **Counter Prevention**: Use legs and weight to block rolling or standing escapes.
- **Offensive Awareness**: Monitor for reversals or submission counters.

## Success Modifiers
Factors that influence the success rate of the transition:
- **Leg Control**: Secure grip or hook to isolate leg effectively (+10%)
- **Timing Precision**: Attacking at optimal moment of opponent's defense (+8%)
- **Hip Mobility**: Quick pivot to create side angle (+7%)
- **Figure-Four Tightness**: Tight leg control for pressure on trapped leg (+5%)
- **Experience Level**: Familiarity with advanced submission setups (+5% per skill level)

## Common Counters and Counter-Attacks
Analysis of opponent responses with success rates for counter-attacks:
- **Roll Escape** → [[Guard Recovery]] (Success Rate: 30%, Conditions: opponent rolls to escape control and recover guard)
- **Leg Freeing** → [[Turtle Position]] (Success Rate: 25%, Conditions: opponent frees trapped leg before Truck is locked)
- **Reversal Attempt** → [[Bottom Position]] (Success Rate: 20%, Conditions: opponent uses transition momentum for reversal)
- **Submission Counter** → [[Heel Hook]] (Success Rate: 15%, Conditions: opponent attacks exposed leg during transition)
- **Torso Escape** → [[Back Control Escape]] (Success Rate: 10%, Conditions: opponent breaks torso control before Truck is secured)

## Decision Logic for Transition
```
If [opponent's defense] exposes leg or weakens in turtle:
- Initiate [[Transition to Truck]] to attack leg or back (Probability: 50%)

Else if [scramble situation] offers leg isolation opportunity:
- Execute [[Transition to Truck]] for submission setup (Probability: 45%)

Else if [personal strategy] favors unconventional submission attacks:
- Attempt [[Transition to Truck]] to threaten from top (Probability: 40%)

Else if [opponent counters] with strong roll or leg freeing mid-transition:
- Adjust to [[Crucifix Position]] for alternative control (Probability: 35%)

Else if [transition fails] due to successful reversal or escape:
- Transition to [[Side Control]] to mitigate (Probability: 30%)
```

## Variants
- **Standard Transition to Truck**: Classic setup from Back Control with leg isolation.
- **Dynamic Transition to Truck**: Incorporating feints to bait reactions before trapping leg.
- **Reverse Transition to Truck**: Approaching from opposite side based on opponent's reaction.
- **Counter Transition to Truck**: Baiting turtle or escape to open Truck entry.
