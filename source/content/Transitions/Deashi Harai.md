## State Machine Content Elements

### Visual Execution Sequence
Detailed step-by-step description for clear movement sequence visualization:

From standing position with collar and sleeve control, you create forward or lateral movement with your grips, pushing or pulling to induce your opponent to step forward. As they step forward with one foot to maintain their balance or match your movement, you identify the exact moment that advancing foot is about to land but has not yet fully planted. At this precise instant when their weight is transferring onto that advancing foot, you sweep it across its path of travel using the sole of your foot, making contact on the outside or front of their ankle or lower shin. The sweep motion is horizontal and crosses in front of their supporting leg as you simultaneously pull with your grips in the direction of the sweep. The combination of removing their advancing foot mid-step and pulling them forward-sideways creates complete off-balance, causing them to fall in the direction of the sweep. You maintain grip control throughout and follow through to land in a dominant top position such as side control or knee on belly.

**Template**: "From standing with collar-sleeve grips, create movement to induce forward step. As opponent's foot advances, sweep it across its path using sole of your foot during landing phase. Pull with grips in sweep direction simultaneously. Follow through to dominant top position maintaining control."

### Execution Steps (Numbered Sequence)
1. **Setup Requirements**: Establish strong collar and sleeve grips from standing position
2. **Initial Movement**: Create forward or lateral movement to induce opponent stepping
3. **Opponent Response**: Opponent steps forward with one foot to maintain balance
4. **Adaptation**: Identify which foot is advancing and time the sweep
5. **Completion**: Sweep advancing foot across with sole of your foot as it lands
6. **Consolidation**: Pull with grips in sweep direction to complete takedown

### Key Technical Details
Critical elements that determine success:
- **Grip Requirements**: Strong collar and sleeve control to create and direct movement
- **Base/Foundation**: Maintaining own balance while executing sweep
- **Timing Windows**: Sweep must contact foot during landing phase before full plant
- **Leverage Points**: Sole of foot contact combined with grip pull creates off-balance
- **Common Adjustments**: Vary sweep angle based on opponent's stepping direction

### Success Modifiers
Factors that increase/decrease probability:
- **Setup Quality**: Creating effective forward movement pattern (+/-15%)
- **Timing Precision**: Executing sweep during exact landing moment (+/-25%)
- **Opponent Fatigue**: Reduced balance and defensive reactions (+/-5%)
- **Knowledge Test Performance**: Understanding timing principles (+/-10%)
- **Position Control**: Quality of grip control and pulling direction (+/-15%)

## Counter-Attack Analysis

### Common Counters
Opponent responses with success rates:
- **Quick Plant**: Planting advancing foot quickly before sweep → [[Standing Position]] (Success Rate: 30%, Conditions: anticipation)
- **Step Through**: Stepping through sweep with other foot → [[Clinch Position]] (Success Rate: 35%, Conditions: good footwork)
- **Counter Sweep**: Using sweep momentum for own takedown → [[Top Position]] (Success Rate: 20%, Conditions: superior timing)
- **Pull Guard**: Sitting to guard when off-balanced → [[Guard Bottom]] (Success Rate: 25%, Conditions: defensive choice)

Format: `[[Counter Technique]] → [[Result State]] (Success Rate: X%, Conditions: [when applicable])`

### Decision Logic
```
If [sweep timing] is anticipated:
- Execute [[Quick Plant]] (Probability: 30%)

Else if [footwork] allows step through:
- Execute [[Step Through]] (Probability: 35%)

Else if [defensive option] is available:
- Execute [[Pull Guard]] (Probability: 25%)

Else if [momentum can be redirected]:
- Execute [[Counter Sweep]] (Probability: 20%)

Else [optimal sweep execution]:
- Accept transition (Probability: Success Rate - Modifiers)
```

## Educational Content

### Expert Insights
Commentary as if from recognized authorities:
- **John Danaher**: "Deashi harai is perhaps the most fundamental of all foot sweeps, teaching the core principle of removing base during the most vulnerable moment - mid-step. The advancing foot is inherently weak because weight is transferring onto it but hasn't yet established a stable platform. Your sweep doesn't need power because you're attacking during a moment of inherent weakness. This demonstrates the principle that perfect timing can overcome any amount of strength."
- **Gordon Ryan**: "In competition, deashi harai is my go-to foot sweep because it has the highest success rate when timed correctly. I create forward pressure with my grips to force them to step, then sweep the advancing foot. The key is recognizing which foot will advance based on your grip pressure. It's pattern recognition at high speed - once you learn to see it, the opportunity appears constantly."
- **Eddie Bravo**: "Deashi harai works beautifully in no-gi because it doesn't rely on gi grips for the actual sweep mechanics. The sweep itself is all timing and foot placement. In our system, we use it to create takedown entries or to set up guard pulls when the sweep is defended. The low-risk nature makes it perfect for chaining multiple attacks together without exhausting yourself."

Each insight should focus on one key technical or strategic element.

### Common Errors
For knowledge test generation:
- **Error**: Sweeping too early before foot advances
- **Why It Fails**: Foot hasn't moved yet so sweep has no effect
- **Correction**: Wait for advancing foot to be in motion before sweeping
- **Recognition**: Sweep misses completely or hits stationary foot

- **Error**: Sweeping too late after foot is planted
- **Why It Fails**: Weight is already established on planted foot
- **Correction**: Time sweep for exact moment of landing before full plant
- **Recognition**: Sweep feels heavy and opponent easily maintains balance

- **Error**: Not pulling with grips in sweep direction
- **Why It Fails**: Lacks coordinated force to complete off-balance
- **Correction**: Pull with grips simultaneously with foot sweep
- **Recognition**: Opponent recovers balance despite foot contact

### Timing Considerations
When to attempt this transition:
- **Optimal Conditions**: When opponent is moving forward or responding to your pressure
- **Avoid When**: Opponent is stationary or moving backward
- **Setup Sequences**: After creating forward movement pattern with grips
- **Follow-up Windows**: Can chain multiple sweep attempts on successive steps

### Prerequisites
Requirements before attempting:
- **Technical Skills**: Basic standing grip fighting and timing recognition
- **Physical Preparation**: Balance and hip mobility for sweeping motion
- **Positional Understanding**: Standing position mechanics and movement patterns
- **Experience Level**: Beginner-friendly technique, excellent first foot sweep to learn
