# Mount to Armbar
#bjj #transition #mount #armbar #submission

## Transition Properties
- **Transition ID**: T907
- **Starting State**: [[Mount]]
- **Ending State**: [[Armbar Control]]
- **Success Probability**: Beginner (40%), Intermediate (65%), Advanced (85%)
- **Execution Complexity**: Medium to High
- **Physical Attributes**: Hip Mobility, Core Control, Grip Strength
- **Risk Level**: Medium - sacrifices positional security for submission opportunity
- **Energy Cost**: Medium - requires controlled movement and weight shifts
- **Transition Type**: Positional to Submission Control

## Transition Description
The Mount to Armbar transition represents a critical offensive sequence that converts a dominant positional control (Mount) into a submission control position (Armbar Control). This transition leverages mechanical advantages created by the mount's superior positioning to isolate an opponent's arm and establish the precise alignment necessary for joint manipulation. Unlike maintaining mount for control, this transition sacrifices some positional security to pursue a submission finish, embodying the tactical decision-making that defines high-level BJJ. The technical execution focuses on isolating the defending arm while maintaining sufficient control throughout the movement phase to prevent defensive escapes, exemplifying BJJ's principle of progressive control leading to submission opportunity.

## Visual Execution Sequence
Detailed description for clear visualization of the transition in action:

From a secure mount position atop your opponent, your knees pinch their ribs, hips heavy on their torso, and hands ready to control, you begin by establishing weight distribution to prevent their bridge, with your chest over their centerline. You create arm isolation by attacking their collar with your left hand or applying cross-face pressure with your shoulder, forcing their right arm to frame defensively, then capture it at the wrist with your right hand, securing a tight grip to prevent retraction. You elevate your body weight by posting your left hand on the mat near their head, shifting into an S-mount-like position to isolate their arm further, maintaining pressure to block their escape attempts. With control secured, you swing your right leg over their head in a fluid motion, pivoting on your posted hand, ensuring your grip on their wrist remains unbroken as your leg clears their face. You adjust your hips perpendicular to their arm alignment, sitting back towards their shoulder, your left leg sliding under their neck to form a triangle with your right leg over their chest. You settle into the final armbar control position, hips aligned with their elbow joint, maintaining wrist control with both hands to prevent hitchhiker escapes, ready to apply breaking pressure. Throughout, you manage your base to counter their defensive rolls or bridges, ensuring control continuity by never releasing their arm until the submission setup is complete, demonstrating the precision of this high-percentage transition.

**Template**: "From mount, knees pinch ribs, hips heavy, hands ready, chest over centerline. Isolate arm with collar attack or cross-face, capture wrist with tight grip. Elevate weight, post hand near head, shift to S-mount to isolate further. Swing leg over head, pivot on posted hand, maintain wrist grip. Adjust hips perpendicular, sit back to shoulder, slide other leg under neck for triangle. Settle into armbar control, hips at elbow, hands secure wrist. Manage base against rolls, ensure control continuity until setup complete."

## Execution Steps
1. Establish a secure mount position with appropriate weight distribution, knees pinching opponent's ribs and hips heavy on their torso to prevent bridging.
2. Create arm isolation by attacking their collar or applying cross-face pressure, forcing a defensive frame, then capture the targeted arm at the wrist or sleeve with a firm grip.
3. Elevate body weight by posting with the non-control hand on the mat near their head, shifting into an intermediate S-mount position to further isolate the arm.
4. Swing the leg on the same side as the controlled arm over the opponent's head, pivoting on the posted hand while maintaining unbroken grip security on their wrist.
5. Adjust hips to a perpendicular alignment relative to the opponent's arm, sitting back towards their shoulder to establish mechanical advantage for the armbar.
6. Establish a leg triangle by sliding the other leg under their neck or over their chest, locking the position to isolate their arm and head together.
7. Settle into the final armbar control position with proper hip placement at their elbow joint, securing both hands on their wrist, ready to apply breaking pressure while managing base against counters.

## Key Details
- **Arm Isolation**: Forcing defensive arm exposure through strategic pressure like collar attacks or cross-face.
- **Weight Shift**: Progressive redistribution from full mount to a transitional S-mount for better control.
- **Hip Positioning**: Critical elevation and pivot of hips before and during the leg swing for leverage.
- **Grip Security**: Maintaining constant control of the target arm throughout the transition to prevent escapes.
- **Space Management**: Strategic posting with the free hand to prevent defensive bridging or rolling.
- **Leg Swing Mechanics**: Precise trajectory of the leg over the opponent's head to avoid losing position.
- **Alignment Principles**: Achieving perpendicular final position relative to the opponent's arm for optimal breaking mechanics.
- **Control Continuity**: Ensuring uninterrupted control sequence despite positional changes by securing new control points before releasing old ones.

## Success Modifiers
Factors that influence the success rate of the transition:
- **Arm Isolation Quality**: Effectiveness of initial arm control before transition (+15%)
- **Weight Distribution Control**: Proper shifting to prevent opponent escapes during movement (+10%)
- **Hip Mobility**: Ability to elevate and pivot hips fluidly for positioning (+10%)
- **Grip Strength**: Maintaining secure control of opponent's wrist throughout (+10%)
- **Experience Level**: Familiarity with mount control and armbar mechanics (+5% per skill level)

## Common Counters and Counter-Attacks
Analysis of opponent responses with success rates for counter-attacks after the transition:
- [[Bridge and Roll]] → [[Guard Recovery]] (Success Rate: 40%, Conditions: opponent bridges explosively during weight shift)
- [[Hitchhiker Escape]] → [[Top Position Recovery]] (Success Rate: 35%, Conditions: opponent rotates thumb to escape armbar grip)
- [[Defensive Frame]] → [[Failed Isolation]] (Success Rate: 30%, Conditions: opponent frames early to prevent arm isolation)
- [[Stack Counter]] → [[Positional Reversal]] (Success Rate: 25%, Conditions: opponent stacks weight forward to disrupt armbar setup)
- [[Hand Fighting]] → [[Guard Recovery]] (Success Rate: 45%, Conditions: opponent fights wrist control before leg swing)
- [[Roll to Knees]] → [[Turtle Position]] (Success Rate: 20%, Conditions: opponent rolls to knees during transition to escape)

## Decision Logic for Opponent Behavior
```
If [opponent bridges explosively] during weight shift:
- Adjust [[Base Management]] to counter with posted hand (Probability: 60%)

Else if [opponent rotates thumb] for hitchhiker escape:
- Reinforce [[Grip Security]] and adjust hip pressure (Probability: 55%)

Else if [opponent frames early] to prevent isolation:
- Use [[Cross-Face Pressure]] to break frame (Probability: 50%)

Else if [opponent stacks forward] to disrupt setup:
- Transition to [[Return to Mount]] if armbar fails (Probability: 45%)

Else if [opponent fights wrist grip] before leg swing:
- Apply [[Control Maintenance]] to distract and secure grip (Probability: 40%)

Else if [opponent rolls to knees] during transition:
- Follow to [[Back Control]] or maintain top pressure (Probability: 35%)

Else [maintain control]:
- Proceed with standard [[Leg Swing Mechanics]] (Probability: 70%)
```

## Variants
- S-Mount Armbar Entry (using S-mount as an intermediate position for enhanced isolation)
- Gift Wrap Armbar (entering through gift wrap control for tighter arm security)
- High Mount Armbar (emphasizing high mount positioning for superior arm isolation)
- Far Side Armbar (attacking the arm
