# Single Leg Entry
#bjj #transition #takedown #wrestling #single_leg

## Visual Execution Sequence

From standing position, you establish grip control while maintaining good posture and head position. You create an opening through hand fighting or feinting, causing your opponent to react or create space. You execute a level change by dropping your hips and bending your knees while maintaining an upright back. Your lead leg steps deep between or outside their legs as you drive forward with your head positioning outside their hip. Your arms wrap around their isolated leg, one hand behind the knee and one at the ankle or calf. You complete the entry by securing the leg close to your chest, establishing single leg control with proper head pressure and body positioning to prevent them from hopping away or defending effectively.

**One-Sentence Summary**: "From standing with collar and sleeve control, you level change explosively while stepping deep, wrapping arms around their isolated leg to establish single leg control."

## Execution Steps

1. **Setup Requirements**: Establish standing grips (collar/sleeve or underhooks), maintain good posture with head up and back straight
2. **Initial Movement**: Create opening through hand fighting or feint motion to draw reaction or create opening
3. **Level Change**: Drop hips rapidly by bending knees while keeping back straight, preparing to penetrate
4. **Penetration Step**: Step deep with lead leg between or outside opponent's legs while driving forward
5. **Leg Capture**: Wrap arms around isolated leg with hands behind knee and at ankle, securing it
6. **Consolidation**: Pull leg tight to chest with head outside hip, establish control preventing escape

## Key Technical Details

- **Grip Requirements**: Initial grips on collar/sleeve or wrists, transitioning to leg wrap during entry
- **Base/Foundation**: Level change with bent knees and straight back, not bending at waist which telegraphs intent
- **Timing Windows**: Execute when opponent extends leg forward, shifts weight, or is off-balance
- **Leverage Points**: Head pressure outside hip prevents circling, arms secure leg close to body
- **Common Adjustments**: Adjust head position and leg grip based on opponent's stance and defensive reactions

## Common Counters

Opponent defensive responses with success rates and conditions:

- **[[Sprawl Defense]]** → [[Standing]] (Success Rate: 55%, Conditions: opponent sprawls hips back before penetration completes)
- **[[Whizzer Counter]]** → [[Front Headlock]]** (Success Rate: 45%, Conditions: opponent overhooks arm preventing full leg control)
- **[[Crossface Counter]]** → [[Standing]] (Success Rate: 40%, Conditions: opponent controls head pushing it across body)
- **[[Hopping Defense]]** → [[Standing]] (Success Rate: 50%, Conditions: opponent hops away on free leg if control weak)

### Decision Logic for AI Opponent

```
If [penetration depth] < 50%:
- Execute [[Sprawl Defense]] (Probability: 55%)

Else if [arm is exposed to overhook]:
- Execute [[Whizzer Counter]] (Probability: 45%)

Else if [head position vulnerable]:
- Execute [[Crossface Counter]] (Probability: 40%)

Else [leg control established]:
- Accept transition (Probability: Base Success Rate + Applied Modifiers)
```

## Expert Insights

### John Danaher
"The single leg entry is fundamentally about achieving a deep penetration angle while maintaining structural integrity. The level change must be explosive yet controlled - dropping your hips changes your center of gravity allowing you to drive underneath theirs. Critical is the head position outside the hip, which prevents them from circling away and gives you the leverage to off-balance. The leg capture must be immediate and tight."

### Gordon Ryan
"In competition, I use the single leg entry off my collar tie when opponents try to circle or back away. The key is timing the level change when they step forward or shift weight - that's when their base is compromised. I prefer securing the leg high, near the hip crease, because it gives me more control options for finishing the takedown. The initial grip fighting is crucial to create the opening."

### Eddie Bravo
"The single leg entry is money for setting up multiple positions, not just the takedown. If they defend well, you can transition to other attacks like going to the back or switching to a double leg. I teach it as part of a takedown system where you chain attacks together. The key is staying committed once you shoot - hesitation gets you sprawled on."

## Common Errors

### Error 1: Telegraphing the level change by dropping hands or looking down
- **Why It Fails**: Opponent sees shot coming and has time to sprawl or defend effectively
- **Correction**: Maintain grip contact and head position until the moment of level change, explode suddenly
- **Recognition**: Getting sprawled on repeatedly, opponent always ready for your shot

### Error 2: Bending at waist instead of dropping hips with bent knees
- **Why It Fails**: Creates weak posture making it easy to sprawl on, reduces driving power
- **Correction**: Keep back straight and drop hips by bending knees deeply, like sitting into a squat
- **Recognition**: Feeling weak during penetration, getting driven down by opponent's pressure

### Error 3: Not stepping deep enough during penetration
- **Why It Fails**: Shallow penetration allows opponent to hop away or circle out easily
- **Correction**: Lead leg must step at least between their legs, ideally beside or past their far leg
- **Recognition**: Opponent easily escaping by hopping away, unable to secure leg properly

### Error 4: Poor head position allowing opponent to circle away
- **Why It Fails**: Head inside or not tight to hip gives opponent angle to turn and escape
- **Correction**: Drive head outside their hip and maintain pressure throughout entry
- **Recognition**: Opponent constantly circling away despite having leg captured

### Error 5: Failing to secure leg tight to chest immediately
- **Why It Fails**: Loose leg control allows opponent to retract leg or counter attack
- **Correction**: Pull captured leg tight to chest immediately upon wrapping arms around it
- **Recognition**: Opponent pulling leg free or countering before control established

## Timing Considerations

- **Optimal Conditions**: When opponent steps forward, shifts weight, has narrow stance, or is extended in grip fighting
- **Avoid When**: Opponent has wide stable base with hips back, when you're off-balance or fatigued
- **Setup Sequences**: After snap down brings posture down, from arm drag creating angle, after collar tie creates opening
- **Follow-up Windows**: Must establish control within 2-3 seconds or opponent will defend successfully

## Prerequisites

- **Technical Skills**: Level change mechanics, penetration step footwork, basic wrestling stance and movement
- **Physical Preparation**: Hip flexibility for deep level change, leg strength for explosive penetration, conditioning for sustained pressure
- **Positional Understanding**: Standing grappling concepts, distance management, grip fighting fundamentals
- **Experience Level**: Beginner-friendly entry, fundamental technique for all levels

   - **Answer**: B

## Variants and Adaptations

- **Gi Specific**: Use sleeve and collar grips to control posture and create openings, pants grip on leg for additional control
- **No-Gi Specific**: Use wrist control or underhooks for setups, body lock around leg without gi grips
- **Self-Defense**: Highly applicable for street situations, effective against untrained opponents, close distance safely
- **Competition**: Essential technique in wrestling and submission grappling, sets up multiple takedown finishes
- **Size Differential**: Smaller practitioners benefit from speed and angle, larger practitioners use power and reach

## Training Progressions

1. **Solo Practice**: Shadow wrestling with level change mechanics, penetration step footwork patterns without partner
2. **Cooperative Drilling**: Partner allows entry completion for repetition and muscle memory development
3. **Resistant Practice**: Partner provides progressive defensive reactions including sprawl and whizzer
4. **Sparring Integration**: Attempt entries during live standing grappling, develop timing and setup recognition
5. **Troubleshooting**: Identify and correct specific problems like telegraphing, shallow penetration, or poor head position

## Competition Applications

- **IBJJF Rules**: Legal at all belt levels, essential for takedown scoring (2 points)
- **No-Gi Competition**: Highly effective without gi grips preventing entry, fundamental wrestling technique
- **Self-Defense Context**: Excellent for safely closing distance and taking down attacker
- **MMA Applications**: Essential takedown entry in mixed martial arts, sets up ground control

## Historical Context

The single leg takedown entry is one of the most fundamental techniques in wrestling, with origins dating back to ancient Greco-Roman wrestling. It became a cornerstone of freestyle and folkstyle wrestling in the 20th century and was adopted into Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu as practitioners recognized the importance of takedown skills. The technique remains one of the highest percentage entries in both wrestling and BJJ competition, favored for its relative safety and multiple finishing options once control is established.

## Safety Considerations

- **Controlled Application**: Execute with control to avoid knee injuries to opponent during entry
- **Mat Awareness**: Ensure adequate space for movement and potential takedown completion
- **Partner Safety**: Communicate during drilling, especially when resisting or defending entry
- **Gradual Progression**: Build up speed and power gradually, master mechanics before adding intensity

## Position Integration

**Common combinations and sequences:**
- [[Standing]] → [[Single Leg Entry]] → [[Single Leg Control]]
- [[Collar Tie]] → [[Single Leg Entry]] → [[Single Leg Finish]]
- [[Standing]] → [[Single Leg Entry]] → [[Double Leg Transition]] (if defended)
- [[Arm Drag]] → [[Single Leg Entry]] → [[Back Take]] (if whizzered)

## Related Techniques

- [[Double Leg Entry]] - Alternative takedown entry with similar level change mechanics
- [[Snap Down]] - Setup technique that creates openings for single leg entry
- [[Arm Drag]] - Creates angle advantageous for single leg entry
- [[Sprawl Defense]] - Primary defense against single leg entry that must be understood
