# Spider Guard Sweeps

## Visual Execution Sequence

From spider guard with feet on opponent's biceps and strong sleeve grips, you have multiple sweeping options based on their posture and base. You can use scissor-style sweeps when they're upright, pushing one leg while pulling the other to create rotational off-balance. Against forward pressure, you can use their momentum to roll them overhead. When they're square, you can push both legs to create space then sweep. Each variation manipulates their arms as control points while your legs create the off-balancing force, using their own grip structure against them.

**One-Sentence Summary**: "From spider guard with feet on biceps and sleeve grips, multiple sweep variations use leg push-pull mechanics to off-balance opponent based on their posture."

## Execution Steps

1. **Setup Requirements**: Establish spider guard with feet on biceps; secure strong sleeve grips; assess opponent's posture and base
2. **Initial Movement**: Choose sweep variation based on posture - scissor action for upright, overhead roll for forward pressure, or push-pull for square
3. **Opponent Response**: Opponent attempts to maintain posture, remove feet from biceps, or break grips
4. **Adaptation**: Adjust leg pressure and angles; maintain grip control; switch variations based on defense
5. **Completion**: Complete selected sweep; follow opponent to mat; establish top position
6. **Consolidation**: Secure mount, side control, or knee on belly; maintain control over opponent

## Key Technical Details

- **Grip Requirements**: Strong bilateral sleeve grips essential; don't release until sweep completes
- **Base/Foundation**: Legs on biceps create distance control and leverage points; mobile hips for angle creation
- **Timing Windows**: Attack when opponent's base is narrow, weight forward, or during their adjustment
- **Leverage Points**: Feet on biceps as push-pull levers; sleeve grips prevent base recovery
- **Common Adjustments**: Vary leg angles; combine with lasso or de la riva hooks; chain sweeps together

## Expert Insights

### John Danaher
"Spider guard sweeps work by manipulating the opponent's arm structure. With your feet on their biceps and strong sleeve control, you've essentially created a system where their own arms become liability. They can't effectively base with arms you're controlling. The sweeps are about reading which direction their base is weakest - if they're upright, sweep sideways; if they're forward, use that momentum to roll them over."

### Gordon Ryan
"I don't use spider guard much because it requires gi grips, but when I do, the sweeps are high-percentage because of how much control you have. The key is making them choose between maintaining posture and keeping their base. Push one leg, they base there, you sweep the other direction. It's a game of action-reaction where you control the tempo."

### Eddie Bravo
"Spider guard isn't part of 10th Planet because we're no-gi, but the concepts translate - any guard where you control limbs and create distance gives you sweeping options. The spider guard does this perfectly with the gi. The sweeps work because you're controlling their arms while your legs create off-balancing force. It's technical rather than strength-based, which makes it accessible to smaller practitioners."

## Common Errors

### Error 1: Weak Sleeve Grips
- **Why It Fails**: Without strong grips, opponent easily removes feet and passes
- **Correction**: Maintain deep, tight sleeve grips throughout; don't release until sweep completes
- **Recognition**: Opponent easily removes feet from biceps; losing control

### Error 2: Static Leg Position
- **Why It Fails**: Feet staying in same position allows opponent to adapt and maintain base
- **Correction**: Constantly adjust leg angles and pressure; create dynamic off-balancing
- **Recognition**: Opponent comfortable in spider guard; maintaining solid base

### Error 3: Not Following Sweep
- **Why It Fails**: Successfully off-balancing opponent but not following through allows recovery
- **Correction**: Immediately follow sweep motion; come up to top position before they recover
- **Recognition**: Opponent tips but recovers to guard; missing follow-up

## Timing Considerations

- **Optimal Conditions**: When opponent is upright with narrow base; during their passing attempts; when they're grip fighting
- **Avoid When**: Opponent has very wide, low base; they've broken your grips; your legs are fatigued
- **Setup Sequences**: After establishing spider guard; following grip fighting exchanges; during their adjustment moments
- **Follow-up Windows**: Must follow sweep within 1-2 seconds to prevent recovery

## Prerequisites

- **Technical Skills**: Spider guard establishment; sleeve grip control; leg dexterity; sweep mechanics
- **Physical Preparation**: Hip flexibility for leg positioning; grip strength; core strength
- **Positional Understanding**: Spider guard principles; gi grip strategies; base destruction concepts
- **Experience Level**: Intermediate to advanced; requires good guard control and timing

## Knowledge Assessment

1. **Mechanical Understanding**: "What creates the control in spider guard sweeps?"
   - A) Only the feet on biceps
   - B) Combination of sleeve grips controlling arms and legs creating off-balancing leverage
   - C) Pure strength
   - D) Speed alone
   - **Answer**: B

2. **Timing Recognition**: "When is the optimal time to execute spider guard sweeps?"
   - A) When opponent has very wide base
   - B) When you have no grips
   - C) When opponent is upright with narrow base or during their passing attempts
   - D) Never
   - **Answer**: C

3. **Error Prevention**: "What is the most common mistake with spider guard sweeps?"
   - A) Maintaining grips too well
   - B) Weak sleeve grips that allow opponent to remove feet easily
   - C) Too much leg pressure
   - D) Following sweeps too quickly
   - **Answer**: B

4. **Setup Requirements**: "What must be maintained throughout spider guard sweeps?"
   - A) No grips
   - B) Strong sleeve grips and feet pressure on biceps
   - C) Distance from opponent
   - D) Closed legs
   - **Answer**: B

5. **Adaptation**: "If opponent removes one foot from bicep, what should you do?"
   - A) Give up completely
   - B) Force foot back to same position
   - C) Transition to different guard variation or adjust spider configuration
   - D) Stand up
   - **Answer**: C

## Variants and Adaptations

- **Gi Specific**: Requires gi for sleeve grips; primary context for spider guard
- **No-Gi Specific**: N/A - spider guard is gi-specific
- **Self-Defense**: Limited application in self-defense context
- **Competition**: High-level gi competition technique; effective for point scoring
- **Size Differential**: Particularly effective for smaller practitioners against larger opponents

## Training Progressions

1. **Solo Practice**: Practice leg positioning and hip movement
2. **Cooperative Drilling**: Partner allows sweeps to learn mechanics
3. **Resistant Practice**: Partner provides realistic defense and passing attempts
4. **Sparring Integration**: Use spider guard sweeps in live rolling
5. **Troubleshooting**: Identify which sweeps work against which defenses
