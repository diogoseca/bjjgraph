# Ghost Escape
#bjj #transition #escape #side_control #advanced

## Visual Execution Sequence

From side control bottom position, you begin by creating a frame with your inside elbow against opponent's hip while your outside hand controls their far shoulder or neck. You explosively bridge and turn toward your outside shoulder, creating space under your hips. As you bridge, you simultaneously pull your inside knee toward your chest and shoot it underneath your body in a circular motion. Your body performs a rolling motion similar to a shoulder roll or granby, with your inside shoulder and upper back making contact with the mat. You continue the rotational momentum, bringing your hips through the space you've created, essentially "ghosting" out from underneath their control. Your body emerges on the opposite side in turtle position or on all fours, having escaped by rotating underneath and through where your body previously was. The movement is fluid and dynamic, requiring precise timing and coordination to slip through before the opponent can react and reestablish control.

**One-Sentence Summary**: "From side control bottom, you bridge and rotate toward your outside shoulder while shooting your inside knee underneath in a rolling motion, ghosting through to turtle position."

## Execution Steps

1. **Setup Requirements**: Establish inside elbow frame on opponent's hip, outside hand controlling far shoulder or neck
2. **Initial Movement**: Bridge explosively while turning toward outside shoulder, creating space under hips
3. **Knee Insertion**: Pull inside knee toward chest and shoot it underneath body in circular motion
4. **Rolling Motion**: Execute shoulder roll/granby bringing inside shoulder and upper back to mat
5. **Hip Escape**: Continue rotational momentum bringing hips through the created space
6. **Consolidation**: Emerge on opposite side in turtle position, immediately establish defensive posture

## Key Technical Details

- **Grip Requirements**: Inside elbow frame prevents opponent from following, outside hand assists directional control
- **Base/Foundation**: Explosive bridge creates the initial space for rotation to occur
- **Timing Windows**: Execute during opponent's weight shifts or position adjustments
- **Leverage Points**: Rotation uses opponent's pressure against them as you slip underneath
- **Common Adjustments**: Adjust speed and angle of rotation based on opponent's base and pressure

## Common Counters

Opponent defensive responses with success rates and conditions:

- **[[Cross Face Control]]** → [[Side Control]] (Success Rate: 60%, Conditions: opponent controls head preventing rotation)
- **[[Back Take]]** → [[Back Control]] (Success Rate: 55%, Conditions: opponent capitalizes on exposed back during rotation)
- **[[North-South Transition]]** → [[North-South]] (Success Rate: 50%, Conditions: opponent follows rotation and reestablishes control)
- **[[Scramble]]** → [[Neutral Position]] (Success Rate: 45%, Conditions: both competitors enter scramble situation)

### Decision Logic for AI Opponent

```
If [rotation_speed] < 60%:
- Execute [[Cross Face Control]] (Probability: 60%)

Else if [back is exposed]:
- Execute [[Back Take]] (Probability: 55%)

Else if [can follow rotation]:
- Execute [[North-South Transition]] (Probability: 50%)

Else [optimal execution conditions]:
- Accept transition (Probability: Base Success Rate + Applied Modifiers)
```

## Expert Insights

### John Danaher
"The ghost escape represents an advanced level of escaping mechanics that prioritizes movement quality over raw strength. The rotation must be performed at precisely the right moment when the opponent's base is vulnerable. The key is generating enough rotational momentum while maintaining a compact body position. Most people fail because they try to muscle through it instead of using timing and angular movement to slip through the available space."

### Gordon Ryan
"In competition, I use the ghost escape when traditional shrimping escapes aren't available due to opponent's pressure or positioning. The timing is extremely critical - you need to feel when their weight shifts even slightly, then explode into the rotation. I've found it particularly effective against opponents who drive heavy chest pressure, as you can use their forward momentum to facilitate your rotation. The speed of execution is what makes it work - hesitation equals failure."

### Eddie Bravo
"The ghost escape embodies the movement-based philosophy of modern BJJ. It's called the ghost because you literally disappear from underneath them if done correctly. I teach it as part of our movement curriculum because it develops body awareness and fluidity. The granby roll component is essential - you need to be comfortable inverting and rotating. Once you master the mechanics, it becomes one of the most reliable escapes because it's so difficult for opponents to follow or counter."

## Common Errors

### Error 1: Insufficient bridge creating inadequate space for rotation
- **Why It Fails**: Without proper space, rotation is blocked and movement fails
- **Correction**: Generate explosive bridge creating maximum space under hips before rotating
- **Recognition**: Getting stuck during rotation, unable to complete the rolling motion

### Error 2: Slow or hesitant execution lacking explosiveness
- **Why It Fails**: Gradual movement allows opponent to follow and reestablish control
- **Correction**: Execute entire sequence explosively as one continuous fluid motion
- **Recognition**: Opponent easily tracking your movement and maintaining control

### Error 3: Not pulling inside knee tight to chest during rotation
- **Why It Fails**: Extended knee prevents compact body position needed for rotation
- **Correction**: Pull knee tightly to chest, making body as compact as possible
- **Recognition**: Knee catching on opponent's body, rotation feeling clumsy

### Error 4: Incorrect shoulder roll angle or direction
- **Why It Fails**: Wrong angle sends you into opponent instead of away from them
- **Correction**: Roll toward outside shoulder, directing movement away from opponent's base
- **Recognition**: Rolling into opponent rather than escaping, ending up in worse position

### Error 5: Stopping in turtle without establishing defensive posture
- **Why It Fails**: Emerging without defensive structure allows immediate back attack
- **Correction**: Immediately establish strong turtle with hands protecting neck and elbows in
- **Recognition**: Getting back taken immediately after escaping side control

## Timing Considerations

- **Optimal Conditions**: When opponent's weight shifts forward, during position transitions, when they reach for submissions
- **Avoid When**: Under maximum crushing pressure with no space, when opponent has deep crossface control
- **Setup Sequences**: After creating frame space, when opponent adjusts grips, during their position advancement attempts
- **Follow-up Windows**: Must complete rotation within 2 seconds before opponent adjusts

## Prerequisites

- **Technical Skills**: Granby roll ability, shoulder rolling mechanics, shrimping foundation, body awareness
- **Physical Preparation**: Hip flexibility for rotation, shoulder mobility for rolling, core strength for movement
- **Positional Understanding**: Side control escape concepts, turtle defense, rotational movement patterns
- **Experience Level**: Intermediate-advanced technique requiring significant movement skill

- **Self-Defense**: Limited application for street scenarios, primarily sport technique
- **Competition**: Highly effective in sport BJJ when traditional escapes are shut down
- **Size Differential**: Smaller practitioners with flexibility advantage can execute more easily

## Training Progressions

1. **Solo Practice**: Granby roll drills, shoulder roll repetitions, movement flow practice
2. **Cooperative Drilling**: Partner maintains light side control while you practice rotation slowly
3. **Resistant Practice**: Partner provides progressive pressure testing timing and explosiveness
4. **Sparring Integration**: Attempt during live rolling when traditional escapes unavailable
5. **Troubleshooting**: Identify rotation angle issues, timing problems, or speed deficiencies

## Competition Applications

- **IBJJF Rules**: Legal at all belt levels, escaping side control prevents opponent points and position advancement
- **No-Gi Competition**: Highly effective when traditional escapes are shut down by pressure
- **Self-Defense Context**: Limited practical application for street scenarios
- **MMA Applications**: Useful for creating scrambles and avoiding extended ground control

## Historical Context

The ghost escape emerged in modern sport BJJ as practitioners developed more movement-based escaping systems. The technique draws from wrestling's granby roll and combines it with BJJ's emphasis on hip escape mechanics. It gained popularity through competitors like Marcelo Garcia and was further developed by movement specialists. The name "ghost" comes from the way the practitioner seems to vanish from underneath the opponent's control.

## Safety Considerations

- **Controlled Application**: Practice rotation slowly initially to avoid neck or shoulder strain
- **Mat Awareness**: Ensure adequate mat space for rolling motion
- **Partner Safety**: When drilling, top partner should allow escape to complete
- **Gradual Progression**: Build up speed and explosiveness gradually, master mechanics first

## Position Integration

**Common combinations and sequences:**
- [[Side Control Bottom]] → [[Ghost Escape]] → [[Turtle Position]]
- [[Side Control Bottom]] → [[Ghost Escape]] → [[Side Control to Mount]]
- [[North-South Bottom]] → [[Ghost Escape]] → [[Turtle Position]]
