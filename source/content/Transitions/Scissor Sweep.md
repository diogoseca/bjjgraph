- **Ending State**: [[Mount]], [[Top Position]]
- **Transition Type**: Attack - categorizes transition purpose

### Transition Properties
- **Success Probability**: Beginner 55%, Intermediate 75%, Advanced 90% - core probability data
- **Execution Complexity**: Low - technical difficulty assessment
- **Energy Cost**: Low - physical demand of execution
- **Time Required**: Quick - duration of transition
- **Risk Level**: Low - chance of backfire or position loss

### Physical Requirements
- **Strength Requirements**: Low for leg and core muscles
- **Flexibility Requirements**: Medium for leg positioning and hip movement
- **Coordination Requirements**: Medium for technical precision
- **Speed Requirements**: Medium for timing-dependent execution

## State Machine Content Elements

### Visual Execution Sequence
Detailed step-by-step description for clear movement sequence visualization:

From closed guard bottom, you establish a strong collar grip with one hand while your other hand controls their same-side sleeve at the elbow. Your opponent typically maintains their posture or attempts to establish grips. You then open your guard and create a scissor motion with your legs - one leg sweeping across their base while the other leg blocks their opposite leg. The coordinated push-pull motion with your grips combined with the leg scissor creates an unstoppable sweeping force that topples them to the side as you follow through, ending up in mount position.

**Template**: "From closed guard with collar-sleeve grips, you open guard and create scissor motion with legs while pulling with collar and pushing with sleeve. Your opponent is swept to the side as you follow through to mount position."

### Execution Steps (Numbered Sequence)
1. **Setup Requirements**: Establish collar grip and same-side sleeve control from closed guard
2. **Initial Movement**: Open your guard while maintaining grip control
3. **Opponent Response**: Opponent typically tries to maintain base or advance position
4. **Adaptation**: Adjust leg positioning and grip tension based on their movement
5. **Completion**: Execute scissor motion while pulling collar and pushing sleeve
6. **Consolidation**: Follow through by transitioning to mount position

### Key Technical Details
Critical elements that determine success:
- **Grip Requirements**: Strong collar grip, elbow control on same side
- **Base/Foundation**: Proper leg positioning for effective scissor motion
- **Timing Windows**: Execute when opponent's base is centered or advancing
- **Leverage Points**: Combined push-pull with grips amplifies leg scissor force
- **Common Adjustments**: Vary scissor angle and grip direction based on resistance

### Success Modifiers
Factors that increase/decrease probability:
- **Setup Quality**: Strong grips and proper leg positioning (+/-15%)
- **Timing Precision**: Executing during optimal base position (+/-20%)
- **Opponent Fatigue**: Reduced defensive reactions and balance (+/-5%)
- **Knowledge Test Performance**: Understanding sweep mechanics (+/-10%)
- **Position Control**: Quality of initial closed guard control (+/-10%)

## Counter-Attack Analysis

### Common Counters
Opponent responses with success rates:
- **Base Widening**: Widening base to prevent scissor effectiveness → [[Closed Guard Top]] (Success Rate: 45%, Conditions: early recognition)
- **Grip Break**: Breaking collar or sleeve grip to neutralize control → [[Open Guard]] (Success Rate: 40%, Conditions: superior grip fighting)
- **Drive Forward**: Pressuring forward to pass before sweep → [[Guard Pass]] (Success Rate: 35%, Conditions: timing dependent)
- **Post Hand**: Posting hand to prevent rollover completion → [[Closed Guard Top]] (Success Rate: 50%, Conditions: quick reaction)

Format: `[[Counter Technique]] → [[Result State]] (Success Rate: X%, Conditions: [when applicable])`

### Decision Logic
```
If [scissor setup] is recognized early:
- Execute [[Base Widening]] (Probability: 45%)

Else if [grips are not secure]:
- Execute [[Grip Break]] (Probability: 40%)

Else if [sweep can be beaten with speed]:
- Execute [[Drive Forward]] (Probability: 35%)

Else [optimal sweep execution]:
- Accept transition (Probability: Success Rate - Modifiers)
```

## Educational Content

### Expert Insights
Commentary as if from recognized authorities:
- **John Danaher**: "The scissor sweep is the most fundamental and highest-percentage sweep from closed guard. The key is understanding the precise coordination between upper body control and leg scissor motion. The push-pull action with the grips must be perfectly timed with the leg scissor to create irresistible force that makes defense nearly impossible."
- **Gordon Ryan**: "In competition, I rely on the scissor sweep as my primary weapon from closed guard because of its exceptional success rate and low energy cost. The technique is so mechanically sound that when executed properly, even elite opponents cannot defend it. The immediate transition to mount makes it extremely valuable for point scoring."
- **Eddie Bravo**: "The scissor sweep is the foundation that all other closed guard techniques build upon. I teach it as the first sweep because mastering its mechanics teaches students proper grip control, hip movement, and the timing required for all guard work. It's the technique that proves closed guard is a truly dominant position."

Each insight should focus on one key technical or strategic element.

### Common Errors
For knowledge test generation:
- **Error**: Attempting sweep without proper collar and sleeve grips
- **Why It Fails**: Lack of upper body control reduces sweep effectiveness dramatically
- **Correction**: Always establish strong collar grip and elbow control before opening guard
- **Recognition**: Sweep feels weak and opponent maintains balance easily

- **Error**: Poor leg positioning that reduces scissor effectiveness
- **Why It Fails**: Incorrect leg angles fail to create proper sweeping force
- **Correction**: Bottom leg sweeps across their base, top leg blocks at knee level
- **Recognition**: Opponent easily steps over or around the leg sweep

- **Error**: Not coordinating grips with leg motion properly
- **Why It Fails**: Legs and arms working independently reduces total force generated
- **Correction**: Pull collar and push sleeve precisely as legs execute scissor
- **Recognition**: Sweep lacks power despite good leg positioning

### Timing Considerations
When to attempt this transition:
- **Optimal Conditions**: When opponent has centered base or is advancing forward
- **Avoid When**: Opponent has wide, low base with strong defensive posture
- **Setup Sequences**: After opponent defends other attacks and returns to center
- **Follow-up Windows**: Must complete within 1-2 seconds for maximum effectiveness

### Prerequisites
Requirements before attempting:
- **Technical Skills**: Basic closed guard control and fundamental grip fighting
- **Physical Preparation**: Hip flexibility and basic leg coordination
- **Positional Understanding**: Closed guard mechanics and sweep principles
- **Experience Level**: Beginner-friendly technique, often first sweep taught

## Technical Assessment Elements

### Knowledge Assessment Questions
5 technical questions with multiple choice answers:
- **Mechanical Understanding**: "What creates the sweeping force in the scissor sweep?"
- **Timing Recognition**: "When is the optimal moment to execute the leg scissor?"
- **Error Prevention**: "What is the most common grip mistake in this technique?"
- **Setup Requirements**: "Which leg position is essential for proper execution?"
- **Adaptation**: "How do you adjust if opponent widens their base?"

### Variants and Adaptations
Different versions for various scenarios:
- **Gi Specific**: Traditional collar and sleeve grips provide maximum control
- **No-Gi Specific**: Adapt to overhook and underhook control instead
- **Self-Defense**: Modified version using clothing grips in street situations
- **Competition**: Perfect technique for reliable point scoring and position
- **Size Differential**: Effective for all body types due to mechanical advantage

### Training Progressions
Skill development pathway:
- **Solo Practice**: Leg scissor motion and grip simulation without partner
- **Cooperative Drilling**: Partner allows sweep completion for timing development
- **Resistant Practice**: Partner provides progressive defensive resistance
- **Sparring Integration**: Implementing sweep during live rolling sessions
- **Troubleshooting**: Identifying and correcting execution problems

## Audio & Narration Elements
