## State Machine Content Elements

### Visual Execution Sequence
Detailed step-by-step description for clear movement sequence visualization:

From the Closed Guard Bottom position, you start on your back with your legs locked around the opponent's waist, feet crossed behind their back, maintaining a tight grip to control their upper body, typically with one hand on their collar and the other on their sleeve or wrist to prevent them from posturing up. As the opponent attempts to stand or break your guard, you reinforce your grip on their collar or neck, pulling them down with both hands to break their posture, ensuring their head is low and their weight is forward, while simultaneously trapping one of their arms by pulling it across your centerline to limit their ability to base out. You plant one foot on the mat on the same side as their trapped arm, using it as a leverage point, while your other leg remains wrapped around their waist to maintain guard control, and shift your hips slightly to the side of the trapped arm to create an off-balancing angle. With a powerful hip thrust, you drive upward and to the side, using your planted foot to push off the mat, while pulling their upper body down and across with your grips, rolling them over their trapped arm and shoulder towards the direction of your planted foot, following through with your momentum to come up on top as they land on their back. You establish a dominant position such as mount or top position, maintaining control of their upper body or legs to prevent immediate guard recovery, securing the sweep with chest pressure and positional awareness.

**Template**: "From Closed Guard Bottom, lock legs around opponent's waist, grip collar and sleeve. Pull down with grips to break posture, trap one arm across centerline. Plant foot on mat same side as trapped arm, shift hips for angle. Thrust hips up and to side, pull upper body across, roll opponent over trapped arm. Secure mount or top position with control and pressure."

### Execution Steps (Numbered Sequence)
1. **Setup Requirements**: Start in Closed Guard Bottom with legs locked around opponent's waist
2. **Grip Control**: Secure strong grips on opponent's collar and sleeve or wrist
3. **Posture Break**: Pull down with both hands to disrupt opponent's posture
4. **Arm Trap**: Pull one arm across centerline to limit opponent's base
5. **Foot Placement**: Plant foot on mat on same side as trapped arm for leverage
6. **Hip Shift**: Move hips slightly to side of trapped arm for off-balancing angle
7. **Sweep Initiation**: Thrust hips upward and to side, push off with planted foot
8. **Follow Through**: Pull upper body across, roll opponent over trapped arm to top
9. **Position Secure**: Establish mount or top position with control and pressure

### Key Technical Details
Critical elements that determine success:
- **Posture Control**: Breaking opponent's posture to keep their weight forward
- **Arm Trap**: Isolating one arm across centerline to prevent basing out
- **Foot Leverage**: Planting foot on mat for powerful push-off
- **Hip Thrust**: Strong upward and lateral hip movement for sweep momentum
- **Timing**: Coordinating grip pull and hip thrust for effective roll

### Success Modifiers
Factors that increase/decrease probability:
- **Posture Break Effectiveness**: Degree of opponent's posture disruption (+/-20%)
- **Arm Trap Quality**: Control over opponent's trapped arm (+/-15%)
- **Hip Thrust Power**: Strength and angle of hip movement (+/-15%)
- **Opponent Weight Distribution**: Catching opponent during forward lean (+/-10%)
- **Knowledge Test Performance**: Understanding closed guard sweep mechanics (+/-10%)

## Counter-Attack Analysis

### Common Counters
Opponent responses with success rates:
- **Posture Recovery**: Regaining upright posture to resist pull → [[Closed Guard Top]] (Success Rate: 45%, Conditions: early recognition)
- **Arm Withdrawal**: Freeing trapped arm to base out → [[Neutral Position]] (Success Rate: 35%, Conditions: quick reaction)
- **Base Widening**: Adjusting legs to prevent roll → [[Top Position]] (Success Rate: 30%, Conditions: strong base)
- **Counter Pressure**: Driving weight forward to flatten sweeper → [[Bottom Position]] (Success Rate: 20%, Conditions: advanced skill)

Format: `[[Counter Technique]] → [[Result State]] (Success Rate: X%, Conditions: [when applicable])`

### Decision Logic
```
If [sweep setup] is recognized early:
- Execute [[Posture Recovery]] (Probability: 45%)

Else if [trapped arm] can be freed quickly:
- Execute [[Arm Withdrawal]] (Probability: 35%)

Else if [base] is strong for resistance:
- Attempt [[Base Widening]] (Probability: 30%)

Else [skill level] allows for counterattack:
- Attempt [[Counter Pressure]] (Probability: 20%)

Else [optimal execution]:
- Accept transition (Probability: Success Rate - Modifiers)
```

## Educational Content

### Expert Insights
Commentary as if from recognized authorities:
- **John Danaher**: "The Muscle Sweep is a fundamental closed guard technique that exemplifies the power of posture control and hip movement in sweeps. The key lies in trapping the arm and using a strong hip thrust to create the necessary leverage for the roll. This technique teaches essential principles of off-balancing and timing that are foundational for all guard sweeps."
- **Gordon Ryan**: "In competition, the Muscle Sweep is a reliable option from closed guard, especially against opponents who try to stand or posture aggressively. I focus on breaking their posture hard and driving with my hips to ensure the sweep, often landing in mount for maximum control. The technique demonstrates how basic moves can be highly effective with proper execution."
- **Eddie Bravo**: "Muscle Sweep is a classic closed guard sweep that integrates well with fundamental guard systems, offering a straightforward path to reverse position. It’s a great move for beginners to build confidence in sweeping, and advanced players can use it as a setup for more complex attacks. This sweep is perfect for grapplers who want to develop a strong, power-based guard game."

Each insight should focus on one key technical or strategic element.

### Common Errors
For knowledge test generation:
- **Error**: Insufficient posture break or grip control
- **Why It Fails**: Allows opponent to maintain balance and resist sweep
- **Correction**: Secure strong collar and sleeve grips, pull down with force
- **Recognition**: Opponent's upper body remains upright during attempt

- **Error**: Poor arm trap or isolation
- **Why It Fails**: Opponent can base out with trapped arm, preventing roll
- **Correction**: Pull arm across centerline, keep it controlled with grip
- **Recognition**: Opponent uses arm to post and stop sweep momentum

- **Error**: Weak hip thrust or incorrect angle
- **Why It Fails**: Lacks power or leverage to roll opponent over
- **Correction**: Drive hips upward and to side of trapped arm, push off planted foot
- **Recognition**: Sweep stalls or opponent counters with weight adjustment

### Timing Considerations
When to attempt this transition:
- **Optimal Conditions**: When opponent stands or leans forward in closed guard
- **Avoid When**: Opponent maintains low, defensive posture with strong base
- **Setup Sequences**: After establishing closed guard with grip control
- **Follow-up Windows**: Must complete sweep within 3-5 seconds to avoid counters

### Prerequisites
Requirements before attempting:
- **Technical Skills**: Understanding of closed guard control and sweep mechanics
- **Physical Preparation**: Hip strength and core power for thrust
- **Positional Understanding**: Control points in closed guard bottom
- **Experience Level**: Beginner to Intermediate - fundamental sweep technique
