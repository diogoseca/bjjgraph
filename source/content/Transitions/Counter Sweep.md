## State Machine Content Elements

### Visual Execution Sequence
Detailed step-by-step description for clear movement sequence visualization:

From guard top position, you recognize the early warning signs of your opponent's impending sweep attempt through their grip changes, weight shifts, or body positioning. As they initiate the sweep, committing their momentum to the technique, you make a split-second defensive decision based on the sweep's direction and mechanics. You can either establish a strong defensive base by posting your hand or leg to prevent the rollover, redirect their sweeping momentum by moving with it then countering back, or immediately advance to a more dominant position as their sweep creates space. The key is reading their commitment point - once they're fully invested in the sweep direction, their balance becomes vulnerable to counters. You use their momentum against them, either maintaining your top position through solid base or reversing the sweep to achieve an even more dominant control position like side control or mount.

**Template**: "Recognize opponent's sweep attempt through positional cues. As they commit, either base out defensively or redirect their momentum into counter position. Establish dominant control."

### Execution Steps (Numbered Sequence)
1. **Setup Requirements**: Recognize opponent's sweep attempt through grip fighting and positional cues
2. **Initial Movement**: Begin defensive base adjustment or counter-movement as sweep initiates
3. **Opponent Response**: Opponent commits to sweep execution with full momentum
4. **Adaptation**: Use opponent's sweeping momentum against them by redirecting or reversing
5. **Completion**: Complete counter by either maintaining position or reversing to more dominant control
6. **Consolidation**: Establish control in maintained or improved position

### Key Technical Details
Critical elements that determine success:
- **Grip Requirements**: Break or control opponent's grips that enable sweep mechanics
- **Base/Foundation**: Establish wide, strong base or move dynamically with opponent's momentum
- **Timing Windows**: React during opponent's commitment phase, not after sweep completion
- **Leverage Points**: Use opponent's extended limbs or committed momentum as counter leverage
- **Common Adjustments**: Different counter strategies for different sweep types (hip bump vs. scissor vs. butterfly)

### Success Modifiers
Factors that increase/decrease probability:
- **Setup Quality**: Early recognition of sweep attempt (+/-20%)
- **Timing Precision**: Reacting at optimal moment during sweep execution (+/-25%)
- **Opponent Fatigue**: Slower sweep execution and weaker mechanics (+/-5%)
- **Knowledge Test Performance**: Understanding sweep mechanics and counter principles (+/-15%)
- **Position Control**: Quality of your base and posture before sweep attempt (+/-15%)

## Counter-Attack Analysis

### Common Counters
Opponent responses with success rates:
- **Sweep Completion**: Committing harder to sweep before counter activates → [[Top to Bottom]] (Success Rate: 60%, Conditions: counter timing is late)
- **Alternative Sweep**: Switching to different sweep when first is defended → [[Different Sweep]] (Success Rate: 50%, Conditions: chaining sweeps)
- **Submission Setup**: Attacking limbs during counter attempt → [[Submission Position]] (Success Rate: 35%, Conditions: over-commitment to counter)
- **Re-Guard**: Accepting failed sweep and returning to defensive guard → [[Guard Position]] (Success Rate: 45%, Conditions: recognizing failed attempt)

Format: `[[Counter Technique]] → [[Result State]] (Success Rate: X%, Conditions: [when applicable])`

### Decision Logic
```
If [counter recognition] is late:
- Execute [[Sweep Completion]] (Probability: 60%)

Else if [counter creates] new sweep opening:
- Execute [[Alternative Sweep]] (Probability: 50%)

Else if [counter over-commitment] occurs:
- Execute [[Submission Setup]] (Probability: 35%)

Else [effective counter]:
- Accept counter (Probability: Success Rate - Modifiers)
```

## Educational Content

### Expert Insights
Commentary as if from recognized authorities:
- **John Danaher**: "Counter sweeps are fundamentally about reading commitment and using momentum against your opponent. Every sweep requires the bottom player to commit their body weight and momentum in a specific direction - this commitment creates vulnerability. The key is recognizing the commitment phase early enough to react, but late enough that they cannot easily abort the sweep. Understanding the mechanics of common sweeps allows you to position your base preemptively, making counters nearly automatic."
- **Gordon Ryan**: "In competition, I'm constantly feeling for sweep attempts through grip fighting and weight distribution changes. The moment I sense a sweep coming, I'm already preparing my counter. Against high-level opponents, you need multiple counter options for each sweep type - some sweeps you base out of, others you redirect and reverse. The worst thing you can do is freeze or react slowly. Decisive action, even if not perfect, is better than hesitation."
- **Eddie Bravo**: "Counter sweeps are about flow and reading energy. I teach my students to feel the direction of force and either redirect it or establish structure against it. Many sweeps can be countered by simply moving your hips away from the sweeping vector or advancing into a pass as they create space. The 10th Planet philosophy emphasizes being comfortable in scrambles that result from sweep attempts - sometimes the best counter is accepting the transition into a scramble where you can use your technical ability."

Each insight should focus on one key technical or strategic element.

### Common Errors
For knowledge test generation:
- **Error**: Reacting too late after sweep is already in motion
- **Why It Fails**: Once sweep has momentum, countering becomes exponentially harder
- **Correction**: Develop early recognition of sweep setups through grip and position awareness
- **Recognition**: Consistently getting swept before counter attempt begins

- **Error**: Fighting against sweep momentum with pure strength
- **Why It Fails**: Momentum and leverage favor the sweeping player, strength alone insufficient
- **Correction**: Use base positioning, timing, or momentum redirection rather than strength
- **Recognition**: Expending maximum effort but still getting swept

- **Error**: Over-committing to counter and creating submission opportunities
- **Why It Fails**: Extended limbs and off-balance positions vulnerable to attacks
- **Correction**: Maintain defensive awareness even while countering sweep attempts
- **Recognition**: Frequently getting caught in submissions while attempting to counter sweeps

- **Error**: Using same counter response for all sweep types
- **Why It Fails**: Different sweeps require different counter mechanics
- **Correction**: Learn specific counters for major sweep categories (lateral, rotational, forward)
- **Recognition**: Counter works sometimes but fails against certain sweep types

- **Error**: Neglecting grip fighting before sweep attempt
- **Why It Fails**: Strong grips enable sweep mechanics and limit counter options
- **Correction**: Break problematic grips early, before sweep can be launched
- **Recognition**: Finding yourself with no good counter options due to opponent's grip control

### Timing Considerations
When to attempt this transition:
- **Optimal Conditions**: Early recognition of sweep setup through grip changes and positional cues
- **Avoid When**: Sweep is already past commitment phase and has momentum
- **Setup Sequences**: Proactive grip breaking and base positioning before sweep attempts
- **Follow-up Windows**: Must complete counter within 1-2 seconds of sweep initiation

### Prerequisites
Requirements before attempting:
- **Technical Skills**: Understanding of common sweep mechanics and counter principles
- **Physical Preparation**: Core strength and balance for base maintenance
