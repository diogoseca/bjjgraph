## State Machine Content Elements

### Visual Execution Sequence
Detailed step-by-step description for clear movement sequence visualization:

From your single leg control position with the opponent's leg captured and secured, you close the distance by driving your chest into their body, eliminating any space between you. You elevate their captured leg while maintaining tight control, creating an off-balance situation where they must hop on their standing leg. As they struggle to maintain balance, you drive forward with explosive power, forcing them backward. Depending on their reaction, you execute one of several finishing variations - running the pipe (driving through while lifting), sweeping the standing leg, or dumping them by angling off. You follow them to the ground while maintaining leg control, ensuring you land in a dominant top position. As they hit the mat, you immediately establish passing position or side control to consolidate your advantage.

**Template**: "From single leg control, close distance and elevate leg to create off-balance, drive forward explosively, finish with run-the-pipe or sweep variation, follow to ground maintaining control, establish top position."

### Execution Steps (Numbered Sequence)
1. **Secure Leg Control**: Establish strong grip and control on opponent's captured leg
2. **Close Distance**: Drive forward to eliminate space between your chest and opponent's body
3. **Off-Balance Opponent**: Create off-balancing by elevating leg and driving forward pressure
4. **Execute Finish**: Complete takedown using run-the-pipe, sweep, or dump variation
5. **Control Landing**: Follow opponent to ground while maintaining leg control
6. **Establish Position**: Transition to top control in passing position or side control

### Key Technical Details
Critical elements that determine success:
- **Grip Requirements**: Strong leg control with hands locked or double grip on leg
- **Base/Foundation**: Solid base on your standing legs for driving power
- **Timing Windows**: Finish must be executed within 3-5 seconds of securing leg
- **Leverage Points**: Leg elevation combined with forward chest pressure creates off-balance
- **Common Adjustments**: Vary finishing method based on opponent's defensive reaction

### Success Modifiers
Factors that increase/decrease probability:
- **Leg Control Quality**: Tight grips and proper leg positioning (+/-15%)
- **Distance Management**: Chest-to-body contact elimination of space (+/-12%)
- **Elevation Height**: Lifting captured leg high enough (+/-10%)
- **Forward Drive**: Explosive penetration and pressure (+/-10%)
- **Finish Selection**: Choosing appropriate variation for situation (+/-8%)

## Counter-Attack Analysis

### Common Counters
Opponent responses with success rates:
- **Whizzer Defense**: Overhook on attacking arm to prevent finish → [[Whizzer Control]] (Success Rate: 55%, Conditions: early recognition)
- **Sprawl**: Dropping hips and weight to prevent elevation → [[Front Headlock]] (Success Rate: 50%, Conditions: timing dependent)
- **Guillotine**: Attacking neck during takedown attempt → [[Guillotine Control]] (Success Rate: 40%, Conditions: head exposed)
- **Hop Away**: Using standing leg to create distance → [[Standing Position]] (Success Rate: 45%, Conditions: space available)

Format: `[[Counter Technique]] → [[Result State]] (Success Rate: X%, Conditions: [when applicable])`

### Decision Logic
```
If [leg control] is loose:
- Execute [[Sprawl]] (Probability: 50%)

Else if [attacker's head] is high:
- Execute [[Guillotine]] (Probability: 40%)

Else if [distance] is maintained:
- Execute [[Whizzer Defense]] (Probability: 55%)

Else [optimal finish execution]:
- Accept transition (Probability: Success Rate - Modifiers)
```

## Educational Content

### Expert Insights
Commentary as if from recognized authorities:
- **John Danaher**: "The single leg finish is fundamentally about eliminating the opponent's base by controlling one leg while applying forward pressure that overwhelms their remaining support point. The mechanical principle is simple but requires precise execution: you must close the distance completely so your chest is tight to their body, then elevate the captured leg high enough that their standing leg cannot maintain balance. The finish variation you choose depends entirely on their defensive reaction - if they hop backward, run the pipe; if they base wide, sweep the standing leg; if they angle off, dump them in the direction they're moving."
- **Gordon Ryan**: "In competition, the single leg finish is about speed and commitment. Once I have the leg, I'm closing distance immediately and driving through without hesitation. The biggest mistake people make is holding the leg at distance and waiting - that gives the opponent time to establish defensive positions like the whizzer or guillotine. I focus on the run-the-pipe finish most often because it's highest percentage when executed properly. The key is keeping my head tight to their body and driving my shoulder through their center line while lifting the leg - this creates an irresistible off-balancing force."
- **Eddie Bravo**: "From the 10th Planet wrestling integration perspective, we drill single leg finishes constantly because they're essential for our aggressive guard pulling entries and scramble situations. The single leg is one of those techniques where athletic commitment matters as much as technical precision. When teaching finishes, I emphasize reading the opponent's weight distribution and balance - if they're leaning back, run through them; if they're squared up, sweep the standing leg. We also work on transitioning immediately to leg attacks if the takedown finish fails, turning a defensive situation into an offensive leg lock entry."

Each insight should focus on one key technical or strategic element.

### Common Errors
For knowledge test generation:
- **Error**: Maintaining distance between chest and opponent's body
- **Why It Fails**: Creates leverage for opponent to defend and establish counters
- **Correction**: Drive chest tight to opponent's body immediately after securing leg
- **Recognition**: Opponent easily establishing whizzer or guillotine defenses

- **Error**: Failing to elevate captured leg high enough
- **Why It Fails**: Opponent maintains balance on standing leg without difficulty
- **Correction**: Lift captured leg to at least hip height or higher for effective off-balance
- **Recognition**: Opponent standing stable despite forward driving pressure

- **Error**: Hesitating after securing leg control
- **Why It Fails**: Gives opponent time to establish defensive positions and counters
- **Correction**: Immediate transition from leg capture to finish attempt
- **Recognition**: Opponent setting up whizzer, guillotine, or sprawl defenses

- **Error**: Using only upper body strength to finish
- **Why It Fails**: Insufficient power and leaves standing leg vulnerable to sweeps
- **Correction**: Drive through with legs and hips for full body power generation
- **Recognition**: Feeling weak or unable to move opponent despite effort

- **Error**: Losing leg control during finishing drive
- **Why It Fails**: Opponent escapes and reverses position or creates scramble
- **Correction**: Maintain tight grips throughout entire finishing sequence
- **Recognition**: Opponent's leg slipping out during takedown attempt

### Timing Considerations
When to attempt this transition:
- **Optimal Conditions**: Immediately after securing clean leg control with good positioning
- **Avoid When**: Opponent has established strong whizzer or guillotine before finish
- **Setup Sequences**: After snap down, level change, or failed guard pull by opponent
- **Follow-up Windows**: Must establish top position within 1-2 seconds after takedown

### Prerequisites
