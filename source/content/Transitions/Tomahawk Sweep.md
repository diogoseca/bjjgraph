## State Machine Content Elements

### Visual Execution Sequence
Detailed step-by-step description for clear movement sequence visualization:

From an open guard position, you face the opponent with active legs and grips, typically controlling their sleeves or wrists while maintaining a strong frame with your feet on their hips or biceps to manage distance and prevent passes. As the opponent attempts to pass your guard by stepping to one side or driving forward, you initiate the Tomahawk Sweep by shifting your hips to create an angle, pulling one of their arms across your body with your grip while simultaneously swinging your outside leg down and across their far leg, aiming to hook behind their knee or ankle. Using your core and hip mobility, you drive your hooked leg upward and inward in a 'chopping' motion, mimicking a tomahawk swing, to off-balance the opponent and disrupt their base, while pulling with your grip to guide their upper body into the sweep. You then roll over your shoulder or hip, following the momentum of the sweep, to come up on top, maintaining control of their arm and leg to prevent a scramble. Immediately after completing the sweep, you establish a dominant top position such as mount or side control, securing control with chest pressure and arm isolation to solidify your advantage.

**Template**: "From open guard, control opponent's sleeves with feet on hips or biceps to manage distance. Shift hips to angle as they pass, pull arm across body, swing outside leg to hook far leg. Drive hooked leg up in chopping motion to off-balance, roll over shoulder to come on top, then establish dominant position like mount or side control."

### Execution Steps (Numbered Sequence)
1. **Setup Requirements**: Engage in open guard with active legs and grips
2. **Grip Establishment**: Control opponent's sleeves or wrists for leverage
3. **Distance Management**: Place feet on hips or biceps to frame and prevent passes
4. **Opponent Response**: Opponent attempts to pass by stepping or driving forward
5. **Hip Adjustment**: Shift hips to create angle for sweep on passing side
6. **Arm Control**: Pull opponent's arm across body with grip to guide movement
7. **Leg Hook**: Swing outside leg down and across to hook behind far knee or ankle
8. **Sweep Execution**: Drive hooked leg up and in with chopping motion to off-balance
9. **Follow Through**: Roll over shoulder or hip to come on top, establish top position

### Key Technical Details
Critical elements that determine success:
- **Grip Control**: Secure sleeve or wrist grips to manipulate opponent's upper body
- **Hip Mobility**: Shift hips to create optimal angle for sweep initiation
- **Leg Hook**: Accurate placement behind opponent's far leg for leverage
- **Chopping Motion**: Upward and inward drive to disrupt opponent's base
- **Momentum Follow**: Roll with sweep momentum to secure top position

### Success Modifiers
Factors that increase/decrease probability:
- **Grip Quality**: Strength and control of sleeve or wrist grips (+/-15%)
- **Opponent Momentum**: Capitalizing on passing attempt or forward pressure (+/-20%)
- **Timing Precision**: Executing at the right moment of weight shift (+/-15%)
- **Hip Drive**: Effective use of core and hip mobility for sweep (+/-10%)
- **Knowledge Test Performance**: Understanding open guard sweep mechanics (+/-10%)

## Counter-Attack Analysis

### Common Counters
Opponent responses with success rates:
- **Base Adjustment**: Widening stance to resist sweep → [[Open Guard Top]] (Success Rate: 50%, Conditions: early recognition)
- **Arm Withdrawal**: Freeing controlled arm to regain balance → [[Neutral Position]] (Success Rate: 40%, Conditions: quick reaction)
- **Hip Pressure**: Driving hips down to block sweep → [[Guard Pass]] (Success Rate: 35%, Conditions: strong posture)
- **Counter Sweep**: Using momentum for own sweep → [[Bottom Position]] (Success Rate: 25%, Conditions: advanced skill)

Format: `[[Counter Technique]] → [[Result State]] (Success Rate: X%, Conditions: [when applicable])`

### Decision Logic
```
If [sweep setup] is recognized early:
- Execute [[Base Adjustment]] (Probability: 50%)

Else if [arm control] can be broken quickly:
- Execute [[Arm Withdrawal]] (Probability: 40%)

Else if [posture] is strong for resistance:
- Attempt [[Hip Pressure]] (Probability: 35%)

Else [skill level] allows for counterattack:
- Attempt [[Counter Sweep]] (Probability: 25%)

Else [optimal execution]:
- Accept transition (Probability: Success Rate - Modifiers)
```

## Educational Content

### Expert Insights
Commentary as if from recognized authorities:
- **John Danaher**: "The Tomahawk Sweep is a dynamic open guard technique that leverages precise hip movement and leg control to reverse position against a passing opponent. The key lies in the chopping motion of the leg to disrupt their base, creating an opportunity to come on top. This sweep teaches critical principles of angle creation and momentum that apply to all guard systems."
- **Gordon Ryan**: "In competition, the Tomahawk Sweep can be a high-percentage move to catch opponents during their guard pass attempts. I use it to capitalize on their forward momentum, quickly transitioning from bottom to top with control. The technique shows how open guard can be an offensive platform with the right timing."
- **Eddie Bravo**: "Tomahawk Sweep integrates seamlessly with modern guard play and can be chained with other sweeps or submissions if it fails. It often surprises opponents who aren't expecting the unique leg hook and chopping action, creating openings for dominance. This move highlights how creative guard sweeps can dominate in BJJ."

Each insight should focus on one key technical or strategic element.

### Common Errors
For knowledge test generation:
- **Error**: Mistiming the hip shift and sweep initiation
- **Why It Fails**: Allows opponent to maintain balance and resist sweep
- **Correction**: Wait for opponent's passing movement before shifting hips and sweeping
- **Recognition**: Opponent stays upright or easily adjusts base during attempt

- **Error**: Insufficient grip or arm control
- **Why It Fails**: Fails to guide opponent's upper body into the sweep
- **Correction**: Secure strong sleeve or wrist grips before initiating sweep
- **Recognition**: Opponent easily pulls arm back or counters with posture

- **Error**: Poor leg hook placement or chopping motion
- **Why It Fails**: Reduces leverage to off-balance opponent effectively
- **Correction**: Ensure leg hooks behind far knee or ankle with upward drive
- **Recognition**: Sweep feels ineffective or opponent steps out of hook

### Timing Considerations
When to attempt this transition:
- **Optimal Conditions**: When opponent attempts to pass guard with forward momentum
- **Avoid When**: Opponent maintains strong defensive posture or low base
- **Setup Sequences**: After establishing open guard with active grips and frames
- **Follow-up Windows**: Must complete sweep within 3-5 seconds to avoid counters

### Prerequisites
Requirements before attempting:
- **Technical Skills**: Understanding of open guard principles and sweep mechanics
- **Physical Preparation**: Hip flexibility and core strength for mobility
- **Positional Understanding**: Control points in open guard position
- **Experience Level**: Intermediate - requires timing and coordination
