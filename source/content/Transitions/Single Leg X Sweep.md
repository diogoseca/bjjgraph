## State Machine Content Elements

### Visual Execution Sequence
Detailed step-by-step description for clear movement sequence visualization:

From Single Leg X Guard position, you have one leg hooked behind the opponent's knee (your inside leg) while your other leg has the foot placed on their hip or thigh (your outside leg). Your arms typically control their trapped leg with grips on the pants or ankle. The opponent stands upright trying to maintain balance on one leg while you control the other. You execute the sweep by simultaneously pulling their trapped leg towards you with your leg hook and grips while extending your hip-positioned foot to push them off balance. The combined pulling and pushing forces create a rotational off-balance that topples them to the side or backward as you follow through by coming up on top, resulting in a top position with you in control and them on their back or side.

**One-Sentence Summary**: "From Single Leg X Guard with leg hook and hip control, you pull their trapped leg while pushing with your foot to sweep them, coming up on top in control position."

### Execution Steps (Numbered Sequence)
1. **Setup Requirements**: Establish Single Leg X Guard with one leg hooking behind opponent's knee and other foot on their hip
2. **Initial Movement**: Pull opponent's trapped leg close while extending your hip-foot to create off-balance
3. **Opponent Response**: Opponent typically attempts to base out with free leg or hands to prevent sweep
4. **Adaptation**: Adjust leg hook pressure and timing based on their balance and base reactions
5. **Completion**: Complete sweeping motion by pulling trapped leg while pushing with hip-foot to topple them
6. **Consolidation**: Follow through by coming up on top and securing control position immediately

### Key Technical Details
Critical elements that determine success:
- **Grip Requirements**: Control of trapped leg with grips on pants, ankle, or foot for directional control
- **Base/Foundation**: Strong leg hook behind knee combined with hip-foot pressure creates leverage system
- **Timing Windows**: Execute when opponent's weight is centered on trapped leg or they're attempting to step
- **Leverage Points**: Leg hook pulls while hip-foot pushes, creating rotational off-balance vector
- **Common Adjustments**: Vary pulling angle and pushing direction based on opponent's base and weight distribution

### Success Modifiers
Factors that increase/decrease probability:
- **Setup Quality**: Tight leg hook and proper foot placement on hip (+/-15%)
- **Timing Precision**: Executing when opponent's weight is on trapped leg (+/-20%)
- **Opponent Fatigue**: Reduced balance and base strength (+/-10%)
- **Knowledge Test Performance**: Understanding sweep mechanics and angles (+/-10%)
- **Position Control**: Quality of Single Leg X Guard maintenance (+/-10%)

## Counter-Attack Analysis

### Common Counters
Opponent responses with success rates:
- **Step Over Defense**: Stepping free leg over your body to create angle → [[Top Position]] (Success Rate: 45%, Conditions: early recognition and mobility)
- **Limp Leg Escape**: Making trapped leg heavy and dropping weight → [[Defensive Position]] (Success Rate: 40%, Conditions: proper weight distribution)
- **Back Step Counter**: Stepping back with free leg to establish base → [[Standing Guard]] (Success Rate: 50%, Conditions: quick reaction time)
- **Sprawl Defense**: Driving hips forward and sprawling to neutralize hooks → [[Guard Pass]] (Success Rate: 35%, Conditions: explosive timing)

Format: `[[Counter Technique]] → [[Result State]] (Success Rate: X%, Conditions: [when applicable])`

### Decision Logic
```
If [leg hook control] < 50%:
- Execute [[Limp Leg Escape]] (Probability: 40%)

Else if [sweep timing] is telegraphed early:
- Execute [[Step Over Defense]] (Probability: 45%)

Else if [opponent has superior base]:
- Execute [[Back Step Counter]] (Probability: 50%)

Else [optimal sweep execution]:
- Accept transition (Probability: Success Rate - Modifiers)
```

## Educational Content

### Expert Insights
Commentary as if from recognized authorities:
- **John Danaher**: "The Single Leg X sweep is mechanically efficient because it creates a two-directional force system where you pull the opponent's base while simultaneously pushing them off balance. The key is understanding that the sweep succeeds through rotational force rather than pure strength. The leg hook behind the knee acts as a fulcrum point while your hip-foot creates the pushing force that rotates them over their trapped leg. Most practitioners fail by pulling without pushing or vice versa, but the combination of both forces is what creates the inevitable off-balance."
- **Gordon Ryan**: "In no-gi competition, I use Single Leg X sweeps constantly because they're low-risk and high-percentage when timed correctly. The critical moment is when the opponent has their weight centered on the trapped leg, either because they're trying to step forward or because they're attempting to pass. I emphasize being patient in Single Leg X and not forcing the sweep until the timing is optimal. The sweep can lead directly to back takes or top positions, making it a versatile offensive tool."
- **Eddie Bravo**: "Single Leg X integrates well with the 10th Planet leg lock system because it sets up both sweeps and leg lock entries. I teach students to view Single Leg X as a control position with multiple attacks rather than just a sweeping position. The sweep itself is powerful but it's even better when combined with leg lock threats that force opponents into compromised positions where the sweep becomes easier."

Each insight should focus on one key technical or strategic element.

### Common Errors
For knowledge test generation:
- **Error**: Insufficient leg hook depth behind knee
- **Why It Fails**: Shallow hook allows opponent to extract their leg easily, eliminating sweep control
- **Correction**: Drive your leg hook deep behind their knee, hugging it tightly to prevent extraction
- **Recognition**: Notice if their leg feels loose or they can easily step out of your hook

- **Error**: Pushing without pulling or pulling without pushing
- **Why It Fails**: Single-directional force is insufficient to off-balance opponent with proper base
- **Correction**: Coordinate simultaneous pulling with leg hook and pushing with hip-foot for rotational force
- **Recognition**: Sweep feels weak or opponent doesn't move significantly despite effort

- **Error**: Attempting sweep while opponent's weight is on free leg
- **Why It Fails**: Their weight and base are on the uncontrolled leg, making them stable and resistant
- **Correction**: Wait for or create moment when their weight shifts to trapped leg before initiating sweep
- **Recognition**: Opponent feels immovable or easily bases out with free leg

### Timing Considerations
When to attempt this transition:
- **Optimal Conditions**: When opponent's weight is on trapped leg or they're attempting to step forward
- **Avoid When**: Opponent has strong base with weight on free leg and low center of gravity
- **Setup Sequences**: After threatening leg locks or transitions that force weight onto trapped leg
- **Follow-up Windows**: Must secure top position within 2-3 seconds to prevent scramble or re-guard

### Prerequisites
Requirements before attempting:
- **Technical Skills**: Understanding of Single Leg X Guard control and leg entanglement basics
- **Physical Preparation**: Hip mobility for maintaining guard position and leg hook flexibility
- **Positional Understanding**: Single Leg X Guard mechanics and sweep principles
