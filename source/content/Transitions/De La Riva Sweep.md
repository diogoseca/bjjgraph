- **Speed Requirements**: Medium for quick reaction to opponent's posture or movement

## State Machine Content Elements

### Visual Execution Sequence
Detailed step-by-step description for clear movement sequence visualization:

From the De La Riva Guard position, you start on your back in an open guard configuration, with one leg hooked behind the opponent's lead leg at the knee, using your foot to control their thigh, while your other leg pushes on their far hip or knee to maintain distance and create angles, and you secure strong grips on their sleeve or collar to control their upper body. As the opponent attempts to pass or adjust their posture, you reinforce your grip on their sleeve or collar with both hands, pulling them forward to break their balance, while simultaneously shifting your hips to the side of their hooked leg to create an off-balancing angle. You deepen the De La Riva hook by pulling with your leg to further disrupt their base, using your pushing leg to extend and create additional leverage, while maintaining tension on their upper body to keep them leaning forward. With a sudden hip thrust and a pull on their upper body, you initiate the sweep by rolling them over their lead leg towards the direction of your hooked leg, using your momentum to follow through and come up on top as they land on their back or side. You establish a dominant position such as side control or top position, maintaining control of their legs or upper body to prevent immediate guard recovery, securing the sweep with chest pressure and positional awareness.

**Template**: "From De La Riva Guard, hook one leg behind opponent's lead leg at knee, push far hip with other leg, grip sleeve or collar. Pull forward with grips to break balance, shift hips to hooked leg side for angle. Deepen hook to disrupt base, extend pushing leg for leverage, keep upper body tension. Thrust hips and pull to roll opponent over lead leg, come up to top position. Secure side control or top position with control and pressure."

### Execution Steps (Numbered Sequence)
1. **Setup Requirements**: Start in De La Riva Guard with leg hooked behind opponent's lead leg
2. **Grip Control**: Secure strong grips on opponent's sleeve or collar with both hands
3. **Distance Management**: Use pushing leg on far hip or knee to maintain distance
4. **Angle Creation**: Shift hips to side of hooked leg to off-balance opponent
5. **Posture Break**: Pull forward with grips to disrupt opponent's balance
6. **Hook Deepening**: Pull with De La Riva hook to further unbalance opponent
7. **Leverage Extension**: Extend pushing leg to create additional sweeping leverage
8. **Sweep Initiation**: Thrust hips and pull upper body to roll opponent over lead leg
9. **Follow Through**: Come up on top to establish side control or top position

### Key Technical Details
Critical elements that determine success:
- **De La Riva Hook**: Strong leg control behind opponent's knee for base disruption
- **Grip Strength**: Secure hold on sleeve or collar to control upper body
- **Hip Mobility**: Dynamic hip shift to create sweeping angle and momentum
- **Leverage Management**: Pushing leg extension to maximize off-balancing force
- **Timing**: Coordinating grip pull, hook, and hip thrust for effective sweep

### Success Modifiers
Factors that increase/decrease probability:
- **Hook Effectiveness**: Strength of De La Riva hook on lead leg (+/-20%)
- **Grip Quality**: Control over opponent's upper body with sleeve or collar (+/-15%)
- **Hip Angle Creation**: Dynamic shift for optimal sweeping angle (+/-15%)
- **Opponent Posture**: Catching opponent during forward lean or pass attempt (+/-10%)
- **Knowledge Test Performance**: Understanding open guard sweep mechanics (+/-10%)

## Counter-Attack Analysis

### Common Counters
Opponent responses with success rates:
- **Posture Recovery**: Regaining upright posture to resist pull → [[Open Guard Top]] (Success Rate: 50%, Conditions: early recognition)
- **Leg Withdrawal**: Stepping back to free lead leg from hook → [[Neutral Position]] (Success Rate: 40%, Conditions: quick reaction)
- **Base Widening**: Adjusting stance to prevent roll → [[Top Position]] (Success Rate: 35%, Conditions: strong base)
- **Counter Sweep**: Using momentum for own sweep or pass → [[Bottom Position]] (Success Rate: 25%, Conditions: advanced skill)

Format: `[[Counter Technique]] → [[Result State]] (Success Rate: X%, Conditions: [when applicable])`

### Decision Logic
```
If [sweep setup] is recognized early:
- Execute [[Posture Recovery]] (Probability: 50%)

Else if [leg hook] can be broken quickly:
- Execute [[Leg Withdrawal]] (Probability: 40%)

Else if [base] is strong for resistance:
- Attempt [[Base Widening]] (Probability: 35%)

Else [skill level] allows for counterattack:
- Attempt [[Counter Sweep]] (Probability: 25%)

Else [optimal execution]:
- Accept transition (Probability: Success Rate - Modifiers)
```

## Educational Content

### Expert Insights
Commentary as if from recognized authorities:
- **John Danaher**: "The De La Riva Sweep is a cornerstone of modern open guard play, demonstrating the importance of leg entanglement to control and off-balance an opponent. The key lies in the dynamic hip movement and grip control, which must be synchronized to create a sweeping angle. This technique teaches critical principles of leverage and timing that are essential for advanced guard systems."
- **Gordon Ryan**: "In competition, the De La Riva Sweep is a high-percentage move against standing passers, especially when you catch them leaning forward. I focus on deepening the hook and pulling with power to ensure the roll, often transitioning to dominant positions. The technique shows how open guard can be a powerful offensive tool with proper execution."
- **Eddie Bravo**: "De La Riva Sweep brings a creative dynamic to open guard, allowing for fluid sweeps and transitions like the berimbolo if the initial roll fails. It integrates well with modern guard systems and can surprise opponents who aren't used to leg entanglements. This move is perfect for grapplers who want to develop a versatile, angle-based sweeping game."

Each insight should focus on one key technical or strategic element.

### Common Errors
For knowledge test generation:
- **Error**: Weak De La Riva hook or leg control
- **Why It Fails**: Fails to disrupt opponent's base, making sweep ineffective
- **Correction**: Ensure strong hook behind knee, pull with leg to off-balance
- **Recognition**: Opponent easily steps out or maintains upright posture

- **Error**: Poor grip control or posture break
- **Why It Fails**: Allows opponent to maintain balance and resist sweep
- **Correction**: Secure strong sleeve or collar grips, pull forward with force
- **Recognition**: Opponent's upper body remains stable during attempt

- **Error**: Inadequate hip mobility or angle creation
- **Why It Fails**: Lacks necessary leverage to roll opponent over lead leg
- **Correction**: Shift hips dynamically to hooked leg side for optimal angle
- **Recognition**: Sweep stalls or opponent counters with base adjustment

### Timing Considerations
When to attempt this transition:
- **Optimal Conditions**: When opponent stands or leans forward during pass attempt
- **Avoid When**: Opponent maintains low, defensive posture with strong base
- **Setup Sequences**: After establishing De La Riva Guard with grip control
- **Follow-up Windows**: Must complete sweep within 3-5 seconds to avoid counters

### Prerequisites
Requirements before attempting:
- **Technical Skills**: Understanding of open guard control and sweep mechanics
- **Physical Preparation**: Hip flexibility and strength for dynamic movement
- **Positional Understanding**: Control points in De La Riva Guard
- **Experience Level**: Intermediate to Advanced - requires precise timing and control

## Technical Assessment Elements
