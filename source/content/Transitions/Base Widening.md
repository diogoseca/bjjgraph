## State Machine Content Elements

### Visual Execution Sequence
From a top position in guard, you sense the bottom player attempting to off-balance you with grips or leg positioning. Immediately, you lower your center of gravity by bending your knees slightly while simultaneously widening your stance by moving your knees or feet laterally apart. Your weight distributes evenly across both legs as you maintain an upright posture with your spine aligned. The wider base creates a stable triangle of support that makes you significantly more difficult to sweep, neutralizing the bottom player's attacking leverage while you maintain top position control.

**One-Sentence Summary**: "From guard top position, you quickly widen your knee or foot placement while lowering your center of gravity, creating a stable base that prevents sweeps."

### Execution Steps (Numbered Sequence)
1. **Recognition**: Identify sweep threat or off-balancing attempt from bottom player
2. **Weight Distribution**: Lower your center of gravity by bending knees slightly
3. **Stance Expansion**: Widen stance by moving knees or feet further apart laterally
4. **Balance Check**: Ensure weight is centered and distributed evenly between both legs
5. **Posture Maintenance**: Keep spine aligned and head up while maintaining wide base
6. **Stabilization**: Hold stable position while neutralizing bottom player's sweep attempts

### Key Technical Details
Critical elements that determine success:
- **Grip Requirements**: Hand placement varies based on guard type but maintain connection
- **Base/Foundation**: Triangular stance with knees/feet wide creates stable platform
- **Timing Windows**: Execute immediately upon sensing off-balancing pressure
- **Leverage Points**: Low center of gravity combined with wide stance neutralizes sweeps
- **Common Adjustments**: Adjust width dynamically based on direction of sweep threat

### Success Modifiers
Factors that increase/decrease probability:
- **Setup Quality**: Early recognition of sweep threat (+/-5%)
- **Timing Precision**: Widening base before sweep initiates (+/-10%)
- **Opponent Fatigue**: Reduced sweep power when tired (+/-5%)
- **Knowledge Test Performance**: Understanding base mechanics (+/-15%)
- **Position Control**: Quality of top position grips and pressure (+/-10%)

## Counter-Attack Analysis

### Common Counters
Bottom player responses with success rates:
- **Guard Opening**: Attacking guard to force stance change → [[Open Guard]] (Success Rate: 35%, Conditions: when base is too wide to maintain closed guard)
- **Sweep Switch**: Changing sweep direction to attack new base angle → [[Sweep Attempt]] (Success Rate: 40%, Conditions: if top player overcommits to one side)
- **Submission Attack**: Threatening submission to force base change → [[Submission Setup]] (Success Rate: 30%, Conditions: when top player is static)
- **Guard Change**: Transitioning to different guard type → [[Guard Bottom]] (Success Rate: 45%, Conditions: when top player's base is too defensive)

Format: `[[Counter Technique]] → [[Result State]] (Success Rate: X%, Conditions: [when applicable])`

### Decision Logic
```
If [base width] is excessive and static:
- Execute [[Guard Opening]] (Probability: 35%)

Else if [top player] overcommits to defending one sweep direction:
- Execute [[Sweep Switch]] (Probability: 40%)

Else if [top player] has poor grips while widening base:
- Execute [[Submission Attack]] (Probability: 30%)

Else [optimal base width maintained]:
- Accept defensive position (Probability: Success Rate - Modifiers)
```

## Educational Content

### Expert Insights
Commentary from recognized authorities:
- **John Danaher**: "Base widening is the most fundamental defensive concept in guard passing. A wide base creates a geometrically stable structure that resists lateral forces effectively. The key is understanding that base width must be balanced - too narrow makes you vulnerable to sweeps, too wide makes you vulnerable to guard opening and submissions. The optimal width changes dynamically based on the specific guard type and sweep threats being presented."
- **Gordon Ryan**: "In competition, I use base widening constantly when passing guard. The moment I feel any sweep attempt, my base automatically widens to prevent it. However, I never let my base become so wide that I lose mobility or connection. The base needs to be wide enough to be stable but narrow enough to maintain offensive pressure and passing opportunities."
- **Eddie Bravo**: "Base widening is crucial in the 10th Planet system because many of our guards specifically attack the opponent's base. When passing lockdown, rubber guard, or electric chair positions, you have to widen your base immediately when you feel the sweep coming. The base width is what allows you to maintain control while dealing with these unorthodox guard positions."

### Common Errors
For knowledge test generation:
- **Error**: Widening base too late after sweep has already been initiated
- **Why It Fails**: Momentum of sweep is already established and difficult to stop
- **Correction**: Anticipate sweep threats and widen base proactively
- **Recognition**: Being swept despite attempting to widen base during the sweep

- **Error**: Making base so wide that mobility and guard connection are lost
- **Why It Fails**: Bottom player can open guard, attack submissions, or escape
- **Correction**: Widen base enough for stability but maintain tactical connection
- **Recognition**: Bottom player easily opens guard or escapes while you have wide base

- **Error**: Widening base without lowering center of gravity
- **Why It Fails**: High center of gravity still allows sweeps despite wider stance
- **Correction**: Combine base widening with knee bend to lower center of gravity
- **Recognition**: Still feeling unstable despite widened stance

- **Error**: Widening base uniformly without considering sweep direction
- **Why It Fails**: Wastes energy and may not address actual threat vector
- **Correction**: Widen base primarily in direction of sweep threat
- **Recognition**: Getting swept in unexpected direction while focusing on wrong side

- **Error**: Maintaining static wide base without adapting to guard changes
- **Why It Fails**: Different guards require different base widths and positions
- **Correction**: Adjust base width dynamically as bottom player changes guards
- **Recognition**: Being swept or submitted because base wasn't adapted to new guard

### Timing Considerations
When to attempt this transition:
- **Optimal Conditions**: Immediately upon feeling off-balancing pressure from bottom player
- **Avoid When**: Already committed to a guard pass and need to maintain momentum
- **Setup Sequences**: First defensive reaction to any sweep threat from guard
- **Follow-up Windows**: Must maintain wide base until sweep threat is neutralized

### Prerequisites
Requirements before attempting:
- **Technical Skills**: Basic understanding of top position in guard
- **Physical Preparation**: Leg strength for maintaining stable stance
- **Positional Understanding**: Recognition of sweep mechanics and base principles
- **Experience Level**: Beginner-friendly, one of first defensive concepts taught

## Technical Assessment Elements

### Knowledge Assessment Questions
5 technical questions with multiple choice answers:

1. **Mechanical Understanding**: "What creates stability when widening your base?"
   - A) Only the width of your stance
   - B) The combination of wide stance and low center of gravity
   - C) Gripping strength alone
   - D) Forward pressure on the opponent
   - **Answer**: B

2. **Timing Recognition**: "When is the optimal moment to widen your base?"
   - A) After the sweep has already started
   - B) Only when you feel yourself falling
   - C) Immediately upon sensing off-balancing pressure
   - D) When the bottom player asks you to
   - **Answer**: C

3. **Error Prevention**: "What is the most common mistake when widening base?"
   - A) Widening too late after sweep momentum is established
   - B) Widening too quickly
   - C) Using hands instead of legs
   - D) Looking at the ceiling
   - **Answer**: A

4. **Setup Requirements**: "Which element must accompany base widening for maximum effectiveness?"
   - A) Pulling the opponent closer
   - B) Lowering your center of gravity
   - C) Crossing your feet
   - D) Closing your eyes
   - **Answer**: B

5. **Adaptation**: "How should you adjust if base becomes too wide?"
   - A) Keep it wide indefinitely
   - B) Stand up completely
   - C) Narrow it slightly while maintaining connection and pressure
   - D) Switch to bottom position
   - **Answer**: C

### Variants and Adaptations
Different versions for various scenarios:
- **Gi Specific**: Use collar and sleeve grips to help distribute weight while widening base
- **No-Gi Specific**: Rely more on body positioning and underhooks for connection
- **Self-Defense**: Exaggerated base width may be needed against untrained opponents' wild movements
- **Competition**: Subtle base adjustments to avoid telegraphing defensive reactions
- **Size Differential**: Larger players can use wider base; smaller players need quicker, more dynamic adjustments

### Training Progressions
Skill development pathway:
- **Solo Practice**: Practice widening stance and lowering center of gravity without partner
- **Cooperative Drilling**: Partner applies light sweep pressure while you practice base widening
- **Resistant Practice**: Partner attempts actual sweeps while you defend with base widening
- **Sparring Integration**: Implement base widening reflexively during live rolling
- **Troubleshooting**: Identify situations where base widening alone isn't sufficient

### Common Troubleshooting Patterns

```yaml
troubleshooting:
  - symptom: "Still getting swept despite widening base"
    likely_cause: "Timing too late or center of gravity too high"
    diagnostic_questions:
      - "Are you widening before or after sweep initiates?"
      - "Are you also lowering your hips when widening?"
      - "Is your weight evenly distributed on both legs?"
    solution: "React faster to sweep threats, combine base width with lowered center of gravity, maintain even weight distribution"

  - symptom: "Base feels too wide and immobile"
    likely_cause: "Excessive base width without tactical purpose"
    diagnostic_questions:
      - "Can you still move and pass guard effectively?"
      - "Has the guard opened because your base is too wide?"
      - "Are you able to maintain pressure on opponent?"
    solution: "Narrow base slightly to regain mobility while maintaining stability, adjust width dynamically based on threats"

  - symptom: "Bottom player keeps opening guard when base widens"
    likely_cause: "Base width incompatible with maintaining closed guard"
    diagnostic_questions:
      - "Are you in closed guard or open guard?"
      - "Is your base so wide that closed guard cannot be maintained?"
      - "Are you controlling the guard opening process?"
    solution: "Accept guard opening as tactical trade-off, transition to open guard passing strategies, control the opening timing"
```

## Competition Applications
- **IBJJF Rules**: Essential defensive technique at all belt levels, prevents negative score from being swept
- **No-Gi Competition**: Critical for defending against leg entanglement sweeps and guards
- **Self-Defense**: Wide stable base prevents takedowns and sweeps in street situations
- **MMA Applications**: Base widening essential in MMA guard to defend against sweeps and create striking opportunities

## Historical Context
Base widening is a fundamental concept that predates organized Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu, rooted in basic wrestling and grappling principles. The wide base creates a stable structure resistant to lateral forces, a concept that appears across all grappling arts. In BJJ, as guard systems evolved and became more sophisticated, base widening became an increasingly important defensive skill.

## Safety Considerations
- **Controlled Application**: Avoid excessive or sudden base widening that could strain groin or hip muscles
- **Mat Awareness**: Ensure adequate space when widening stance to avoid partner collisions
- **Partner Safety**: Don't drive knees into partner's body when widening base
- **Gradual Progression**: Build up flexibility and strength for wider bases over time

## Position Integration
**Common base widening applications:**
- [[Closed Guard Top]] → [[Base Widening]] → [[Guard Top Stable]]
- [[Open Guard Top]] → [[Base Widening]] → [[Guard Passing Position]]
- [[Half Guard Top]] → [[Base Widening]] → [[Half Guard Pass Position]]

## Notes for Developers

This transition represents a fundamental defensive concept rather than a traditional offensive technique. Base widening is a reactive adjustment that prevents sweeps and maintains top position. It's essential for the game engine to recognize this as a high-priority defensive response when sweep threats are detected.

The success rate is intentionally high because base widening is a simple, reliable defensive concept that works well when properly timed. The main failure modes are timing-related (too late) or execution-related (too wide, not combining with center of gravity adjustment).
