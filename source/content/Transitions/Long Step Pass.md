# Long Step Pass
#bjj #transition #pass #guard

## Visual Execution Sequence

From open guard top, you establish grips on opponent's pants at the knees or ankles. You drive one knee forward past their leg while posting your opposite hand on the mat for base, creating a long diagonal step that clears their guard. Your body weight shifts over their hips as you drag their legs to one side, then you bring your stepping leg all the way across their body. The pressure combined with leg control prevents them from recovering guard as you settle into side control with full chest pressure and control.

**One-Sentence Summary**: "From open guard with leg grips, you step one knee far across their body while dragging their legs away, transitioning to side control top."

## Execution Steps

1. **Setup Requirements**: Establish grips on both pants near knees or ankles, posture up with good base, control distance
2. **Initial Movement**: Drive one knee forward and across, past opponent's near leg, while keeping far hand posted for base
3. **Opponent Response**: They typically try to recover guard with legs, push your knee away, or attempt to frame
4. **Adaptation**: Keep forward pressure on your stepping knee, drag their legs to opposite side with grips, pin legs to mat
5. **Completion**: Complete the step by bringing your trailing leg over, establish chest pressure, secure side control grips
6. **Consolidation**: Cross face, underhook, apply full side control pressure to prevent escape attempts

## Key Technical Details

- **Grip Requirements**: Pants grips at knees or ankles with both hands, or one leg controlled with hand/elbow while other is pinned
- **Base/Foundation**: Opposite hand posts on mat for stability during step, hips stay low, weight forward over opponent
- **Timing Windows**: Execute when opponent's legs are extended or when creating distance, step is explosive but controlled
- **Leverage Points**: Stepping knee pressure pins their hips down while grips control leg direction
- **Common Adjustments**: If knee is pushed back, switch to knee slice or adjust angle; if legs escape, transition to different pass

## Common Counters

Opponent defensive responses with success rates and conditions:

- **[[Push Knee and Re-Guard]]** → [[Open Guard Bottom]] (Success Rate: 40%, Conditions: early recognition before weight commits)
- **[[Hip Escape and Frame]]** → [[Guard Recovery]] (Success Rate: 35%, Conditions: creates space before step completes)
- **[[Leg Retention Hooks]]** → [[Half Guard]] (Success Rate: 45%, Conditions: catches passing leg with hook or lockdown)
- **[[Scramble to Turtle]]** → [[Turtle Position]] (Success Rate: 30%, Conditions: gives up position to avoid getting passed)

### Decision Logic for AI Opponent

```
If [step not committed] AND [knee accessible]:
- Execute [[Push Knee and Re-Guard]] (Probability: 40%)

Else if [step committed] but [space exists]:
- Execute [[Hip Escape and Frame]] (Probability: 35%)

Else if [passing leg available]:
- Execute [[Leg Retention Hooks]] (Probability: 45%)

Else [pass completing]:
- Accept transition or [[Scramble to Turtle]] (Probability: 30%)
```

## Expert Insights

### John Danaher
"The long step pass is fundamentally about creating angles that opponent's guard recovery mechanisms cannot address. The key is the diagonal pressure vector - by stepping far across their body while controlling their legs to the opposite side, you create geometric problems they cannot solve with standard guard retention. The pass succeeds not through speed or strength, but through positional geometry that eliminates their defensive options."

### Gordon Ryan
"In competition, long step is my go-to when opponents play distance-based guards. The key is committing fully to the step - half measures get you stuck in terrible positions. I grip the pants tight, drive my knee across like I'm stepping over a log, and drag their legs away hard. If they defend the step, I'm already in position to switch to knee slice or leg drag. The pass chains naturally with other passes, making it high percentage against modern guard players."

### Eddie Bravo
"Long step is classic pressure passing. In no-gi you have to modify the grips - grab behind the knees or control the feet directly. The concept is the same though: make a long diagonal step that clears their leg structure while pinning their hips. I teach it as part of the passing system where every pass connects to the next. If long step gets blocked, you're already set up for multiple other passes."

## Common Errors

### Error 1: Stepping Too Narrow
- **Why It Fails**: Short step doesn't clear their leg structure, allows easy guard recovery
- **Correction**: Step your knee far across their body, past their far hip, creating wide angle
- **Recognition**: If they easily recover guard with legs, your step wasn't long enough

### Error 2: Releasing Leg Control Too Early
- **Why It Fails**: Without leg control, opponent immediately puts legs back in guard position
- **Correction**: Maintain grips until chest pressure is fully established and you're secure in side control
- **Recognition**: They recover guard as you pass - you let go of legs too soon

### Error 3: Poor Base During Step
- **Why It Fails**: Without posted hand, opponent can roll you over or sweep during the step
- **Correction**: Post opposite hand firmly on mat, create tripod base with hand and two legs
- **Recognition**: Feeling unstable or getting swept during step execution

## Timing Considerations

- **Optimal Conditions**: When opponent extends legs creating space, when their feet are on your hips or biceps, after breaking grips
- **Avoid When**: Opponent has deep sleeve/collar control, when your base is compromised, when they have triangles or submissions threatened
- **Setup Sequences**: After standing up in guard, after breaking guard grips, after feinting other passes to create reactions
- **Follow-up Windows**: Must establish side control within 2-3 seconds after completing step to prevent guard recovery

## Prerequisites

- **Technical Skills**: Open guard passing fundamentals, side control establishment, base maintenance while passing
- **Physical Preparation**: Hip mobility for long step, core strength for weight distribution, coordination for simultaneous grip/step
- **Positional Understanding**: Open guard structure, guard retention concepts, passing angles and pressure
- **Experience Level**: Intermediate - requires good timing and coordination

## Knowledge Assessment

1. **Mechanical Understanding**: "What creates the passing mechanism in the long step pass?"
   - A) Pure speed across the guard
   - B) Stepping wide while controlling legs to opposite side creating geometric advantage
   - C) Strength to push through legs
   - D) Opponent making mistakes
   - **Answer**: B

2. **Timing Recognition**: "When is the optimal moment to execute the long step?"
   - A) When opponent has deep grips on you
   - B) When you have no base
   - C) When opponent's legs are extended or creating distance
   - D) When you're tired
   - **Answer**: C

3. **Error Prevention**: "What is the most common mistake that causes this pass to fail?"
   - A) Stepping too far
   - B) Stepping too narrow/short, not clearing leg structure
   - C) Maintaining grips too long
   - D) Having too much base
   - **Answer**: B

4. **Setup Requirements**: "What must be controlled before attempting this pass?"
   - A) Only one leg
   - B) Opponent's upper body
   - C) Both legs with grips at knees or ankles, with good base
   - D) Nothing specific
   - **Answer**: C

5. **Adaptation**: "How should you adjust if opponent pushes your stepping knee away?"
   - A) Force the same pass harder
   - B) Give up and stand up
   - C) Switch to knee slice, leg drag, or different pass angle
   - D) Pull guard
   - **Answer**: C

## Variants and Adaptations

- **Gi Specific**: Grip pants at knees or ankles, more friction and control, can use lapel for additional control
- **No-Gi Specific**: Control behind knees or ankles directly, need more speed as less friction, emphasize weight pressure more
- **Self-Defense**: Modified for clothing grips, focus on quick establishment of control, awareness of strikes
- **Competition**: Chain with other passes (knee slice, leg drag), use to score pass points, time management tool
- **Size Differential**: Smaller grapplers can use speed and angles more; larger grapplers can use pressure and weight

## Training Progressions

1. **Solo Practice**: Practice long step movement without partner, work on coordination and balance
2. **Cooperative Drilling**: Partner holds open guard with legs extended, allows pass with minimal resistance
3. **Resistant Practice**: Partner defends with guard retention but at 50-75% intensity
4. **Sparring Integration**: Use during live rolling, recognize timing windows, chain with other passes
5. **Troubleshooting**: Identify why pass fails in live situations, drill specific problems, refine timing

## Position Integration

**Common combinations and sequences:**
- [[Open Guard Top]] → [[Long Step Pass]] → [[Side Control Top]]
- [[Open Guard Top]] → [[Long Step Pass]] → [[Knee Slice Pass]] (if defended)
- [[Open Guard Top]] → [[Long Step Pass]] → [[Leg Drag Pass]] (if angle changes)
