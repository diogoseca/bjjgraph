## Transition Description
The Butterfly Sweep is a fundamental sweeping technique executed from the Butterfly Guard that uses the practitioner's butterfly hook(s) and upper body control to efficiently overturn an opponent from top position to bottom position. Unlike many other sweeps that rely on complex gripping or timing, the Butterfly Sweep leverages simple mechanical principles of elevating the opponent's base with the legs while simultaneously pulling their upper body forward and to the side, creating a powerful combination that compromises balance. This technique represents one of the most efficient and high-percentage sweeps in BJJ, functioning effectively across all levels of competition and in both gi and no-gi contexts. The Butterfly Sweep's enduring relevance in the BJJ meta-game stems from its mechanical simplicity, its adaptability across contexts, and the powerful foundation it creates for both sweep and submission chains.

## Visual Execution Sequence
Detailed description for clear visualization of the transition in action:

From a seated Butterfly Guard, you sit with your feet hooked under the opponent's thighs, close to their hips, while they are on their knees or in a combat base, attempting to maintain posture or initiate a guard pass. You establish upper body control by securing an underhook on one side, pulling their torso close to disrupt their balance, while your other hand may control their wrist or collar to prevent posting. Shifting your body slightly off-center towards the underhook side, you create an angle that maximizes leverage for the sweep. With a coordinated effort, you pull their upper body forward and to the side with your underhook while simultaneously elevating their hips using your butterfly hooks, driving through your legs to lift their weight off the mat. As their balance breaks and they begin to topple, you guide their momentum in the sweeping direction, rolling them over your shoulder or hip to the mat. Finally, you follow their movement, maintaining control to land in a dominant top position such as Side Control or Mount, ready to consolidate your advantage.

**Template**: "From seated Butterfly Guard, hooks under opponent's thighs, they kneel or combat base. Secure underhook on one side, control wrist or collar with other hand. Shift body off-center to underhook side for angle. Pull upper body forward and side with underhook, elevate hips with hooks. Guide momentum to roll opponent over shoulder or hip. Follow to land in Side Control or Mount."

## Execution Steps
1. Establish proper Butterfly Guard with hook(s) positioned under opponent's thigh(s), close to their hips for maximum leverage.
2. Secure appropriate upper body control, typically an underhook on one side, to pull opponent close and disrupt posture.
3. Create an appropriate angle relative to opponent by shifting your body off-center, typically towards the control side.
4. Coordinate upper body pull with powerful butterfly hook elevation, using your legs to lift opponent's weight.
5. Lift opponent's hips with leg drive while compromising their upper body posture with your pull, breaking their balance.
6. Guide opponent's momentum in the sweeping direction, typically to the side of upper body control, rolling them over.
7. Follow opponent's movement to maintain control during positional transition, ensuring a smooth reversal.
8. Establish dominant top position as sweep completes, such as Side Control or Mount, to consolidate advantage.

## Key Details
- **Hook Placement**: Foot positioned directly under opponent's thigh, close to hip for optimal lift.
- **Upper Body Control**: Various options including underhook, overhook, collar tie, sleeve grip to disrupt posture.
- **Angle Creation**: Typically off-center toward control side rather than directly in front for better leverage.
- **Hip Position**: Close to opponent with minimal space to maximize hook leverage and elevation power.
- **Timing Element**: Coordinated upper and lower body movement for maximum efficiency in breaking balance.
- **Weight Commitment**: Opponent must have weight committed forward for optimal effectiveness of the sweep.
- **Body Alignment**: Practitioner's body typically aligned at angle to opponent to facilitate directional pull.
- **Follow-through**: Continuous control through positional transition to secure top position.

## Success Modifiers
Factors that influence the success rate of the transition:
- **Hook Depth**: Deep positioning under opponent's thighs for maximum lift (+15%)
- **Upper Body Control**: Strong underhook or grip to disrupt posture (+10%)
- **Angle Precision**: Correct off-center positioning for leverage (+10%)
- **Timing**: Execution when opponent's weight is forward (+10%)
- **Experience Level**: Familiarity with sweep mechanics (+5% per skill level)

## Common Counters and Counter-Attacks
Analysis of opponent responses with success rates for counter-attacks:
- [[Base Widening]] → [[Stability Enhancement]] (Success Rate: 50%, Conditions: opponent widens knees before elevation)
- [[Head Position Control]] → [[Posture Maintenance]] (Success Rate: 55%, Conditions: opponent keeps head up to resist pull)
- [[Sprawl]] → [[Pressure Application]] (Success Rate: 45%, Conditions: opponent sprawls hips back to counter lift)
- [[Counter Underhook]] → [[Upper Body Control]] (Success Rate: 40%, Conditions: opponent fights for underhook to block pull)
- [[Hook Defense]] → [[Leg Positioning]] (Success Rate: 60%, Conditions: opponent steps over hooks to prevent lift)
- [[Submission Counter]] → [[Armbar Opportunity]] (Success Rate: 35%, Conditions: opponent capitalizes on exposed arm during sweep)

## Decision Logic for Opponent Behavior
```
If [opponent weight] is committed forward:
- Execute [[Butterfly Sweep]] (Probability: 80%)

Else if [opponent base] is wide and stable:
- Attempt [[Arm Drag]] first to disrupt posture (Probability: 50%)

Else if [opponent head] is postured up strongly:
- Transition to [[Collar Tie Control]] (Probability: 55%)

Else if [opponent pass] attempt begins:
- Adjust to [[Double Butterfly Sweep]] (Probability: 60%)

Else [maintain control]:
- Reinforce hooks and wait for weight shift (Probability: 45%)
```

## Variants
- Traditional Butterfly Sweep (underhook control to same side for standard reversal)
- Double Butterfly Sweep (using both hooks simultaneously for powerful lift)
- Cross Butterfly Sweep (sweeping to opposite side of control for surprise)
- Gi-specific Butterfly Sweep (using collar/sleeve grips for added control)
- No-Gi Butterfly Sweep (using neck tie or underhook control for grip)
- Single Butterfly Sweep (using only one hook for specific scenarios)
- Arm Drag Butterfly Sweep (combining arm drag motion to isolate arm)
- Modified Butterfly Sweep (various grip configurations for adaptability)

## Expert Insights
- **John Danaher**: "The Butterfly Sweep is a primary offensive option from the seated guard position, focusing on precise mechanical details of hook positioning and upper body control that maximize leverage while minimizing effort. It’s critical to understand the relationship between weight distribution and sweep direction, viewing the technique as a physics problem of manipulating an opponent's center of gravity. This sweep is a cornerstone of efficient guard play."
- **Gordon Ryan**: "I approach the Butterfly Sweep as a primary weapon within my bottom game, particularly in no-gi contexts. It’s about creating situations where opponents are forced to commit weight forward, making them vulnerable to the sweep. I place particular focus on the follow-through phase, ensuring that the positional advantage gained is maximized through proper top position establishment."
- **Eddie Bravo**: "I've incorporated the Butterfly Sweep within my 10th Planet system with a focus on no-gi variations and transitions to leg entanglements. When teaching the technique, I emphasize the importance of creating the proper angle before sweep initiation and the possibility of transitioning to leg attacks if the opponent defends in specific ways. It’s a versatile tool for dynamic guard play."

## Historical Context
The Butterfly Sweep represents one of the oldest and most universal sweeping techniques in grappling, with variations appearing across numerous traditional martial arts including judo (where it's known as "sumi gaeshi"). In Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu, the technique gained particular prominence through the influence of wrestlers transitioning to BJJ, who adapted their sitting techniques to the guard context. The Butterfly Guard and its associated sweeps experienced a renaissance in the 2000s through the influence of guard players like Marcelo Garcia, who demonstrated the high effectiveness of butterfly techniques at the highest levels of competition. The technique continues to evolve with modern adaptations focusing on transitions to leg entanglements and more sophisticated setup variations.

## Conceptual Framework
The Butterfly Sweep exemplifies core BJJ principles of leverage, timing, and efficiency. The technique demonstrates the power of proper mechanical advantage, where a smaller practitioner can effectively sweep a larger opponent by correctly applying leverage principles. This represents the essence of technical jiu-jitsu: using precise positioning and coordination to overcome physical disadvantages. The sweep's universal effectiveness speaks to its foundation in fundamental physical principles rather than athletic attributes.

## Computer Science Analogy
The Butterfly Sweep functions as an "atomic transaction" in the BJJ state machine, where multiple inputs (hook position, upper body control, angle, timing, hip drive) must be correctly configured to execute a state transition that flips the positional hierarchy. This creates a form of "transactional integrity" where all components must be properly executed for the operation to succeed. The technique exemplifies the concept of "compound operations" where multiple simple mechanisms (elevation, pulling, angle creation) combine to create an emergent effect greater than any individual component, similar to how complex software functions emerge from combinations of simpler operations.
