## Transition Description
The Butterfly Sweep is a fundamental sweeping technique executed from the Butterfly Guard that uses the practitioner's butterfly hook(s) and upper body control to efficiently overturn an opponent from top position to bottom position. Unlike many other sweeps that rely on complex gripping or timing, the Butterfly Sweep leverages simple mechanical principles of elevating the opponent's base with the legs while simultaneously pulling their upper body forward and to the side, creating a powerful combination that compromises balance. This technique represents one of the most efficient and high-percentage sweeps in BJJ, functioning effectively across all levels of competition and in both gi and no-gi contexts. The Butterfly Sweep's enduring relevance in the BJJ meta-game stems from its mechanical simplicity, its adaptability across contexts, and the powerful foundation it creates for both sweep and submission chains.

## Execution Steps
1. Establish proper butterfly guard with hook(s) positioned under opponent's thigh(s)
2. Secure appropriate upper body control (typically underhook, overhook, or collar tie)
3. Create appropriate angle relative to opponent (typically off-center)
4. Coordinate upper body pull with powerful butterfly hook elevation
5. Lift opponent's weight with leg drive while compromising their upper body posture
6. Guide opponent's momentum in sweeping direction (typically to the side of upper body control)
7. Follow opponent's movement to maintain control during positional transition
8. Establish dominant top position as sweep completes

## Key Details
- **Hook Placement**: Foot positioned directly under opponent's thigh, close to hip
- **Upper Body Control**: Various options including underhook, overhook, collar tie, sleeve grip
- **Angle Creation**: Typically off-center toward control side rather than directly in front
- **Hip Position**: Close to opponent with minimal space to maximize hook leverage
- **Timing Element**: Coordinated upper and lower body movement for maximum efficiency
- **Weight Commitment**: Opponent must have weight committed forward for optimal effectiveness
- **Body Alignment**: Practitioner's body typically aligned at angle to opponent
- **Follow-through**: Continuous control through positional transition

## Common Counters
- [[Base Widening]] → [[Stability Enhancement]]
- [[Head Position Control]] → [[Posture Maintenance]]
- [[Sprawl]] → [[Pressure Application]]
- [[Counter Underhook]] → [[Upper Body Control]]
- [[Hook Defense]] → [[Leg Positioning]]

## Variants
- Traditional Butterfly Sweep (underhook control to same side)
- Double Butterfly Sweep (using both hooks simultaneously)
- Cross Butterfly Sweep (sweeping to opposite side of control)
- Gi-specific Butterfly Sweep (using collar/sleeve grips)
- No-Gi Butterfly Sweep (using neck tie or underhook control)
- Single Butterfly Sweep (using only one hook)
- Arm Drag Butterfly Sweep (combining arm drag motion)
- Modified Butterfly Sweep (various grip configurations)

## Expert Insights
- **Danaher System**: Emphasizes the Butterfly Sweep as a primary offensive option from the seated guard position, focusing on precise mechanical details of hook positioning and upper body control that maximize leverage while minimizing effort. Particularly emphasizes understanding the relationship between weight distribution and sweep direction, viewing the technique as a physics problem of manipulating an opponent's center of gravity.
- **Gordon Ryan**: Approaches the Butterfly Sweep as a primary weapon within his bottom game, particularly in no-gi contexts. Emphasizes creating situations where opponents are forced to commit weight forward, making them vulnerable to the sweep. Places particular focus on the follow-through phase, ensuring that the positional advantage gained is maximized through proper top position establishment.
- **Eddie Bravo**: Has incorporated the Butterfly Sweep within his 10th Planet system with particular focus on no-gi variations and transitions to leg entanglements. When teaching the technique, emphasizes the importance of creating the proper angle before sweep initiation and the possibility of transitioning to leg attacks if the opponent defends in specific ways.

## Timing Considerations
- Execute when opponent's weight is committed forward
- Time with opponent's pressure or forward movement
- Perform after establishing dominant upper body control
- Implement when opponent's base is narrowed or compromised
- Use as counter to specific passing attempts
- Capitalize on opponent's grip fighting or hand positioning

## Setup Connections
- [[Seated Guard]] → [[Butterfly Guard]] → [[Butterfly Sweep]]
- [[Arm Drag]] → [[Underhook Control]] → [[Butterfly Sweep]]
- [[Collar Tie]] → [[Head Control]] → [[Butterfly Sweep]]
- [[Guard Retention]] → [[Butterfly Hook Insertion]] → [[Butterfly Sweep]]
- [[Overhook Control]] → [[Butterfly Sweep]]
- [[Defensive Framing]] → [[Butterfly Guard Recovery]] → [[Butterfly Sweep]]

## Follow-up Options
- [[Side Control Establishment]] → [[Side Control]]
- [[Mount Attainment]] → [[Mount]]
- [[Knee on Belly]] → [[Knee on Belly Position]]
- [[Transition to Back]] → [[Back Control]]
- [[Near Side Armbar]] → [[Armbar Control]]
- [[Kimura Trap]] → [[Kimura Control]]

## Common Errors
- Insufficient hook depth → Inadequate lifting power
- Poor upper body control → Lack of directional control
- Improper angle → Decreased mechanical advantage
- Attempting against stable base → Reduced effectiveness
- Weak hip drive → Limited elevation of opponent
- Neglecting follow-through → Compromised transition to top position

## Performance Tips
- Focus on establishing deep hook positioning before initiating sweep
- Create and maintain proper angle throughout execution
- Develop powerful hip drive through targeted training
- Practice seamless coordination between upper and lower body
- Maintain continuous control through transitional phase
- Develop awareness of common defensive responses

## Training Approaches
- Isolated technical drilling with cooperative partner
- Progressive resistance training with increasing defensive pressure
- Flow drilling connecting butterfly sweep to related techniques
- Situational sparring starting from butterfly guard
- Defensive recognition and response training
- Transition practice to dominant top positions

## Historical Context
The Butterfly Sweep represents one of the oldest and most universal sweeping techniques in grappling, with variations appearing across numerous traditional martial arts including judo (where it's known as "sumi gaeshi"). In Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu, the technique gained particular prominence through the influence of wrestlers transitioning to BJJ, who adapted their sitting techniques to the guard context. The butterfly guard and its associated sweeps experienced a renaissance in the 2000s through the influence of guard players like Marcelo Garcia, who demonstrated the high effectiveness of butterfly techniques at the highest levels of competition. The technique continues to evolve with modern adaptations focusing on transitions to leg entanglements and more sophisticated setup variations.

## Competition Effectiveness
The Butterfly Sweep has proven consistently effective across competition contexts:
- Gi competition: Functions with both traditional and cloth-specific grips
- No-gi competition: Remains highly effective with adapted gripping
- MMA application: Provides effective sweeping option with striking awareness
- Self-defense relevance: Creates powerful positional change with minimal risk
- Lower belt competition: High percentage technique with straightforward mechanics
- Elite competition: Continues to prove effective at highest levels

## Conceptual Framework
The Butterfly Sweep exemplifies core BJJ principles of leverage, timing, and efficiency. The technique demonstrates the power of proper mechanical advantage, where a smaller practitioner can effectively sweep a larger opponent by correctly applying leverage principles. This represents the essence of technical jiu-jitsu: using precise positioning and coordination to overcome physical disadvantages. The sweep's universal effectiveness speaks to its foundation in fundamental physical principles rather than athletic attributes.

## Computer Science Analogy
The Butterfly Sweep functions as an "atomic transaction" in the BJJ state machine, where multiple inputs (hook position, upper body control, angle, timing, hip drive) must be correctly configured to execute a state transition that flips the positional hierarchy. This creates a form of "transactional integrity" where all components must be properly executed for the operation to succeed. The technique exemplifies the concept of "compound operations" where multiple simple mechanisms (elevation, pulling, angle creation) combine to create an emergent effect greater than any individual component, similar to how complex software functions emerge from combinations of simpler operations.
