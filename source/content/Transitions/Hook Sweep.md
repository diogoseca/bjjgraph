# Hook Sweep
#bjj #transition #sweep #butterfly_guard #fundamental

## Visual Execution Sequence

From butterfly guard, you establish underhooks or arm control while maintaining your butterfly hooks under your opponent's thighs. As they attempt to pass or establish their own grips, you pull them forward slightly to compromise their base while simultaneously lifting with your hooks. You then rotate your body toward the sweeping direction while extending your leg hook powerfully upward and forward. The combination of pulling, lifting, and rotating creates an irresistible off-balancing force that elevates and sweeps them to the side, allowing you to follow through into side control top position.

**One-Sentence Summary**: "From butterfly guard with underhooks and hooks in place, you pull forward while lifting with your hook and rotating your body, sweeping them to side control."

## Execution Steps

1. **Setup Requirements**: Establish butterfly guard with hooks under opponent's thighs, secure underhooks or collar grips for control
2. **Initial Movement**: Pull opponent slightly forward to compromise their base and bring weight onto your hooks
3. **Opponent Response**: Opponent typically attempts to maintain base by widening stance or posting hands
4. **Adaptation**: Adjust sweeping direction based on where opponent's weight is distributed and which side offers least resistance
5. **Completion**: Lift powerfully with your hook while pulling with upper body and rotating toward sweep direction
6. **Consolidation**: Follow through by coming up on top and establishing side control position with crossface and hip pressure

## Key Technical Details

- **Grip Requirements**: Strong underhooks or collar grips to pull opponent forward and control upper body, prevent them from posturing away
- **Base/Foundation**: Sit on your tailbone with hooks actively engaged under opponent's thighs, maintaining forward lean engagement
- **Timing Windows**: Execute when opponent's weight is slightly forward or when they attempt to pass, capitalizing on their momentum
- **Leverage Points**: Hook creates elevator effect lifting opponent's leg while pull brings their weight over the tipping point
- **Common Adjustments**: Vary hook depth and pulling angle based on opponent's defensive posture and weight distribution

## Common Counters

Opponent defensive responses with success rates and conditions:

- **[[Sprawl Defense]]** → [[Top Position]] (Success Rate: 50%, Conditions: early recognition with immediate weight shift backward)
- **[[Whizzer Control]]** → [[Pass Defense]] (Success Rate: 45%, Conditions: catching underhook and controlling arm to prevent pull)
- **[[Base Widening]]** → [[Butterfly Guard Top]] (Success Rate: 40%, Conditions: widening base before sweep initiates to improve stability)
- **[[Limp Leg Counter]]** → [[Guard Pass]] (Success Rate: 35%, Conditions: removing weight from hooked leg to neutralize lift)

### Decision Logic for AI Opponent

```
If [setup quality] < 50%:
- Execute [[Base Widening]] (Probability: 40%)

Else if [underhooks] are shallow or controlled:
- Execute [[Whizzer Control]] (Probability: 45%)

Else if [timing] telegraphed early:
- Execute [[Sprawl Defense]] (Probability: 50%)

Else [optimal execution conditions]:
- Accept transition (Probability: Base Success Rate - Applied Modifiers)
```

## Expert Insights

### John Danaher
"The hook sweep is fundamentally about creating elevation through mechanical advantage. The butterfly hook functions as a lever - the longer the lever arm and the more effectively you can lift, the easier the sweep becomes. The key is understanding that the sweep requires coordination of three forces: the upward lift from the hook, the forward pull from the upper body grip, and the rotational momentum of your torso. When these three forces converge at the right moment, the sweep becomes nearly unstoppable."

### Gordon Ryan
"In competition, I use the hook sweep as a primary attacking weapon from butterfly guard. The technique is particularly effective when you can force the opponent to engage with you rather than maintain distance. I often set it up by threatening other attacks like the arm drag or guillotine, which brings them forward into the perfect position for the sweep. The immediate transition to side control gives you dominant position and scoring opportunities, making it extremely high-percentage in points-based competition."

### Eddie Bravo
"The hook sweep integrates beautifully with the 10th Planet system's emphasis on dynamic guard play. From butterfly, you can chain this sweep with various other attacks - if they defend the hook sweep by posturing back, you can transition to X-guard or single leg X. If they try to pass around your hooks, you can switch to the arm drag to back take. The sweep itself is simple but becomes much more dangerous when it's part of a larger offensive system rather than an isolated technique."

## Common Errors

### Error 1: Attempting sweep without establishing proper grips first
- **Why It Fails**: Without control of opponent's upper body, they can easily posture away and neutralize your hooks
- **Correction**: Always secure underhooks, collar grips, or sleeve control before initiating sweep motion
- **Recognition**: Opponent maintains upright posture and easily prevents sweep by leaning back

### Error 2: Lifting with hooks before pulling opponent forward
- **Why It Fails**: If opponent's weight is back on their heels, lifting alone cannot generate enough force to sweep them
- **Correction**: Pull opponent forward first to bring their weight over your hooks, then lift
- **Recognition**: Hook lift feels weak and opponent doesn't elevate despite maximum effort

### Error 3: Not rotating body during sweep execution
- **Why It Fails**: Without rotational momentum, you lose power and direction, making sweep incomplete
- **Correction**: As you lift with hooks and pull with arms, rotate your entire torso toward the sweeping direction
- **Recognition**: Sweep stalls halfway through or opponent recovers balance before you can follow through

### Error 4: Hooks positioned too shallow under opponent's thighs
- **Why It Fails**: Shallow hooks don't provide sufficient leverage for lifting and are easily cleared
- **Correction**: Insert hooks deep under opponent's thighs, close to their center of mass
- **Recognition**: Opponent easily removes your hooks or steps over them during sweep attempt

### Error 5: Failing to follow through to top position immediately
- **Why It Fails**: Delay allows opponent to recover guard or scramble to better position
- **Correction**: Maintain grip contact and pressure as you come up, immediately establishing side control
- **Recognition**: Successfully sweeping opponent but ending in scramble rather than dominant position

## Timing Considerations

- **Optimal Conditions**: When opponent leans forward to establish grips or pass, when their weight is on your hooks, after threatening other attacks that bring them forward
- **Avoid When**: Opponent is postured back with weight on heels, when they have strong whizzer control, when your hooks are shallow or compromised
- **Setup Sequences**: After threatening [[Arm Drag]], after failed [[Guillotine Setup]], when opponent defends [[X-Guard Entry]]
- **Follow-up Windows**: Must complete sweep and establish side control within 2-3 seconds to prevent opponent recovery

## Prerequisites

- **Technical Skills**: Basic [[Butterfly Guard]] maintenance, understanding of underhook control, grip fighting fundamentals
- **Physical Preparation**: Core strength for maintaining seated posture, leg strength for powerful hook lift, hip flexibility for hook placement
- **Positional Understanding**: Butterfly guard mechanics, sweep principles, transition from guard to top position
- **Experience Level**: Beginner to Intermediate - fundamental sweep but requires coordination of multiple elements

   - **Answer**: B

## Variants and Adaptations

- **Gi Specific**: Can utilize collar grips and sleeve control for additional pulling power and directional control
- **No-Gi Specific**: Emphasis on underhooks and overhooks for upper body control, may use head control as alternative
- **Self-Defense**: Modified version can work from seated position on ground in street altercation
- **Competition**: Chain with other butterfly guard attacks for multiple threat system, highly effective for scoring sweeps
- **Size Differential**: Smaller practitioners benefit from technical leverage advantage over larger opponents when properly executed

## Training Progressions

1. **Solo Practice**: Practice hook placement, sit-up motion, and rotation mechanics without partner to develop motor patterns
2. **Cooperative Drilling**: Partner allows sweep completion while you focus on coordination of lifting, pulling, and rotating
3. **Resistant Practice**: Partner provides progressive resistance to test timing and force application under pressure
4. **Sparring Integration**: Implement sweep during live rolling, recognizing opportunities when opponent engages or passes
5. **Troubleshooting**: Identify why sweep fails in live situations - usually grip problems, timing issues, or incomplete rotation

## Competition Applications

- **IBJJF Rules**: Legal at all belt levels, scores as sweep (2 points) plus side control (additional advantage), immediate scoring opportunity
- **No-Gi Competition**: Highly effective with proper underhook control, commonly used in submission-only formats
- **Self-Defense Context**: Can be applied from seated position if taken to ground, provides path to dominant position
- **MMA Applications**: Modified version effective in MMA with cage awareness and striking considerations

## Historical Context

The hook sweep is a fundamental butterfly guard technique with roots in early Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu and wrestling. The butterfly guard itself was popularized by fighters like Marcelo Garcia who demonstrated its effectiveness at the highest levels of competition. The hook sweep showcases the core principle of using mechanical advantage to overcome size and strength disadvantages, making it a cornerstone technique for smaller practitioners.

## Safety Considerations

- **Controlled Application**: Smooth sweep execution prevents injury to both practitioners, avoid explosive force during initial learning
- **Mat Awareness**: Ensure adequate space around training area for safe completion and rolling
- **Partner Safety**: Controlled follow-through protects training partner from hard landing or impact
- **Gradual Progression**: Build up speed and power gradually, start with cooperative drilling before live resistance

## Position Integration

**Common combinations and sequences:**
- [[Butterfly Guard]] → [[Hook Sweep]] → [[Side Control Top]]
- [[Butterfly Guard]] → [[Hook Sweep]] → [[Arm Drag]] (if defended)
- [[Butterfly Guard]] → [[Hook Sweep]] → [[X-Guard Entry]] (if opponent bases)

## Related Techniques

- [[Butterfly Sweep]] - Similar mechanics with different finishing direction
- [[Arm Drag]] - Common setup technique that brings opponent forward for sweep
- [[X-Guard Entry]] - Alternative if opponent defends by posturing back
- [[Single Leg X Entry]] - Related guard transition with similar hook mechanics
