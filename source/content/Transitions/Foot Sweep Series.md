## State Machine Content Elements

### Visual Execution Sequence
Detailed step-by-step description for clear movement sequence visualization:

From standing position with collar and sleeve control, you create a circular movement pattern with your grips, pushing and pulling to induce your opponent to step in a predictable pattern. As they step or shift their weight, you read their footwork and identify the moment when their weight is transitioning from one foot to another. At the precise moment their weight is on one leg and the other foot is in motion or lightly touching the ground, you sweep that supporting or transitioning foot with the sole or inside edge of your foot. The key is timing the sweep to coincide with their weight transfer, using minimal force to remove the base point. Your grips continue the circular motion, pulling them in the direction of the sweep to complete the off-balance. The opponent falls to the ground as you maintain grip control and follow through to secure a dominant top position such as side control or knee on belly.

**Template**: "From standing with collar-sleeve grips, create circular movement to induce stepping. Read opponent's footwork pattern and identify weight transition. Time sweep to contact supporting foot during weight transfer using sole or edge of foot. Continue circular pulling motion to complete off-balance. Follow through to dominant top position."

### Execution Steps (Numbered Sequence)
1. **Setup Requirements**: Establish strong collar and sleeve grips from standing position
2. **Initial Movement**: Create circular movement pattern with grips to induce stepping
3. **Opponent Response**: Opponent steps or shifts weight to maintain balance
4. **Adaptation**: Read stepping pattern and select appropriate sweep timing
5. **Completion**: Time sweep to contact supporting foot as weight transfers
6. **Consolidation**: Follow through to land in dominant top position

### Key Technical Details
Critical elements that determine success:
- **Grip Requirements**: Strong collar and sleeve control to create circular motion
- **Base/Foundation**: Maintaining own balance while sweeping opponent's foot
- **Timing Windows**: Sweep must coincide exactly with opponent's weight transfer
- **Leverage Points**: Foot contact combined with grip direction creates off-balance
- **Common Adjustments**: Switch between different sweeps based on stepping pattern

### Success Modifiers
Factors that increase/decrease probability:
- **Setup Quality**: Creating effective circular movement pattern (+/-15%)
- **Timing Precision**: Executing sweep at exact moment of weight transfer (+/-25%)
- **Opponent Fatigue**: Reduced balance and defensive reactions (+/-5%)
- **Knowledge Test Performance**: Understanding sweep timing principles (+/-10%)
- **Position Control**: Quality of grip control and direction (+/-15%)

## Counter-Attack Analysis

### Common Counters
Opponent responses with success rates:
- **Weight Adjustment**: Quickly shifting weight to swept foot → [[Standing Position]] (Success Rate: 35%, Conditions: early recognition)
- **Step Through**: Stepping through the sweep attempt → [[Clinch Position]] (Success Rate: 40%, Conditions: good footwork)
- **Counter Sweep**: Using sweep momentum for own takedown → [[Top Position]] (Success Rate: 25%, Conditions: superior timing)
- **Pull Guard**: Sitting to guard to avoid sweep → [[Guard Bottom]] (Success Rate: 30%, Conditions: defensive choice)

Format: `[[Counter Technique]] → [[Result State]] (Success Rate: X%, Conditions: [when applicable])`

### Decision Logic
```
If [sweep timing] is recognized early:
- Execute [[Weight Adjustment]] (Probability: 35%)

Else if [footwork] allows stepping through:
- Execute [[Step Through]] (Probability: 40%)

Else if [defensive pull] is available:
- Execute [[Pull Guard]] (Probability: 30%)

Else if [momentum can be redirected]:
- Execute [[Counter Sweep]] (Probability: 25%)

Else [optimal sweep execution]:
- Accept transition (Probability: Success Rate - Modifiers)
```

## Educational Content

### Expert Insights
Commentary as if from recognized authorities:
- **John Danaher**: "Foot sweeps represent the highest expression of timing and technique over strength in takedowns. The secret is understanding that you're not forcing the opponent down - you're removing their base at precisely the moment they need it most. The circular movement pattern with your grips creates a rhythm that induces stepping, and within that rhythm lies multiple opportunities for different sweeps. This is chess at high speed."
- **Gordon Ryan**: "In competition, foot sweeps are incredibly effective because they require minimal energy and create immediate scoring opportunities. I use them constantly to keep opponents moving and uncertain about their footing. The key is recognizing patterns in how your opponent steps - everyone has habitual footwork. Once you identify their pattern, you can predict exactly when to sweep. It's like reading a book you've memorized."
- **Eddie Bravo**: "Foot sweeps integrate perfectly with modern grappling because they work equally well in gi and no-gi. In the 10th Planet system, we use them to create entries for our guard pulling and takedown sequences. The beauty is that even a failed foot sweep often creates the reaction you need for your next attack. It's low-risk, high-reward when you understand the timing principles."

Each insight should focus on one key technical or strategic element.

### Common Errors
For knowledge test generation:
- **Error**: Attempting sweep without proper grip control
- **Why It Fails**: Cannot create circular movement pattern to induce stepping
- **Correction**: Establish strong grips and use push-pull motion to create rhythm
- **Recognition**: Opponent remains stationary or moves unpredictably

- **Error**: Poor timing - sweeping when weight is not transferring
- **Why It Fails**: Opponent's supporting foot is stable and planted firmly
- **Correction**: Time sweep for exact moment of weight transition between feet
- **Recognition**: Sweep has no effect or opponent easily maintains balance

- **Error**: Using too much force or trying to force the sweep
- **Why It Fails**: Telegraphs intention and allows opponent to adjust
- **Correction**: Use minimal force at perfect timing to remove base point
- **Recognition**: Opponent anticipates and defends or counters the sweep

### Timing Considerations
When to attempt this transition:
- **Optimal Conditions**: When opponent is moving with predictable stepping pattern
- **Avoid When**: Opponent is stationary with low, defensive stance
- **Setup Sequences**: After establishing circular movement pattern with grips
- **Follow-up Windows**: Must chain multiple sweep attempts to create openings

### Prerequisites
Requirements before attempting:
- **Technical Skills**: Advanced standing grip fighting and timing recognition
- **Physical Preparation**: Balance and hip mobility for sweeping motion
- **Positional Understanding**: Standing position mechanics and kuzushi principles
- **Experience Level**: Advanced technique requiring exceptional timing
