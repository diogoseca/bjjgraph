# Leg Drag Control
#bjj #transition #guard_pass #leg_drag #advanced

## Visual Execution Sequence

From open guard top, you establish grips on the opponent's legs or pants. As they establish guard hooks or frames, you grip one leg and drive it across their centerline to the opposite side, "dragging" it past their other leg. This creates immediate off-balancing and exposes their back. Your body follows the dragged leg, moving to the side and creating an angle. You maintain control of the dragged leg while your other hand controls their upper body, preventing them from turning to face you. The result is a dominant position with access to back take or side control.

**One-Sentence Summary**: "From open guard top with leg control, you drag one leg across their centerline while moving to the side, creating back exposure and positional dominance."

## Execution Steps

1. **Setup Requirements**: Establish open guard top with grips on leg or pants
2. **Initial Movement**: Grip one leg and begin to move it across opponent's centerline
3. **Opponent Response**: Opponent tries to maintain guard structure or turn to face you
4. **Adaptation**: Drive leg aggressively across while moving your body to the side angle
5. **Completion**: Secure dragged leg position, establish upper body control
6. **Consolidation**: Choose between back take or side control based on opponent's reaction

## Key Technical Details

- **Grip Requirements**: Leg/pants grip, or ankle control; upper body control (collar, head)
- **Base/Foundation**: Create angle by moving to side, not driving straight forward
- **Timing Windows**: Execute when opponent's guard structure is momentarily open
- **Leverage Points**: Dragging leg across creates leverage, prevents guard recovery
- **Common Adjustments**: Vary angle of drag, adjust speed based on opponent's reaction

## Common Counters

- **[[Turn In Defense]]** ’ [[Guard Recovered]] (Success Rate: 45%, Conditions: opponent fast turn)
- **[[Leg Recovery]]** ’ [[Guard Maintained]] (Success Rate: 40%, Conditions: strong leg control)
- **[[Scramble to Knees]]** ’ [[Neutral Position]] (Success Rate: 35%, Conditions: explosive response)

## Expert Insights

### John Danaher
"The leg drag is one of the most modern and effective guard passing techniques. It creates immediate back exposure while maintaining control. The key is the angle - you must move to the side, not just pull the leg. Combined with proper upper body control, it's very difficult to defend."

### Gordon Ryan
"Leg drag is fundamental to my passing game. I use it constantly because it leads directly to back takes or dominant side control. Speed matters - you need to move your body to the angle quickly. The leg control without the angle doesn't work."

### Eddie Bravo
"Leg drags are less common in 10th Planet because we focus on different angles, but the principle is sound - control one leg, create angles, dominate position. Whatever passing style you use, angles and control beat strength."

## Common Errors

### Error 1: Pulling Leg Without Moving Body
- **Why It Fails**: Opponent can simply turn to face you and recover guard
- **Correction**: Move your body to the angle as you drag the leg
- **Recognition**: Opponent easily squares back up to you

### Error 2: Insufficient Upper Body Control
- **Why It Fails**: Opponent turns into you and recovers guard
- **Correction**: Control collar/head with free hand immediately
- **Recognition**: Opponent following your movement and re-establishing guard

### Error 3: Wrong Timing
- **Why It Fails**: Opponent's guard structure is too strong
- **Correction**: Wait for moment of guard opening or create it with feints
- **Recognition**: Feeling heavy resistance to leg drag attempt
