- **Transition Name**: X-Guard Sweep
- **Alternative Names**: X-Guard to Top, Double Hook Sweep, X-Sweep

### State Machine Properties
- **Starting State**: [[X-Guard Bottom]]
- **Ending State**: [[Top Position]], [[Side Control Top]]
- **Transition Type**: Attack - sweeping technique

### Transition Properties

- **Speed Requirements**: Medium for timing-dependent execution

## State Machine Content Elements

### Visual Execution Sequence
Detailed step-by-step description for clear movement sequence visualization:

From X-Guard bottom position, you have established control with your top leg hooked inside their thigh, your bottom leg hooked behind their same leg's knee, and your arms controlling their ankle and/or pant leg. Your opponent is standing above you, attempting to maintain their balance while dealing with your leg control. You extend your bottom leg forcefully while simultaneously pulling their ankle toward you, which eliminates their base on that side. As their weight shifts, you sweep your top leg through in the direction of the off-balance, using it as a sweeping force to topple them over. You follow through with your body rotation, coming up on top of them as they fall. You immediately work to pass their legs or establish a dominant position like side control or mount, maintaining forward pressure to prevent them from recovering guard.

**Template**: "From X-Guard with double leg hooks and ankle control, extend bottom leg while pulling ankle. Sweep top leg through to topple opponent, follow rotation to establish top position."

### Execution Steps (Numbered Sequence)
1. **Setup Requirements**: Establish X-Guard with both leg hooks controlling opponent and ankle grip
2. **Initial Movement**: Extend bottom leg forcefully while pulling controlled ankle toward you
3. **Opponent Response**: Opponent attempts to maintain balance or free their leg
4. **Adaptation**: Sweep top leg through in direction of off-balance
5. **Completion**: Follow through with body rotation to come up on top
6. **Consolidation**: Pass to side control or mount while maintaining forward pressure

### Key Technical Details
Critical elements that determine success:
- **Grip Requirements**: Strong ankle control with hands or arms
- **Base/Foundation**: Double hook system creating unstable base for opponent
- **Timing Windows**: Execute when opponent's weight is centered or they attempt to step
- **Leverage Points**: Leg extension and ankle pull working in combination
- **Common Adjustments**: Vary sweep direction based on opponent's base and reactions

### Success Modifiers
Factors that increase/decrease probability:
- **Setup Quality**: Tightness of hook control and ankle grip (+/-15%)
- **Timing Precision**: Executing during opponent's weight shift (+/-15%)
- **Opponent Fatigue**: Reduced balance and base stability (+/-5%)
- **Knowledge Test Performance**: Understanding leg control mechanics (+/-10%)
- **Position Control**: Quality of X-Guard structure (+/-10%)

## Counter-Attack Analysis

### Common Counters
Opponent responses with success rates:
- **Step Out**: Pulling leg free and stepping away → [[Standing Guard Top]] (Success Rate: 45%, Conditions: if hooks are loose)
- **Sit to Combat Base**: Sitting down to eliminate standing base → [[Half Guard Top]] (Success Rate: 40%, Conditions: quick reaction)
- **Ankle Lock Counter**: Attacking exposed leg during sweep → [[Leg Lock Position]] (Success Rate: 35%, Conditions: if leg is exposed)
- **Jump Over**: Hopping over sweep to pass guard → [[Side Control Top]] (Success Rate: 30%, Conditions: if sweep is slow)

Format: `[[Counter Technique]] → [[Result State]] (Success Rate: X%, Conditions: [when applicable])`

### Decision Logic
```
If [hook control] is weak:
- Execute [[Step Out]] (Probability: 45%)

Else if [sweep is initiated]:
- Execute [[Sit to Combat Base]] (Probability: 40%)

Else if [leg is exposed] during sweep:
- Execute [[Ankle Lock Counter]] (Probability: 35%)

Else [optimal sweep execution]:
- Accept transition (Probability: Success Rate - Modifiers)
```

## Educational Content

### Expert Insights
Commentary as if from recognized authorities:
- **John Danaher**: "The X-Guard sweep exemplifies the principle of base manipulation through systematic leg control. By establishing double hooks on a single leg, you create a situation where your opponent's base is fundamentally compromised. The bottom hook behind their knee prevents them from posting that leg back, while the top hook inside their thigh prevents them from widening their base. The ankle control completes the trap. When you extend your bottom leg while pulling the ankle, you create simultaneous forces that make maintaining balance impossible. The key is timing the extension with their weight shift."
- **Gordon Ryan**: "In competition, X-Guard has become one of my most reliable sweeping positions. The beauty of it is that your opponent knows what's coming but often can't prevent it if your control is tight. I focus on making my ankle control unbreakable and my hooks deep. The sweep itself needs to be explosive - extend that bottom leg hard and follow through immediately to establish top position. The transition from bottom to top can happen so fast they don't have time to defend. It's a high-percentage technique at all levels."
- **Eddie Bravo**: "X-Guard fits perfectly into modern guard systems because it's a position where you have multiple options. We use it in 10th Planet as a transition position - you can sweep, you can go to back takes, you can enter leg locks. The classic X-Guard sweep is effective, but I teach my students to see it as part of a larger system. If they defend the sweep, you have other attacks ready. If they defend those, you can return to the sweep. It's about creating dilemmas."

Each insight should focus on one key technical or strategic element.

### Common Errors
For knowledge test generation:
- **Error**: Shallow hooks that don't control opponent's leg
- **Why It Fails**: Opponent can easily free their leg and step out
- **Correction**: Establish deep hooks with pressure behind knee and inside thigh
- **Recognition**: Opponent easily pulls leg free during sweep attempt

- **Error**: Extending leg without pulling ankle simultaneously
- **Why It Fails**: Creates only partial off-balance, insufficient for sweep
- **Correction**: Coordinate leg extension and ankle pull as single action
- **Recognition**: Opponent maintains balance despite leg extension

- **Error**: Not following through with body rotation
- **Why It Fails**: Sweep initiates but doesn't complete to top position
- **Correction**: Rotate your body up as opponent falls to establish top position
- **Recognition**: Opponent falls but ends in neutral or recovers guard

- **Error**: Releasing control too early after sweep
- **Why It Fails**: Opponent recovers guard or scrambles to better position
- **Correction**: Maintain forward pressure and immediately begin passing
- **Recognition**: Ending in scramble situation rather than dominant position

- **Error**: Sweeping against opponent's strong base side
- **Why It Fails**: Opponent can post and prevent being swept
- **Correction**: Sweep in direction where their base is weakest
- **Recognition**: Sweep feels heavy and opponent easily defends

### Timing Considerations
When to attempt this transition:
- **Optimal Conditions**: When opponent is standing or attempting to free their leg
- **Avoid When**: Opponent has solid combat base or is sitting
- **Setup Sequences**: After establishing strong X-Guard from various entries
- **Follow-up Windows**: Must complete sweep within 3-5 seconds before counter

### Prerequisites
Requirements before attempting:
- **Technical Skills**: X-Guard entry and maintenance skills
- **Physical Preparation**: Hip flexibility and leg strength for hook control
- **Positional Understanding**: X-Guard mechanics and sweeping principles
- **Experience Level**: Intermediate technique requiring coordination and timing
