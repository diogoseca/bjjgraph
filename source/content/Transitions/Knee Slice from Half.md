# Knee Slice from Half
#bjj #transition #guard_pass #knee_slice #dynamic

## Visual Execution Sequence

From half guard top, you establish grips and create space to extract your trapped leg. Instead of pulling the leg straight back, you drive your knee across the opponent's legs in a slicing motion, cutting through their half guard. Your upper body controls their frames with collar or head control, preventing them from following you. Your knee slices across to the opposite side while your trailing leg steps over their bottom leg, resulting in side control with your knee driven past their guard.

**One-Sentence Summary**: "From half guard top with grip control, you slice your knee across opponent's legs while controlling frames, cutting through to side control."

## Execution Steps

1. **Setup Requirements**: Establish half guard top with grips (collar, head, or underhook)
2. **Initial Movement**: Create separation and angle your hips for knee insertion
3. **Opponent Response**: Opponent tries to maintain half guard hooks or establish frames
4. **Adaptation**: Use upper body control to suppress frames, drive knee aggressively across
5. **Completion**: Step trailing leg over, drive knee past their legs completely
6. **Consolidation**: Establish side control with knee pressure, secure crossface

## Key Technical Details

- **Grip Requirements**: Collar grip and sleeve control (gi), or head/arm control (no-gi)
- **Base/Foundation**: Create wide base with trailing leg, drive knee decisively
- **Timing Windows**: Execute when opponent is flat or you have strong upper body control
- **Leverage Points**: Knee drives through legs like wedge, upper body prevents following
- **Common Adjustments**: Vary angle of knee entry, adjust pressure based on resistance

## Common Counters

- **[[Underhook Defense]]** ’ [[Half Guard Maintained]] (Success Rate: 50%, Conditions: strong underhook)
- **[[Knee Shield Frame]]** ’ [[Guard Retention]] (Success Rate: 45%, Conditions: frames knee early)
- **[[Back Take Attempt]]** ’ [[Scramble]] (Success Rate: 30%, Conditions: opponent aggressive)

## Expert Insights

### John Danaher
"The knee slice from half requires decisive execution. Many people attempt it slowly, allowing opponent time to defend. The knee must slice through with authority while upper body control prevents them from turning into you. Speed and control combined."

### Gordon Ryan
"This is one of my highest percentage passes. The key is the angle - don't drive straight, drive at an angle that makes their defense harder. Upper body control is critical. Pin the frames, drive the knee, finish in side control. Smooth and fast."

### Eddie Bravo
"The knee slice is fundamental, but timing matters. We drill entries from lockdown and various half guard variations. Whatever the entry, the slice itself must be committed. Half speed won't work - you'll get stuck halfway."

## Common Errors

### Error 1: Insufficient Upper Body Control
- **Why It Fails**: Opponent follows your movement and recovers guard
- **Correction**: Establish strong grips/frames before attempting slice
- **Recognition**: Opponent easily turns into you during pass

### Error 2: Slow Knee Movement
- **Why It Fails**: Gives opponent time to establish frames or hooks
- **Correction**: Drive knee decisively once committed
- **Recognition**: Getting stuck mid-pass with opponent's frames stopping progress

### Error 3: Wrong Angle
- **Why It Fails**: Knee meets maximum resistance
- **Correction**: Angle knee to slice across, not drive straight down
- **Recognition**: Feeling stuck or heavy resistance despite good technique
