## Transition Description
The Sprawl is a fundamental defensive technique in Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu (BJJ) and wrestling used to counter an opponent's takedown attempt, transitioning from a Standing Position or Clinch Position to a Neutral Position or potentially a Top Position. This technique involves quickly dropping your hips and extending your legs backward to prevent the opponent from securing a grip on your legs or completing a takedown, effectively neutralizing their attack. It is particularly effective against single-leg and double-leg takedown attempts, embodying the BJJ principle of base and balance to defend against offensive maneuvers. The Sprawl is a key strategy in both gi and no-gi grappling, offering a high-percentage method to maintain a standing or neutral position and potentially gain an advantageous top control after defending the takedown.

## Visual Execution Sequence
Detailed description for clear visualization of the transition in action:

Starting from a Standing Position or Clinch Position, you face your opponent who is also standing, engaged in grip fighting with collar and sleeve grips in gi or over-under control in no-gi, as you remain alert for their takedown attempts like a single-leg or double-leg while maintaining a strong base with feet shoulder-width apart. As the opponent initiates a takedown by shooting in, dropping their level to grab your legs, you react instantly by recognizing the attack, beginning the Sprawl by dropping your hips downward and backward with explosive speed, simultaneously kicking your legs straight back to extend them out of their reach, ensuring your weight is low to prevent them from lifting or pulling you down. You drive your chest and shoulders forward to apply pressure on their upper back or head, using your hands to control their wrists or push down on their neck if possible, feeling their momentum stall as they struggle to complete the takedown against your extended base, with your toes digging into the mat for stability. With precise timing, you keep your hips heavy and low to maintain control over your balance, circling to the side or behind them if the opportunity arises, sensing their reaction as they either persist with the takedown attempt or disengage to stand back up. Mid-transition, you maintain control over their upper body with your hands or forearms to prevent them from adjusting their grip or transitioning to another attack, keeping your legs extended and weight forward to avoid being pulled into a vulnerable position, as you position yourself to either return to a Neutral Position by disengaging or transition to a Top Position by capitalizing on their lowered stance. You complete the Sprawl by either pushing them away to reset to a Neutral Position, standing back up with a strong base to continue the fight, or by securing a dominant angle to attack their back or side, potentially settling into a Top Position if they remain low or turtle, having successfully defended the takedown. Throughout the movement, you remain aware of their attempts to chain attacks, adjust grips, or counter with submissions, adjusting your hip pressure, hand control, and footwork to counter their responses, demonstrating an effective defensive technique that maintains your position or shifts the fight to an advantageous control.

**Template**: "From Standing Position or Clinch Position, facing opponent standing, grip fighting with collar and sleeve grips in gi or over-under control in no-gi, alert for takedown attempts like single-leg or double-leg, maintaining strong base with feet shoulder-width apart. React to takedown initiation as opponent shoots in, drop level to grab legs, begin Sprawl by dropping hips downward and backward explosively, kick legs straight back out of reach, keep weight low to prevent lift or pull. Drive chest and shoulders forward for pressure on upper back or head, control wrists or push neck with hands if possible, stall momentum as they struggle against extended base, toes dig into mat for stability. Keep hips heavy and low for balance control, circle to side or behind if opportunity arises, sense reaction as they persist or disengage to stand. Maintain upper body control mid-transition with hands or forearms to prevent grip adjustment or new attack, keep legs extended and weight forward to avoid vulnerability, position to return to Neutral Position by disengaging or transition to Top Position by capitalizing on lowered stance. Complete Sprawl by pushing away to reset to Neutral Position, stand with strong base to continue, or secure dominant angle to attack back or side for Top Position if they remain low or turtle, defend takedown successfully. Stay aware of chained attacks, grip adjustments, or submission counters, adjust hip pressure, hand control, footwork to counter, maintain position or shift to advantageous control."

## Execution Steps
1. Begin in a Standing Position or Clinch Position, maintaining awareness of the opponent's movements and recognizing the initiation of a takedown attempt when they drop their level to attack your legs.
2. React instantly by dropping your hips downward and backward with explosive speed, simultaneously kicking your legs straight back to extend them out of the opponent's reach.
3. Drive your chest and shoulders forward to apply pressure on their upper back or head, using your hands to control their wrists or push down on their neck to disrupt their momentum.
4. Keep your hips heavy and low to maintain control over your balance, ensuring your toes are dug into the mat for stability while circling to the side or behind if possible.
5. Maintain control over their upper body with your hands or forearms during the transition to prevent them from adjusting their grip or transitioning to another attack.
6. Complete the Sprawl by either pushing them away to reset to a Neutral Position, standing back up with a strong base, or securing a dominant angle to attack their back or side for a Top Position if they remain low.
7. Ensure control over your base and position to prevent recovery or follow-up attacks, preparing to continue the fight from a neutral or advantageous stance.
8. Remain aware of their defensive or offensive responses like chaining attacks or adjusting grips, adapting your hip pressure, hand control, and footwork to counter and consolidate the defense.

- **Chain Attack** → [[Single Leg Takedown]] (Success Rate: 25%, Conditions: opponent transitions to alternative takedown)
- **Posture Recovery** → [[Standing Position]] (Success Rate: 20%, Conditions: opponent disengages and stands back up)
- **Submission Attempt** → [[Guillotine Attempt]] (Success Rate: 15%, Conditions: opponent catches your head during sprawl)
- **Sweep Counter** → [[Bottom Position]] (Success Rate: 10%, Conditions: opponent uses your forward pressure for a sweep)

## Decision Logic for Transition
```
If [opponent initiates takedown] with level drop to attack legs:
- Initiate [[Sprawl]] to counter and defend (Probability: 75%)

Else if [scramble situation] involves potential takedown threat:
- Execute [[Sprawl]] for defense (Probability: 70%)

Else if [personal strategy] favors standing defense over engagement:
- Attempt [[Sprawl]] to maintain position (Probability: 65%)

Else if [opponent adjusts] with grip change or chained attack mid-defense:
- Adjust to [[Snap Down]] for counter-attack (Probability: 50%)

Else if [defense fails] due to successful takedown or submission threat:
- Transition to [[Guard Recovery]] to mitigate (Probability: 40%)
```

- **Correction**: React instantly with explosive hip drop as soon as takedown is initiated
- **Recognition**: Opponent gains control of legs or pulls you down

- **Error**: Insufficient leg extension or base
- **Why It Fails**: Leaves legs vulnerable to capture or loss of balance
- **Correction**: Kick legs straight back and keep toes dug into mat for stability
- **Recognition**: Feeling legs within reach or losing balance during sprawl

- **Error**: Lack of upper body pressure or control
- **Why It Fails**: Allows opponent to adjust or chain attacks without disruption
- **Correction**: Drive chest forward and control wrists or neck to stall momentum
