# Rolling Kimura
#bjj #transition #kimura #turtle #sweep

## Visual Execution Sequence

From turtle top with kimura grip established, you initiate a forward roll over your opponent's shoulder while maintaining the figure-four grip. The rolling motion uses your momentum to sweep them over, landing in top position with kimura control maintained. The combination of grip control and dynamic movement creates an inescapable sweeping force.

**One-Sentence Summary**: "From turtle top with kimura grip, roll forward over opponent's shoulder, sweeping them while maintaining figure-four control."

## Execution Steps

1. **Kimura Grip Setup**: Establish figure-four kimura grip from turtle top position
2. **Head Position**: Position your head near opponent's trapped arm side
3. **Initiation**: Drive forward and begin rolling over your outside shoulder
4. **Momentum**: Use rolling momentum to sweep opponent over
5. **Completion**: Land in top position with kimura control maintained
6. **Consolidation**: Secure top position and maintain shoulder lock control

## Key Technical Details

- **Grip Requirements**: Strong figure-four kimura grip that maintains through roll
- **Base/Foundation**: Commitment to forward roll, trust in technique
- **Timing Windows**: Execute when opponent's base is compromised or stationary
- **Leverage Points**: Rolling momentum + grip control = sweeping force
- **Common Adjustments**: Adjust rolling angle based on opponent's weight distribution

## Common Counters

Opponent defensive responses:

- **[[Base Out Hard]]** → [[Turtle Maintained]] (Success Rate: 40%, Conditions: early recognition and strong base)
- **[[Roll with Momentum]]** → [[Scramble Position]] (Success Rate: 30%, Conditions: timing and flexibility)
- **[[Release and Escape]]** → [[Stand Up]] (Success Rate: 25%, Conditions: quick reaction)

### Decision Logic
```
If [kimura grip not secure]:
- Execute [[Base Out]] (Probability: 40%)

Else if [roll initiated early]:
- Execute [[Counter Roll]] (Probability: 30%)

Else [optimal execution]:
- Accept transition (Base Success Rate - Applied Modifiers)
```

## Expert Insights

### John Danaher
"The rolling kimura exemplifies dynamic jiu-jitsu where submission grip becomes sweeping mechanism. The key is maintaining figure-four throughout the roll - grip integrity equals success."

### Gordon Ryan
"I use this frequently when opponents turtle defensively. The roll surprises them and the kimura grip gives multiple finish options from top position. Timing and commitment are critical."

### Eddie Bravo
"Classic technique that fits the 10th Planet system perfectly. The dynamic nature creates opportunities even if the roll doesn't complete perfectly. Maintain grip and adapt."

## Common Errors

### Error 1: Loose Kimura Grip
- **Why It Fails**: Grip loosens during roll, opponent escapes
- **Correction**: Lock figure-four tightly before initiating roll
- **Recognition**: Arm slips out mid-technique

### Error 2: Hesitant Roll
- **Why It Fails**: Insufficient commitment results in incomplete sweep
- **Correction**: Commit fully to forward roll motion
- **Recognition**: Getting stuck mid-roll

### Error 3: Wrong Rolling Direction
- **Why It Fails**: Rolling over wrong shoulder reduces effectiveness
- **Correction**: Roll over outside shoulder (opposite side from kimura)
- **Recognition**: Opponent easily maintains base

## Timing Considerations

- **Optimal Conditions**: Opponent stationary in turtle, kimura grip secured
- **Avoid When**: Opponent has strong dynamic defense, base is very wide
- **Setup Sequences**: After failed back take attempts, during turtle control
- **Follow-up Windows**: Must consolidate top position within 2-3 seconds

## Prerequisites

- **Technical Skills**: Kimura grip mechanics, forward rolling ability
- **Physical Preparation**: Core strength, rolling coordination
- **Positional Understanding**: Turtle top control, grip fighting
- **Experience Level**: Intermediate - requires coordination and timing

## Knowledge Assessment

1. **Which shoulder do you roll over?** Outside shoulder (opposite side from kimura grip)
2. **Most critical element?** Maintaining figure-four grip throughout entire roll
3. **When to initiate?** When kimura is locked and opponent's base is compromised
4. **Primary failure point?** Grip loosening during roll motion
5. **Follow-up priority?** Consolidating top position with maintained kimura control

## Variants and Adaptations

- **Gi Specific**: Can use lapel grip for additional control during roll
- **No-Gi Specific**: Tighter figure-four required due to sweat/slippage
- **Competition**: High-percentage technique for dynamic points
- **Size Differential**: Smaller practitioners benefit from momentum advantage

## Training Progressions

1. **Solo Practice**: Forward rolling mechanics without partner
2. **Cooperative Drilling**: Partner allows sweep completion
3. **Resistant Practice**: Partner provides progressive defensive base
4. **Sparring Integration**: Live application from turtle situations
5. **Troubleshooting**: Correcting grip and timing issues in real-time

## Competition Applications

- **IBJJF Rules**: Legal at all belt levels, scores as sweep (2 points) if successful
- **No-Gi Competition**: Effective in submission grappling with tight grip
- **MMA Applications**: Useful for ground transitions and control
