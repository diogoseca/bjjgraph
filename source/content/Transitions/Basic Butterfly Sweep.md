## Transition Description
The Basic Butterfly Sweep is a fundamental technique that uses the butterfly hooks under the opponent's thighs to elevate and off-balance them, allowing the bottom player to come on top. This sweep leverages mechanical advantage through proper hook placement, upper body control, and coordinated timing to efficiently reverse positions. It serves as the foundation for the entire butterfly guard sweeping system and is considered one of the highest-percentage sweeps in Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu.

## Execution Steps
1. From butterfly guard, establish a solid seated base with good posture
2. Insert butterfly hooks (feet) inside opponent's thighs
3. Secure an underhook on one side and sleeve/collar control on the other
4. Pull opponent forward to compromise their posture
5. Elevate opponent's weight with butterfly hooks while pulling with upper body control
6. As opponent becomes elevated, angle toward the underhook side
7. Use your head as a fifth point of base by posting it on the mat
8. Continue the motion to come on top, maintaining control of opponent's arm
9. Establish side control or combat base as you complete the transition

## Key Grips/Controls
- Underhook on one side (primary control)
- Sleeve or collar grip on opposite side
- Active butterfly hooks under opponent's thighs
- Head positioning to create angle
- Hip connection throughout movement
- Leg drive through feet/hooks

## Common Counters
- [[Base Widening]] → [[Hook Ineffectiveness]]
- [[Crossface Counter]] → [[Flattened Butterfly]]
- [[Limp Arm Escape]] → [[Standing Defense]]
- [[Backstep]] → [[Leg Drag Position]]
- [[Pressure Forward]] → [[Smash Pass Attempt]]

## Variants
- Two-on-one butterfly sweep (double underhooks)
- Arm drag butterfly sweep (focusing on back exposure)
- Gi-specific grip variations (collar/sleeve combinations)
- No-gi control variations (wrist/neck control)
- Single butterfly hook variation (half butterfly)

## Expert Insights
- **Danaher System**: Emphasizes the "elevator principle" where hooks simultaneously elevate while upper body controls prevent defensive posting. Focuses on precise angles and head positioning to maximize mechanical advantage. Creates a "sweep chain" where the basic butterfly sweep is connected to multiple follow-ups based on defensive reactions.
- **Gordon Ryan**: Often adds a subtle detail of momentarily releasing the underhook during elevation to reestablish it at a better angle during the sweep. Emphasizes immediately securing upper body control as you land on top to prevent defensive scrambles.
- **Eddie Bravo**: Incorporates unique gripping variations, often using overhooks rather than traditional underhooks. Connects the butterfly sweep to immediate submission attacks, particularly the guillotine and darce sequences as the opponent defends.

## Timing Considerations
- Execute when opponent's weight is forward
- Time with opponent's movement or breathing rhythm
- Perform immediately after breaking opponent's posture
- Use when opponent is attempting to establish their own grips
- Implement as counter to aggressive forward pressure

## Follow-up Options
- [[Side Control Consolidation]] → [[Side Control]]
- [[Mount Transition]] → [[Mount]]
- [[Knee Slice Pass]] → [[Side Control]]
- [[Kimura Trap]] → [[Kimura Control]]
- [[Near Side Armbar]] → [[Armbar Control]]

## Common Teaching Progression
1. Static practice with cooperative partner
2. Adding progressive resistance
3. Troubleshooting common defensive reactions
4. Integrating into specific sparring scenarios
5. Connecting to follow-up techniques in combinations

## Computer Science Analogy
The Basic Butterfly Sweep represents a highly efficient edge in the BJJ state graph, with exceptional success probability (weight) connecting the Butterfly Guard node to the advantageous Top Position node. This transition has one of the highest expected values in the open guard subsystem due to its mechanical efficiency and the limited defensive options it allows.
