## State Machine Content Elements

### Visual Execution Sequence
Detailed step-by-step description for clear movement sequence visualization:

From the closed guard bottom position, you start with your legs locked around the opponent's waist, maintaining control with your knees squeezed tight and feet hooked together behind their back, while observing their posture and weight distribution for the right moment to attack. As the opponent postures up or places one hand on the mat for base, you secure a strong grip on their opposite sleeve or wrist with both hands, using a two-on-one grip to isolate their arm, and simultaneously open your guard slightly to prepare for hip movement. You execute an arm drag by pulling their controlled arm across your body towards your opposite hip, breaking their posture and shifting their weight to one side, while planting your foot on the mat on the same side as the dragged arm to create a strong base. Using your hips, you swing your other leg like a pendulum in a wide arc towards the side of the trapped arm, building momentum to off-balance the opponent further, while pulling down with your grips to keep their upper body low. With a powerful hip thrust and continued leg swing, you roll the opponent over their trapped arm and shoulder, following through by coming up on top as they land on their back, establishing a dominant position such as mount, maintaining chest pressure and arm control to secure the sweep.

**Template**: "From closed guard bottom, lock legs around opponent's waist, watch posture. Grip opposite sleeve with two-on-one, open guard slightly for hips. Drag arm across body to break posture, plant foot on mat for base. Swing other leg in wide arc for momentum, pull down with grips. Thrust hips to roll opponent over trapped arm, come up to mount with control."

### Execution Steps (Numbered Sequence)
1. **Setup Requirements**: Start in closed guard with legs locked around opponent's waist
2. **Opponent Observation**: Monitor posture and weight distribution for opening
3. **Grip Control**: Secure two-on-one grip on opponent's sleeve or wrist
4. **Guard Adjustment**: Open guard slightly to allow hip mobility
5. **Arm Drag**: Pull opponent's arm across your body to break posture
6. **Foot Placement**: Plant foot on mat on dragged arm side for base
7. **Pendulum Motion**: Swing other leg wide to build momentum and off-balance
8. **Pull and Thrust**: Pull down with grips, thrust hips to initiate roll
9. **Follow Through**: Roll opponent over trapped arm, come up to top position

### Key Technical Details
Critical elements that determine success:
- **Closed Guard Control**: Strong leg lock to maintain initial position
- **Grip Strength**: Two-on-one hold to isolate and control opponent's arm
- **Arm Drag**: Effective pull to break posture and shift weight
- **Hip Mobility**: Powerful thrust and swing to create sweeping momentum
- **Timing**: Coordinating grip, drag, and hip movement for maximum effect

### Success Modifiers
Factors that increase/decrease probability:
- **Posture Break**: Effectiveness of arm drag in disrupting opponent's balance (+/-20%)
- **Grip Quality**: Strength of two-on-one control on sleeve or wrist (+/-15%)
- **Hip Thrust Power**: Force and timing of hip movement for sweep (+/-15%)
- **Opponent Weight Distribution**: Catching opponent during forward posture (+/-10%)
- **Knowledge Test Performance**: Understanding closed guard sweep mechanics (+/-10%)

## Counter-Attack Analysis

### Common Counters
Opponent responses with success rates:
- **Posture Recovery**: Regaining upright posture to resist drag → [[Closed Guard Top]] (Success Rate: 45%, Conditions: early recognition)
- **Arm Withdrawal**: Pulling arm free from grip → [[Neutral Position]] (Success Rate: 40%, Conditions: quick reaction)
- **Base Widening**: Posting legs wide to prevent roll → [[Top Position]] (Success Rate: 35%, Conditions: strong base)
- **Counter Sweep**: Using momentum for own sweep → [[Bottom Position]] (Success Rate: 20%, Conditions: advanced skill)

Format: `[[Counter Technique]] → [[Result State]] (Success Rate: X%, Conditions: [when applicable])`

### Decision Logic
```
If [sweep setup] is recognized early:
- Execute [[Posture Recovery]] (Probability: 45%)

Else if [arm grip] can be broken quickly:
- Execute [[Arm Withdrawal]] (Probability: 40%)

Else if [base] is strong for resistance:
- Attempt [[Base Widening]] (Probability: 35%)

Else [skill level] allows for counterattack:
- Attempt [[Counter Sweep]] (Probability: 20%)

Else [optimal execution]:
- Accept transition (Probability: Success Rate - Modifiers)
```

## Educational Content

### Expert Insights
Commentary as if from recognized authorities:
- **John Danaher**: "The Lumberjack Sweep is a fundamental closed guard technique that exemplifies the importance of breaking posture to create sweeping opportunities. The key lies in the arm drag and hip thrust, which must be synchronized to off-balance the opponent effectively. This move teaches critical principles of control and momentum that apply to all guard sweeps."
- **Gordon Ryan**: "In competition, the Lumberjack Sweep can be a high-percentage attack from closed guard, especially against opponents who posture aggressively. I use the two-on-one grip to isolate their arm and swing my leg with power to ensure the roll. The technique demonstrates how closed guard can be an offensive platform with proper timing."
- **Eddie Bravo**: "Lumberjack Sweep shows how closed guard techniques can be dynamic and aggressive, turning defense into attack with a strong arm drag. It integrates well with other guard systems and can surprise opponents who expect passive guard play. This move is perfect for grapplers who want to develop a fluid, momentum-based sweeping game."

Each insight should focus on one key technical or strategic element.

### Common Errors
For knowledge test generation:
- **Error**: Ineffective arm drag or posture break
- **Why It Fails**: Fails to shift opponent's weight, making sweep difficult
- **Correction**: Pull arm across body with force, ensure posture is disrupted
- **Recognition**: Opponent maintains upright posture during attempt

- **Error**: Poor hip mobility or weak thrust
- **Why It Fails**: Lacks momentum to roll opponent over trapped arm
- **Correction**: Swing leg wide and thrust hips powerfully to create force
- **Recognition**: Sweep stalls mid-way or opponent resists roll

- **Error**: Incorrect foot placement or base
- **Why It Fails**: Reduces leverage and stability for completing sweep
- **Correction**: Plant foot firmly on mat on dragged arm side for strong base
- **Recognition**: Difficulty initiating roll or maintaining control

### Timing Considerations
When to attempt this transition:
- **Optimal Conditions**: When opponent postures up or places hand on mat
- **Avoid When**: Opponent maintains low, defensive posture with strong base
- **Setup Sequences**: After establishing closed guard with grip control
- **Follow-up Windows**: Must complete sweep within 3-5 seconds to avoid counters

### Prerequisites
Requirements before attempting:
- **Technical Skills**: Understanding of closed guard control and sweep mechanics
- **Physical Preparation**: Hip strength and mobility for thrust and swing
- **Positional Understanding**: Control points in closed guard bottom
- **Experience Level**: Beginner to Intermediate - fundamental sweep with timing

## Technical Assessment Elements

### Knowledge Assessment Questions
5 technical questions with multiple choice answers:
- **Mechanical Understanding**: "What creates the momentum in a Lumberjack Sweep?"
- **Timing Recognition**: "When is the optimal moment to initiate the Lumberjack Sweep?"
- **Error Prevention**: "What is the most common mistake in executing Lumberjack Sweep?"
- **Setup Requirements**: "Which grip is essential for starting the Lumberjack Sweep?"
- **Adaptation**: "How do you adjust if the opponent resists the arm drag during the sweep?"

### Variants and Adaptations
Different versions for various scenarios:
- **Standard Lumberjack Sweep**: Two-on-one grip with pendulum leg swing
