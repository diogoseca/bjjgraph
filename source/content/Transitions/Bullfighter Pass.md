# Bullfighter Pass
#bjj #transition #pass #open_guard #speed

## Visual Execution Sequence

From open guard top position, you establish control of both opponent's ankles or pants with your hands. Your opponent attempts to maintain guard structure with their legs and frames. You lift their legs slightly while stepping to one side, using quick lateral movement to pass around their legs like a bullfighter avoiding a charge. The momentum of throwing their legs to one side while moving your hips in the opposite direction creates separation from their frames. You quickly transition past their legs, securing side control with chest pressure before they can recover guard.

**One-Sentence Summary**: "From open guard with ankle grips, you lift and throw their legs to one side while stepping laterally past, landing in side control."

## Execution Steps

1. **Setup Requirements**: Establish grips on both ankles or pants legs, maintaining upright posture and distance
2. **Initial Movement**: Lift opponent's legs slightly off the mat while staying mobile and balanced
3. **Opponent Response**: Opponent typically tries to kick legs free or establish frames to prevent pass
4. **Adaptation**: Choose direction based on opponent's resistance, preparing to move explosively
5. **Completion**: Throw legs to one side while stepping laterally past in opposite direction
6. **Consolidation**: Drop chest pressure on opponent's upper body, securing side control immediately

## Key Technical Details

- **Grip Requirements**: Bilateral ankle or pants grips for full leg control
- **Base/Foundation**: Wide mobile stance allowing quick lateral movement and direction changes
- **Timing Windows**: Execute when opponent extends legs or during their guard adjustment
- **Leverage Points**: Lifting and throwing legs creates momentum for lateral passing movement
- **Common Adjustments**: Change passing direction mid-motion based on opponent's defensive reactions

## Common Counters

Opponent defensive responses with success rates and conditions:

- **[[De La Riva Guard]]** ’ [[De La Riva Guard Bottom]] (Success Rate: 40%, Conditions: hooking leg before pass completion)
- **[[Sit Up Defense]]** ’ [[Seated Guard]] (Success Rate: 35%, Conditions: following legs during throw)
- **[[Frame and Shrimp]]** ’ [[Open Guard Bottom]] (Success Rate: 38%, Conditions: creating distance during transition)
- **[[Inversion Entry]]** ’ [[Inverted Guard]] (Success Rate: 25%, Conditions: advanced defensive movement)

### Decision Logic for AI Opponent

```
If [leg control] is weak or unstable:
- Execute [[De La Riva Guard]] (Probability: 40%)

Else if [passing direction] is telegraphed:
- Execute [[Sit Up Defense]] (Probability: 35%)

Else if [timing window] allows for defensive frames:
- Execute [[Frame and Shrimp]] (Probability: 38%)

Else [optimal bullfighter conditions]:
- Accept transition (Probability: Base Success Rate - Applied Modifiers)
```

## Expert Insights

### John Danaher
"The bullfighter pass exemplifies efficient passing through misdirection and momentum. By controlling the legs and creating lateral movement, you force the opponent to choose between following your movement or maintaining their guard structure. The key is using their leg extension against them, creating angles that make guard retention extremely difficult."

### Gordon Ryan
"In competition, I use the bullfighter pass as a high-speed option when opponents try to play distance-based open guards. The lateral movement combined with leg control makes it nearly impossible to establish hooks or frames. Speed and timing are everything - hesitation allows them to recover. Execute with confidence and land heavy in side control."

### Eddie Bravo
"The bullfighter is effective but you need to be aware of inversion threats and leg entanglement opportunities. Modern guard players use the bullfighter momentum against you. The key is controlling distance throughout - don't get baited into their trap. Use it when you have clear leg control and can commit fully to one direction."

## Common Errors

### Error 1: Insufficient leg lift before lateral movement
- **Why It Fails**: Legs remain connected to mat, allowing opponent to follow your movement easily
- **Correction**: Lift legs completely off mat before initiating lateral pass
- **Recognition**: Opponent easily tracks your movement and maintains guard

### Error 2: Throwing legs without moving hips laterally
- **Why It Fails**: Creates no actual passing angle, opponent simply recovers guard position
- **Correction**: Coordinate leg throw with explosive lateral hip movement in opposite direction
- **Recognition**: Ending up in same position after throwing legs

### Error 3: Hesitating after throwing legs
- **Why It Fails**: Gives opponent time to recover frames or re-establish guard
- **Correction**: Immediately follow leg throw with chest pressure and control establishment
- **Recognition**: Opponent recovers guard before you can secure position

### Error 4: Releasing leg grips too early
- **Why It Fails**: Allows opponent to kick legs back into guard position
- **Correction**: Maintain grips until past the legs and ready to establish upper body control
- **Recognition**: Opponent's legs return to guard structure mid-pass

### Error 5: Passing without controlling upper body landing zone
- **Why It Fails**: Opponent frames effectively as you arrive, preventing side control
- **Correction**: Secure underhook or crossface immediately upon passing legs
- **Recognition**: Getting stuck in scramble position after passing legs

## Timing Considerations

- **Optimal Conditions**: When opponent extends legs to create distance or during their guard adjustment
- **Avoid When**: Opponent has deep hook established or is actively inverting
- **Setup Sequences**: After breaking opponent's primary grips, or when they open guard to create space
- **Follow-up Windows**: Must establish side control within 1-2 seconds after passing legs

## Prerequisites

- **Technical Skills**: [[Grip Fighting]], [[Lateral Movement]], basic open guard passing concepts
- **Physical Preparation**: Footwork agility, quick direction changes, explosive lateral movement
- **Positional Understanding**: Open guard dynamics, passing angles, side control entries
- **Experience Level**: Intermediate - requires timing and coordination for effective execution

   - B) When you're in closed guard
   - C) When opponent extends legs or adjusts guard structure
   - D) When opponent is inverted
   - **Answer**: C

3. **Error Prevention**: "What is the most common mistake in bullfighter pass execution?"
   - A) Moving too quickly
   - B) Throwing legs without coordinating lateral hip movement
   - C) Gripping too tightly
   - D) Landing in mount instead of side control
   - **Answer**: B

4. **Setup Requirements**: "What grip control must be established before executing the bullfighter?"
   - A) One ankle grip only
   - B) Collar grips
   - C) Both ankles or pants legs
   - D) No grips necessary
   - **Answer**: C

5. **Adaptation**: "How should you adjust if opponent follows your initial passing direction?"
   - A) Give up and restart
   - B) Switch direction mid-motion using their momentum
   - C) Pull them back to center
   - D) Release grips immediately
   - **Answer**: B

## Variants and Adaptations

- **Gi Specific**: Use pants grips at ankles or knees for secure control throughout pass
- **No-Gi Specific**: Grip behind ankles or on shin area, emphasize speed over grip security
- **Self-Defense**: Modified for clothing grips when applicable in street scenarios
- **Competition**: Chain with other passes to create passing sequences and keep opponent guessing
- **Size Differential**: Smaller practitioners benefit from speed advantage, larger practitioners use power

## Training Progressions

1. **Solo Practice**: Footwork drills for lateral movement and direction changes
2. **Cooperative Drilling**: Partner allows pass to develop feel for timing and leg control
3. **Resistant Practice**: Partner provides progressive defense to test speed and commitment
4. **Sparring Integration**: Implementing pass during live rolling with setup recognition
5. **Troubleshooting**: Identifying hesitation points and improving decisive execution

### Common Troubleshooting Patterns

```yaml
troubleshooting:
  - symptom: "Opponent easily follows passing movement"
    likely_cause: "Insufficient leg lift or slow lateral movement"
    diagnostic_questions:
      - "Are you lifting legs completely off the mat?"
      - "Is your lateral movement explosive and committed?"
      - "Are you telegraphing your passing direction?"
    solution: "Lift legs higher, execute lateral movement explosively, vary passing direction to prevent anticipation"

  - symptom: "Losing leg grips during throw"
    likely_cause: "Weak grip or releasing too early"
    diagnostic_questions:
      - "Are your grips secure before initiating pass?"
      - "Are you releasing grips before clearing legs?"
      - "Is opponent kicking legs free?"
    solution: "Strengthen grips before passing, maintain control until fully past legs, anticipate kicks and adjust"

  - symptom: "Getting caught in scramble after passing legs"
    likely_cause: "No upper body control upon landing"
    diagnostic_questions:
      - "Are you establishing crossface or underhook immediately?"
      - "Is your chest pressure delayed?"
      - "Are you allowing opponent to frame?"
    solution: "Secure upper body control simultaneously with passing legs, drop chest pressure immediately, prevent frames"

## Competition Applications

- **IBJJF Rules**: Legal at all belt levels, scores 3 points for guard pass
- **No-Gi Competition**: Highly effective with adapted ankle grips
- **Self-Defense Context**: Quick passing option for establishing control
- **MMA Applications**: Modified version effective in mixed martial arts

## Historical Context

The bullfighter pass gained prominence through Brazilian competitors who emphasized speed and timing over pressure. The technique's name comes from the matador-like lateral movement that evades the opponent's legs similar to avoiding a charging bull. It has become a fundamental part of modern guard passing systems.

## Safety Considerations

- **Controlled Application**: Avoid excessive force when throwing legs to prevent hip injuries
- **Mat Awareness**: Ensure adequate space for lateral movement
- **Partner Safety**: Monitor landing pressure to avoid injuring partner's ribs
- **Gradual Progression**: Build speed gradually during learning phase

## Position Integration

**Common combinations and sequences:**
- [[Open Guard Top]] ’ [[Bullfighter Pass]] ’ [[Side Control]]
- [[Open Guard Top]] ’ [[Bullfighter Pass]] ’ [[Knee on Belly]] (if advanced)
- [[Open Guard Top]] ’ [[Bullfighter Pass]] ’ [[Leg Drag Pass]] (if first attempt defended)
