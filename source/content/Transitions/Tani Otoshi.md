- **Transition Name**: Tani Otoshi
- **Alternative Names**: Valley Drop, Body Drop, Sacrifice Throw

### State Machine Properties
- **Starting State**: [[Standing Position]], [[Clinch Position]]
- **Ending State**: [[Top Position]], [[Side Control]], [[X-Guard]]
- **Transition Type**: Attack - categorizes transition purpose

### Transition Properties
- **Success Probability**: Beginner 30%, Intermediate 55%, Advanced 75% - core probability data
- **Execution Complexity**: Medium - technical difficulty assessment
- **Energy Cost**: Medium - physical demand of execution
- **Time Required**: Quick - duration of transition
- **Risk Level**: Medium - chance of backfire or position loss

### Physical Requirements
- **Strength Requirements**: Medium for lifting and throwing motion
- **Flexibility Requirements**: Medium for proper body positioning
- **Coordination Requirements**: High for technical precision and timing
- **Speed Requirements**: High for timing-dependent execution

## State Machine Content Elements

### Visual Execution Sequence
Detailed step-by-step description for clear movement sequence visualization:

From standing position with collar and sleeve control, you step deep to the side of your opponent while maintaining upper body contact. Your opponent typically maintains their stance or attempts to counter-grip. You then sit down toward the mat while pulling them forward and over your leg, creating a sacrifice throw where you use your body as a fulcrum. The combination of your descending motion, forward pull, and leg obstruction causes them to fall over you as you control their landing, ending up in a dominant top position.

**Template**: "From standing with collar-sleeve grips, you step deep to the side and sit down while pulling them forward over your leg. Your opponent falls over you as you control their landing to achieve top position."

### Execution Steps (Numbered Sequence)
1. **Setup Requirements**: Establish strong collar and sleeve grips from standing position
2. **Initial Movement**: Step deep to the side with your outside foot
3. **Opponent Response**: Opponent typically tries to maintain balance or counter-grip
4. **Adaptation**: Adjust timing and direction based on their resistance
5. **Completion**: Sit down while pulling them forward and over your leg
6. **Consolidation**: Control their landing and secure top position

### Key Technical Details
Critical elements that determine success:
- **Grip Requirements**: Strong collar grip with one hand, sleeve control with other
- **Base/Foundation**: Deep side step and proper sitting motion for leverage
- **Timing Windows**: Execute when opponent's weight is slightly forward
- **Leverage Points**: Body position creates fulcrum for throwing motion
- **Common Adjustments**: Vary sitting angle and pull direction based on resistance

### Success Modifiers
Factors that increase/decrease probability:
- **Setup Quality**: Strong grips and proper foot positioning (+/-15%)
- **Timing Precision**: Executing during optimal weight distribution (+/-20%)
- **Opponent Fatigue**: Reduced defensive reactions and balance (+/-5%)
- **Knowledge Test Performance**: Understanding throw mechanics (+/-10%)
- **Position Control**: Quality of initial grip establishment (+/-10%)

## Counter-Attack Analysis

### Common Counters
Opponent responses with success rates:
- **Base Out**: Posting leg to prevent falling over thrower → [[Standing Position]] (Success Rate: 50%, Conditions: quick reaction)
- **Counter Throw**: Using momentum to reverse throw direction → [[Top Position]] (Success Rate: 40%, Conditions: superior timing)
- **Sprawl Defense**: Sprawling to avoid being pulled over → [[Standing Position]] (Success Rate: 45%, Conditions: early recognition)
- **Hip Check**: Using hip to block throwing motion → [[Clinch Position]] (Success Rate: 35%, Conditions: proper positioning)

Format: `[[Counter Technique]] → [[Result State]] (Success Rate: X%, Conditions: [when applicable])`

### Decision Logic
```
If [tani otoshi setup] is telegraphed early:
- Execute [[Base Out]] (Probability: 50%)

Else if [throw timing] can be reversed:
- Execute [[Counter Throw]] (Probability: 40%)

Else if [forward pull] can be avoided:
- Execute [[Sprawl Defense]] (Probability: 45%)

Else [optimal throw execution]:
- Accept transition (Probability: Success Rate - Modifiers)
```

## Educational Content

### Expert Insights
Commentary as if from recognized authorities:
- **John Danaher**: "Tani otoshi succeeds through precise timing and body positioning rather than brute strength. The key is understanding that this is a sacrifice throw - you must commit fully to the sitting motion while maintaining strong grips. The throw teaches fundamental principles of using your body as a lever that apply throughout grappling."
- **Gordon Ryan**: "In no-gi competition, tani otoshi is particularly effective because it can be adapted to various grip configurations and doesn't rely solely on traditional gi grips. I use it when opponents are resistant to other takedown attempts, as the sacrifice nature makes it difficult to sprawl or counter in traditional ways."
- **Eddie Bravo**: "Tani otoshi integrates well with other throwing techniques and can be modified for different situations. When the throw is partially defended, it often creates scramble situations that favor creative grapplers. The technique demonstrates how classical judo principles can be adapted for modern grappling."

Each insight should focus on one key technical or strategic element.

### Common Errors
For knowledge test generation:
- **Error**: Attempting throw without proper deep step positioning
- **Why It Fails**: Insufficient angle and leverage to create effective fulcrum
- **Correction**: Always step deep to the side before initiating sitting motion
- **Recognition**: Feeling unable to generate proper throwing force

- **Error**: Not committing fully to the sacrifice sitting motion
- **Why It Fails**: Incomplete commitment allows opponent to resist and counter
- **Correction**: Sit down completely while maintaining strong grip control
- **Recognition**: Opponent maintains balance despite throwing attempt

- **Error**: Poor grip control during throw execution
- **Why It Fails**: Weak grips allow opponent to escape during throw
- **Correction**: Maintain strong collar and sleeve grips throughout motion
- **Recognition**: Opponent slips free during throwing motion

### Timing Considerations
When to attempt this transition:
- **Optimal Conditions**: When opponent has slight forward momentum or pressure
- **Avoid When**: Opponent is heavily sprawling or very defensive
- **Setup Sequences**: After failed grip attempts that create forward reaction
- **Follow-up Windows**: Must complete within 2-3 seconds to prevent counter

### Prerequisites
Requirements before attempting:
- **Technical Skills**: Basic standing position control and grip fighting
- **Physical Preparation**: Hip flexibility and coordination for sacrifice motion
- **Positional Understanding**: Standing mechanics and off-balancing principles
- **Experience Level**: Intermediate technique requiring commitment and timing

## Technical Assessment Elements

### Knowledge Assessment Questions
5 technical questions with multiple choice answers:
- **Mechanical Understanding**: "What creates the throwing force in tani otoshi?"
- **Timing Recognition**: "When is the optimal moment to execute the sitting motion?"
- **Error Prevention**: "What is the most common positioning mistake?"
- **Setup Requirements**: "Which foot position is essential for proper execution?"
- **Adaptation**: "How do you adjust if opponent bases out during throw?"

### Variants and Adaptations
Different versions for various scenarios:
- **Gi Specific**: Traditional collar and sleeve grips maximize control
- **No-Gi Specific**: Adapt to overhook and underhook positions
- **Self-Defense**: Modified version for clothing grips in street situations
- **Competition**: Combination with other throws for scoring opportunities
- **Size Differential**: Effective for smaller practitioners using leverage advantage
