## State Machine Content Elements

### Visual Execution Sequence
Detailed step-by-step description for clear movement sequence visualization:

From open guard top position, you establish an X-pattern control by gripping one leg with your right hand on their right leg and your left hand on their left leg, creating a crossover configuration that pins both legs together. Your opponent typically attempts to separate their legs or create frames to prevent the pass. You stack their legs to one side while maintaining the cross grip, forcing both legs together in a controlled bundle. You then step your leg around the controlled legs while keeping them pinned, creating a passing angle that moves you around their guard. You clear the legs completely by moving your hips past their knees, immediately transitioning to side control. You establish shoulder pressure and cross-face control to prevent them from recovering guard.

**Template**: "From guard top with X-pattern leg control, stack legs to one side. Step around while keeping legs pinned together, clear hips past knees, establish side control."

### Execution Steps (Numbered Sequence)
1. **Setup Requirements**: Control both legs with crossover grip pattern forming X-shape
2. **Initial Movement**: Stack opponent's legs to one side while maintaining cross control
3. **Opponent Response**: Opponent attempts to separate legs or create defensive frames
4. **Adaptation**: Step around controlled legs while keeping them pinned together
5. **Completion**: Clear legs completely by moving hips past their knees
6. **Consolidation**: Establish side control with shoulder pressure and cross-face control

### Key Technical Details
Critical elements that determine success:
- **Grip Requirements**: Strong crossover grips on both legs creating X-pattern
- **Base/Foundation**: Wide base with good posture during leg control
- **Timing Windows**: Execute when opponent's legs are accessible and separated
- **Leverage Points**: Stacking pressure combined with stepping motion
- **Common Adjustments**: Switch stacking direction if opponent counters

### Success Modifiers
Factors that increase/decrease probability:
- **Setup Quality**: Tightness of crossover leg control (+/-15%)
- **Timing Precision**: Executing during opponent's guard opening (+/-10%)
- **Opponent Fatigue**: Reduced ability to maintain guard structure (+/-5%)
- **Knowledge Test Performance**: Understanding leg pinning mechanics (+/-10%)
- **Position Control**: Quality of stacking pressure (+/-10%)

## Counter-Attack Analysis

### Common Counters
Opponent responses with success rates:
- **Leg Separation**: Breaking cross grip to separate legs → [[Open Guard Bottom]] (Success Rate: 45%, Conditions: if grips are weak)
- **Hip Escape**: Shrimping away to create distance → [[Open Guard Bottom]] (Success Rate: 40%, Conditions: early movement)
- **Overhook Attempt**: Attacking passing arm for control → [[Half Guard Bottom]] (Success Rate: 35%, Conditions: if arm is extended)
- **Triangle Setup**: Attacking exposed posture during pass → [[Triangle Setup]] (Success Rate: 30%, Conditions: if posture is broken)

Format: `[[Counter Technique]] → [[Result State]] (Success Rate: X%, Conditions: [when applicable])`

### Decision Logic
```
If [cross grip] is weak:
- Execute [[Leg Separation]] (Probability: 45%)

Else if [passing motion] is initiated:
- Execute [[Hip Escape]] (Probability: 40%)

Else if [passing arm] is extended:
- Execute [[Overhook Attempt]] (Probability: 35%)

Else [optimal pass execution]:
- Accept transition (Probability: Success Rate - Modifiers)
```

## Educational Content

### Expert Insights
Commentary as if from recognized authorities:
- **John Danaher**: "The X-Pass exemplifies the principle of using grip configuration to control multiple points simultaneously. By establishing the crossover pattern, you effectively control both of the opponent's legs with just two grips, forcing them to work as a single unit rather than independently. This dramatically reduces their ability to create guards pace or establish hooks. The key is maintaining the cross pattern throughout the pass - if you release one grip prematurely, the guard retention becomes possible again. The stacking element further limits their hip mobility."
- **Gordon Ryan**: "In competition, I use the X-Pass as a reliable pressure passing option, especially against opponents with active open guards. The beauty of it is that once you establish the cross grips, they're fighting against their own leg structure. I focus on making my grips unbreakable and my stacking pressure constant. The pass itself needs to be methodical - don't rush around the legs, walk around them with control. It's a high-percentage pass because it neutralizes most guard retention systems."
- **Eddie Bravo**: "The X-Pass can be modified to work against various guard systems. While it's traditionally used against open guard, you can apply similar principles against butterfly guard and other leg-based guards. The crossover control is the key - it creates a situation where they need to address both legs simultaneously. If they defend one side, you can switch your passing direction. It's about creating control that limits their options while giving you multiple passing paths."

Each insight should focus on one key technical or strategic element.

### Common Errors
For knowledge test generation:
- **Error**: Weak or incorrect cross grip pattern
- **Why It Fails**: Allows opponent to separate legs and recover guard
- **Correction**: Establish true X-pattern with strong grips on both legs
- **Recognition**: Opponent easily breaks grips or separates legs

- **Error**: Insufficient stacking pressure on legs
- **Why It Fails**: Opponent can hip escape or create space
- **Correction**: Stack legs together forcefully while maintaining grips
- **Recognition**: Opponent creates distance during passing attempt

- **Error**: Stepping too early before legs are secured
- **Why It Fails**: Opponent inserts knee shield or recovers guard
- **Correction**: Ensure legs are pinned before beginning to step around
- **Recognition**: Opponent easily establishes half guard mid-pass

- **Error**: Poor posture during leg control
- **Why It Fails**: Exposes neck to submissions or allows opponent to break grips
- **Correction**: Maintain good posture with chest up and base wide
- **Recognition**: Opponent threatens submissions or easily breaks control

- **Error**: Not clearing hips completely past knees
- **Why It Fails**: Opponent recovers guard before side control is established
- **Correction**: Continue passing motion until hips are past their knees
- **Recognition**: Ending in half guard or having guard recovered

### Timing Considerations
When to attempt this transition:
- **Optimal Conditions**: When opponent's legs are separated and accessible
- **Avoid When**: Opponent has established strong defensive frames
- **Setup Sequences**: After breaking closed guard or from standing pass attempts
- **Follow-up Windows**: Must complete pass within 8-10 seconds before fatigue

### Prerequisites
Requirements before attempting:
- **Technical Skills**: Understanding of leg control and passing angles
- **Physical Preparation**: Grip strength and core stability for stacking
- **Positional Understanding**: Guard passing principles and leg management
- **Experience Level**: Intermediate technique requiring good control
