# Headquarters Pass
#bjj #transition #guard_pass #control

## Visual Execution Sequence

From headquarters position with one knee between opponent's legs and the other leg back, you maintain heavy shoulder pressure on their hips while controlling their far leg. You create a deliberate weight shift, using your shin to pin one leg while your opposite knee cuts across toward their opposite hip. As their leg is pinned and controlled, you drive your shoulder forward and walk your back leg around toward side control, maintaining connection throughout. Your chest settles onto theirs as you establish side control with their legs cleared and controlled.

**One-Sentence Summary**: "From headquarters with one knee in, pin opponent's leg with shin pressure while cutting other knee across to establish side control."

## Execution Steps

1. **Setup Requirements**: Establish headquarters position with one knee between legs; create shoulder pressure on hips; control far leg
2. **Initial Movement**: Pin near leg with shin; begin knee cut motion with back leg toward opposite hip
3. **Opponent Response**: Opponent attempts to create frames, recover guard with bottom leg, or create space
4. **Adaptation**: Maintain shoulder pressure; adjust knee cut angle based on their frames; keep leg control
5. **Completion**: Complete knee cut across body; drive chest forward; establish side control position
6. **Consolidation**: Secure crossface or underhook; settle weight; control opponent's mobility

## Key Technical Details

- **Grip Requirements**: Far leg control (ankle or knee grip); possible collar or underhook with other hand
- **Base/Foundation**: One knee between legs provides stable base; back leg ready to cut through
- **Timing Windows**: Execute when opponent's guard structure is compromised; during their adjustment moments
- **Leverage Points**: Shoulder pressure on hips; shin pin on near leg; knee cut driving force
- **Common Adjustments**: Vary knee cut angle; switch between pass variations; maintain connection

## Expert Insights

### John Danaher
"The headquarters position is fundamentally about maintaining control while methodically dismantling the guard. Your shin and knee create barriers that the opponent must overcome, while your shoulder pressure prevents them from sitting up or creating effective frames. The pass itself is a matter of patient pressure application combined with precise weight distribution - force alone won't work, but proper mechanics make it nearly inevitable."

### Gordon Ryan
"Headquarters is one of my highest percentage positions because you're controlling them while keeping multiple passing options open. They have to defend the knee cut, the leg weave, and the potential transition to other passes. I'm never committed to just one path - I read their defense and take what they give me. The key is that patient, heavy pressure that makes them carry your weight while trying to defend."

### Eddie Bravo
"We use headquarters a lot in 10th Planet because it works equally well gi and no-gi. That shin pressure is gold - it pins their leg without you having to use your hands, leaving your hands free for control and attacks. I teach students to treat headquarters like a position, not just a passing transition. You can hang out there, wear them down, then pass when their defense weakens."

## Common Errors

### Error 1: Standing Too Upright
- **Why It Fails**: Losing shoulder pressure allows opponent to create frames and recover guard
- **Correction**: Maintain heavy shoulder pressure throughout; stay connected to their hips
- **Recognition**: Opponent easily creates space or recovers guard

### Error 2: Knee Cutting Without Shin Pin
- **Why It Fails**: Near leg isn't controlled, allowing opponent to re-guard or create frames
- **Correction**: Ensure shin is pinning near leg before committing to knee cut
- **Recognition**: Near leg pops back to guard during pass attempt

### Error 3: Rushing the Pass
- **Why It Fails**: Headquarters is about control; rushing creates scrambles
- **Correction**: Be patient; let pressure work; pass when opening appears
- **Recognition**: Creating scrambles rather than methodical passes

## Timing Considerations

- **Optimal Conditions**: When opponent's guard structure is compromised; after wearing them down with pressure
- **Avoid When**: Opponent has strong frames established; their mobility is high
- **Setup Sequences**: After initial guard opening; following other passing attempts; when opponent adjusts position
- **Follow-up Windows**: Must establish side control within 2-3 seconds of completing cut

## Prerequisites

- **Technical Skills**: Understanding of pressure passing; knee cut mechanics; base management
- **Physical Preparation**: Hip mobility; core strength for pressure; shoulder stability
- **Positional Understanding**: Guard passing principles; headquarters position theory
- **Experience Level**: Intermediate; requires pressure passing understanding

## Knowledge Assessment

1. **Mechanical Understanding**: "What creates the control in headquarters pass?"
   - A) Only the knee between legs
   - B) Shin pressure, shoulder pressure, and controlled weight distribution
   - C) Speed alone
   - D) Standing pressure
   - **Answer**: B

2. **Timing Recognition**: "When should you commit to the knee cut?"
   - A) Immediately upon reaching headquarters
   - B) When shin is pinning near leg and shoulder pressure is established
   - C) When standing upright
   - D) Never
   - **Answer**: B

3. **Error Prevention**: "What is the most common mistake in headquarters passing?"
   - A) Maintaining too much pressure
   - B) Being too patient
   - C) Standing too upright and losing shoulder pressure
   - D) Too much shin pressure
   - **Answer**: C

4. **Setup Requirements**: "What must be controlled before beginning the knee cut?"
   - A) Nothing
   - B) Near leg with shin pressure and far leg with grip
   - C) Only far leg
   - D) Neither leg
   - **Answer**: B

5. **Adaptation**: "If opponent creates frames during pass, what should you do?"
   - A) Give up
   - B) Force through with strength
   - C) Adjust angle, maintain pressure, wait for better opportunity
   - D) Stand up completely
   - **Answer**: C

## Variants and Adaptations

- **Gi Specific**: Can use gi grips on pants and collar for enhanced control
- **No-Gi Specific**: Relies more on shoulder pressure and body control without gi grips
- **Self-Defense**: Maintains superior position while transitioning
- **Competition**: High-percentage passing for conservative, control-oriented approach
- **Size Differential**: Smaller practitioners use technical precision; larger add more pressure

## Training Progressions

1. **Solo Practice**: Practice knee cut motion and weight distribution
2. **Cooperative Drilling**: Partner allows pass to learn mechanics
3. **Resistant Practice**: Partner provides realistic guard retention
4. **Sparring Integration**: Use headquarters in live rolling
5. **Troubleshooting**: Identify why passes fail and adjust
