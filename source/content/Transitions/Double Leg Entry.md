## Technique Properties

- **Target Position**: [[Double leg takedown]]
- **Difficulty Level**: Intermediate
- **Energy Efficiency**: Medium

## Technique Description
The Double Leg Entry is a fundamental takedown setup that creates the optimal positioning and angles required for executing a successful double leg takedown. Unlike the takedown itself, which focuses on the completion mechanics after contact, the entry emphasizes the critical preliminary phase where distance is closed, level is changed, and initial penetration occurs. This technique involves strategic footwork, level changes, timing, and setup maneuvers that place the practitioner in position to penetrate effectively while neutralizing the opponent's defensive reactions. A properly executed Double Leg Entry dramatically increases the success probability of the subsequent takedown by compromising the opponent's defensive posture and balance before they can establish effective counters, making it a critical skill for any practitioner seeking to develop a reliable offensive takedown game.

## Execution Steps
1. Establish proper stance with lead foot forward, knees slightly bent, and weight centered
2. Create entry opportunity through feints, level changes, or timed reactions to opponent's movement
3. Drop level by bending knees while maintaining upright spine and head position
4. Step forward with lead leg while driving forward with rear leg for explosive penetration
5. Align head, hands, and hips in coordinated line of attack
6. Time penetration step with opponent's weight shift or movement
7. Transition seamlessly from entry to penetration phase of the takedown
8. Maintain defensive awareness throughout to counter potential sprawls or other defenses

## Key Details
- **Stance Configuration**: Balanced athletic posture with slight forward weight bias
- **Level Change Mechanics**: Dropping center of gravity while maintaining spinal alignment
- **Head Position**: Head up during setup, positioned properly during level change
- **Entry Angle**: Slight angle often preferable to direct frontal approach
- **Distance Management**: Critical closing of space at precisely the right moment
- **Timing Recognition**: Identifying optimal windows for penetration
- **Setup Integration**: Creating openings through misdirection or reaction exploitation
- **Defensive Awareness**: Maintaining readiness to abort or counter defenses

## Common Obstacles
- [[Defensive Posture]] → [[Penetration Difficulty]]
- [[Sprawl Defense]] → [[Entry Shutdown]]
- [[Head Position Counter]] → [[Directional Control Loss]]
- [[Distance Control]] → [[Entry Timing Disruption]]
- [[Underhook Defense]] → [[Angle Restriction]]
- [[Crossface Counter]] → [[Entry Deflection]]

## Variations
- Standard Double Leg Entry (basic level change and penetration)
- Feint Entry (using fake attacks to create openings)
- Reaction-based Entry (capitalizing on opponent's movements)
- Tie-up Entry (entering from collar tie or other grip)
- Angle Entry (attacking at an oblique angle rather than head-on)
- Combination Entry (following failed takedown attempt)

## Application Contexts
- [[Competitive BJJ]] - Primary standing strategy with or without gi
- [[Wrestling Crossover]] - Core technique in wrestling-focused training
- [[MMA Application]] - Modified for striking defense awareness
- [[Self-Defense]] - Practical application for controlling confrontation
- [[Takedown Strategy]] - Central component in standing game development
- [[Grip Fighting Context]] - Adaptation based on grip exchanges

## Setup Opportunities
- [[Stance Adjustment]] → [[Double Leg Entry]]
- [[Failed Single Leg]] → [[Double Leg Entry]]
- [[Reaction to Pull]] → [[Double Leg Entry]]
- [[Grip Break]] → [[Double Leg Entry]]
- [[Collar Tie Control]] → [[Double Leg Entry]]
- [[Opponent Aggression]] → [[Double Leg Entry]]

## Follow-up Options
- [[Double leg takedown]] (primary continuation)
- [[Single Leg Transition]] (if double defense encountered)
- [[Front Headlock]] (against sprawl defense)
- [[High Crotch]] (modified continuation)
- [[Ankle Pick]] (alternative lower body attack)
- [[Knee Tap]] (if angle changes)

## Expert Insights
- **Danaher System**: Emphasizes the entry as perhaps the most critical phase of the entire takedown sequence, focusing on creating effective penetration angles before physical commitment. Considers proper level change mechanics essential, teaching specific weight distribution principles that maximize both offensive effectiveness and defensive security. Particularly emphasizes how proper head positioning serves both offensive and defensive purposes simultaneously.
- **Gordon Ryan**: Approaches double leg entries with an emphasis on timing and misdirection rather than raw athleticism. Creates strategic sequences that force defensive reactions which open entry opportunities. Particularly effective at using grip fighting exchanges to create momentary lapses in defensive posture that facilitate penetration.
- **Eddie Bravo**: While not primarily focused on traditional takedowns, has adapted double leg entries to no-gi specific scenarios, emphasizing entries that facilitate transitions to his preferred leg entanglement positions. Often employs modified entries that prioritize control over conventional completion when the goal is to initiate specific ground sequences.

## Common Errors
- Telegraphing level change → Premature defensive reaction
- Dropping head before level change → Vulnerability to sprawl/guillotine
- Inadequate penetration step → Stalled entry
- Poor timing of entry → Defensive counter opportunity
- Neglecting upper body control → Direction management issues
- Hesitation during transition → Loss of momentum advantage
- Improper weight distribution → Balance compromise during entry

## Performance Tips
- Develop seamless transition from neutral stance to penetration position
- Practice level changes without telegraphing intentions
- Focus on explosive first step that covers maximum distance
- Maintain head up until final commitment to penetration
- Coordinate hands, head, and feet in synchronized movement
- Use subtle feints to create defensive reactions that open opportunities
- Develop awareness of optimal entry timing based on opponent's movement patterns

## Training Approaches
- Shadow drilling entry mechanics with focus on form and balance
- Partner drilling with progressive resistance
- Reaction-based entry practice against defensive movement
- Entry-to-completion flow drills
- Timing development through situational sparring
- Defense recognition and counter-adjustment practice
- Filming and analyzing entry mechanics for refinement

## Developmental Progression
- **Beginner**: Basic understanding of level change and penetration step mechanics
- **Intermediate**: Integration of setups and timing with mechanical execution
- **Advanced**: Seamless adaptation of entries based on opponent reactions, with multiple contingency paths for various defensive responses

## Conceptual Relationship to Computer Science
The Double Leg Entry functions as a "pre-processing algorithm" in the BJJ state machine, creating the optimal conditions before executing the primary transition function (the takedown itself). This represents a form of "input validation and preparation," where the initial state (standing neutral) is systematically modified to create high-probability success for the subsequent state transition. Like input sanitization in programming, the entry phase handles potential error conditions (defensive postures) and transforms them into valid inputs for the main function. The technique demonstrates the principle of "separation of concerns" by isolating the setup phase from the execution phase, allowing practitioners to focus on optimizing each component independently while ensuring they interface correctly for the complete operation.
