## Transition Description
The Double Leg Entry is a fundamental takedown setup that creates the optimal positioning and angles required for executing a successful double leg takedown. Unlike the takedown itself, which focuses on the completion mechanics after contact, the entry emphasizes the critical preliminary phase where distance is closed, level is changed, and initial penetration occurs. This technique involves strategic footwork, level changes, timing, and setup maneuvers that place the practitioner in position to penetrate effectively while neutralizing the opponent's defensive reactions. A properly executed Double Leg Entry dramatically increases the success probability of the subsequent takedown by compromising the opponent's defensive posture and balance before they can establish effective counters, making it a critical skill for any practitioner seeking to develop a reliable offensive takedown game.

## Visual Execution Sequence
Detailed description for clear visualization of the transition in action:

From a standing position, you face your opponent in a neutral stance, maintaining a balanced athletic posture with your lead foot forward, knees slightly bent, and weight centered, ready to react to their movements. You initiate the entry by creating an opportunity through a subtle feint or by reacting to their forward step, dropping your level swiftly by bending your knees while keeping your spine upright and head up to avoid telegraphing your intent. As you lower your center of gravity, you step forward explosively with your lead leg, driving off your rear leg to close the distance, aligning your head, hands, and hips in a coordinated line of attack aimed at their midsection. Your penetration step is timed with their weight shift, ensuring they are momentarily off-balance as you approach, maintaining a slight angle to avoid a direct frontal collision. As you near contact, your hands are positioned to engage their legs or torso, ready to transition into the takedown phase, while your head remains up to monitor their defensive reactions. Finally, you maintain defensive awareness, prepared to adjust if they sprawl or counter, ensuring a seamless shift from entry to the penetration phase of the double leg takedown.

**Template**: "From standing, face opponent in neutral stance, balanced with lead foot forward. Create opportunity with feint or reaction, drop level with knees bent, spine upright. Step forward explosively with lead leg, drive off rear leg to close distance. Time penetration with opponent's weight shift, approach at slight angle. Position hands for leg or torso engagement, keep head up for defense. Transition seamlessly to takedown phase, ready to adjust to counters."

## Execution Steps
1. Establish proper stance with lead foot forward, knees slightly bent, and weight centered for balance and reactivity.
2. Create entry opportunity through feints, level changes, or timed reactions to opponent's movement to disrupt their defensive posture.
3. Drop level by bending knees while maintaining an upright spine and head position to avoid telegraphing intent.
4. Step forward with lead leg while driving forward with rear leg for explosive penetration to close distance effectively.
5. Align head, hands, and hips in a coordinated line of attack aimed at opponent's midsection for optimal impact.
6. Time penetration step with opponent's weight shift or movement to catch them off-balance.
7. Transition seamlessly from entry to penetration phase of the takedown, maintaining momentum.
8. Maintain defensive awareness throughout to counter potential sprawls or other defenses, ready to adapt as needed.

## Key Details

## Common Counters and Counter-Attacks
Analysis of opponent responses with success rates for counter-attacks:
- [[Defensive Posture]] → [[Penetration Difficulty]] (Success Rate: 50%, Conditions: opponent maintains strong base to resist entry)
- [[Sprawl Defense]] → [[Entry Shutdown]] (Success Rate: 60%, Conditions: opponent sprawls hips back to counter penetration)
- [[Head Position Counter]] → [[Directional Control Loss]] (Success Rate: 45%, Conditions: opponent pushes head down to disrupt alignment)
- [[Distance Control]] → [[Entry Timing Disruption]] (Success Rate: 40%, Conditions: opponent steps back to maintain distance)
- [[Underhook Defense]] → [[Angle Restriction]] (Success Rate: 55%, Conditions: opponent secures underhooks to block entry angle)
- [[Submission Counter]] → [[Guillotine Opportunity]] (Success Rate: 35%, Conditions: opponent capitalizes on lowered head for choke)

## Decision Logic for Opponent Behavior
```
If [opponent weight] shifts forward or during movement:
- Execute [[Double Leg Entry]] (Probability: 75%)

Else if [opponent posture] is defensively strong:
- Attempt [[Feint or Setup]] to create opening (Probability: 50%)

Else if [opponent distance] is maintained with steps back:
- Use [[Footwork Feint]] to close distance (Probability: 45%)

Else if [opponent sprawl] is initiated early:
- Adjust to [[Single Leg Transition]] (Probability: 60%)

Else [maintain control]:
- Reset stance and wait for better timing (Probability: 40%)
```

## Variants
- Standard Double Leg Entry (basic level change and penetration)
- Feint Entry (using fake attacks to create openings)
- Reaction-based Entry (capitalizing on opponent's movements)
- Tie-up Entry (entering from collar tie or other grip)
- Angle Entry (attacking at an oblique angle rather than head-on)
- Combination Entry (following failed takedown attempt for chain attack)

## Expert Insights
- **John Danaher**: "The Double Leg Entry is perhaps the most critical phase of the entire takedown sequence, focusing on creating effective penetration angles before physical commitment. Proper level change mechanics are essential, with specific weight distribution principles that maximize both offensive effectiveness and defensive security. I particularly emphasize how proper head positioning serves both offensive and defensive purposes simultaneously, ensuring you remain safe while attacking."
- **Gordon Ryan**: "I approach Double Leg Entries with an emphasis on timing and misdirection rather than raw athleticism. Creating strategic sequences that force defensive reactions opens entry opportunities. I'm particularly effective at using grip fighting exchanges to create momentary lapses in defensive posture that facilitate penetration, turning a simple entry into a high-percentage attack."
- **Eddie Bravo**: "While not primarily focused on traditional takedowns, I've adapted Double Leg Entries to no-gi specific scenarios, emphasizing entries that facilitate transitions to my preferred leg entanglement positions. I often employ modified entries that prioritize control over conventional completion when the goal is to initiate specific ground sequences. Timing and angle are everything in making this work without the gi."

## Common Errors

  - **Why It Fails**: Gives opponent time to react with defensive posture or sprawl
  - **Correction**: Drop level swiftly without excessive upper body movement
  - **Recognition**: Opponent steps back or prepares sprawl before penetration
- **Error**: Dropping head before level change
  - **Why It Fails**: Exposes neck to guillotine or head control counters
  - **Correction**: Keep head up until penetration step, aligning after level drop
  - **Recognition**: Opponent grabs head or neck during entry attempt
- **Error**: Inadequate penetration step
  - **Why It Fails**: Fails to close distance effectively, leaving entry stalled
  - **Correction**: Drive off rear leg explosively for maximum distance coverage
  - **Recognition**: Gap remains between you and opponent after step
- **Error**: Poor timing of entry

## Historical Context
The Double Leg Entry has roots in freestyle and folkstyle wrestling, adapted into Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu for its effectiveness in controlling an opponent's position from standing. It became a staple in BJJ through cross-training with wrestlers and the emphasis on takedowns in competitive formats like IBJJF and ADCC. The technique showcases BJJ's evolution as a hybrid martial art, integrating wrestling principles with ground control strategies. Its prominence grew with practitioners like Rodolfo Vieira and Gordon Ryan, who demonstrated its value in high-level competition.

## Conceptual Framework
The Double Leg Entry embodies core BJJ and wrestling principles of control, timing, and energy efficiency. It leverages level changes and penetration to disrupt an opponent's balance before contact, creating a high-probability setup for the takedown. The technique illustrates how strategic positioning and timing can overcome physical disparities, making it accessible to practitioners of varying builds and strengths. It serves as a foundational element in a comprehensive standing game.

## Computer Science Analogy
The Double Leg Entry functions as a "pre-processing algorithm" in the BJJ state machine, creating the optimal conditions before executing the primary transition function (the takedown itself). This represents a form of "input validation and preparation," where the initial state (standing neutral) is systematically modified to create high-probability success for the subsequent state transition. Like input sanitization in programming, the entry phase handles potential error conditions (defensive postures) and transforms them into valid inputs for the main function. The technique demonstrates the principle of "separation of concerns" by isolating the setup phase from the execution phase, allowing practitioners to focus on optimizing each component independently while ensuring they interface correctly for the complete operation.
