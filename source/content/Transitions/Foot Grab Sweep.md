## State Machine Content Elements

### Visual Execution Sequence
Detailed step-by-step description for clear movement sequence visualization:

From a Half Guard Bottom position, you start on your side with one of the opponent's legs trapped between yours, facing them as they attempt to control your upper body or pass your guard, with your inside arm securing an underhook on their far side to prevent being flattened, while your outside arm frames against their shoulder or neck to maintain space, and your legs are positioned with one knee up as a shield and the other hooking their trapped leg, ready to initiate the sweep. You maintain a strong connection with your underhook, keeping your elbow tight to your body to control their posture, while your head is positioned defensively to avoid crossfaces, ensuring your hips are mobile and slightly turned towards the trapped leg side to prepare for the movement, as you reach down with your outside hand to grab the foot or ankle of their trapped leg, pulling it towards you to disrupt their base. As you initiate the sweep, you use your underhook to pull yourself up and towards their back while simultaneously pulling their foot closer to further off-balance them, shifting your hips underneath their center of gravity to create leverage, using your knee shield to push against their chest or shoulder to assist in elevating them, while your hooking leg tightens to control their trapped leg and prevent them from stepping out. With the opponent off-balanced and their foot controlled, you continue the motion by driving your hips upward and rolling them over their trapped leg side, using your underhook to guide their upper body down to the mat, maintaining control of their foot and leg as they fall to their back or side, ensuring you follow through by coming up on top, often landing in a dominant position like side control or a high half guard if their defenses are still active. You consolidate the position by securing an underhook or crossface to prevent their immediate escape, having successfully reversed the position from bottom half guard to top dominance through a precise foot grab sweep.

**Template**: "From Half Guard Bottom, trap opponent's leg, secure underhook on far side, frame with outside arm. Maintain tight underhook, keep hips mobile, grab trapped leg's foot/ankle to disrupt base. Use underhook to pull up, pull foot closer, shift hips underneath, push with knee shield for elevation. Drive hips up, roll opponent over trapped leg side, follow to top position or side control. Consolidate with underhook/crossface to secure dominance."

### Execution Steps (Numbered Sequence)
1. **Setup Requirements**: Start in Half Guard Bottom with opponent's leg trapped
2. **Control Establishment**: Secure underhook on far side, frame with outside arm
3. **Posture Defense**: Maintain tight underhook, keep hips turned for mobility
4. **Foot Grab**: Reach with outside hand to grab foot/ankle of trapped leg
5. **Base Disruption**: Pull foot towards you to off-balance opponent's stance
6. **Hip Preparation**: Shift hips underneath opponent's center of gravity for leverage
7. **Elevation Action**: Push with knee shield against chest/shoulder, tighten hook on leg
8. **Hip Drive**: Drive hips upward, use underhook to guide opponent down
9. **Sweep Completion**: Roll opponent over trapped leg side, maintain foot/leg control
10. **Position Consolidation**: Follow through to top position, secure underhook/crossface

### Key Technical Details
Critical elements that determine success:
- **Foot Control**: Secure grip on opponent's foot/ankle to disrupt their base
- **Underhook Leverage**: Strong underhook to control upper body and pull towards back
- **Hip Positioning**: Shifting hips underneath opponent for optimal sweep leverage
- **Knee Shield Push**: Using knee to elevate and create space for the roll
- **Follow-Through**: Continuous motion to come up on top after sweep

### Success Modifiers
Factors that increase/decrease probability:
- **Foot Grip**: Effectiveness of controlling opponent's foot/ankle (+/-20%)
- **Opponent Balance**: Degree of base disruption or forward lean (+/-15%)
- **Hip Mobility**: Ability to shift and drive hips dynamically (+/-15%)
- **Underhook Strength**: Control over opponent's upper body (+/-10%)
- **Knowledge Test Performance**: Understanding half guard sweep mechanics (+/-10%)

## Counter-Attack Analysis

### Common Counters
Opponent responses with success rates:
- **Base Recovery**: Stepping out with trapped leg to regain balance → [[Top Half Guard]] (Success Rate: 40%, Conditions: early recognition)
- **Foot Freeing**: Pulling foot free from grip control → [[Neutral Position]] (Success Rate: 30%, Conditions: strong grip break)
- **Upper Body Control**: Using crossface or whizzer to resist roll → [[Top Position]] (Success Rate: 20%, Conditions: quick reaction)
- **Counter Sweep**: Using sweep momentum for own attack → [[Top Position]] (Success Rate: 10%, Conditions: advanced skill)

Format: `[[Counter Technique]] → [[Result State]] (Success Rate: X%, Conditions: [when applicable])`

### Decision Logic
```
If [sweep setup] is recognized early:
- Execute [[Base Recovery]] (Probability: 40%)

Else if [grip break] can free trapped foot:
- Attempt [[Foot Freeing]] (Probability: 30%)

Else if [upper body control] can resist roll:
- Execute [[Upper Body Control]] (Probability: 20%)

Else [advanced skill] allows counter attack:
- Attempt [[Counter Sweep]] (Probability: 10%)

Else [optimal execution]:
- Accept transition (Probability: Success Rate - Modifiers)
```

## Educational Content

### Expert Insights
Commentary as if from recognized authorities:
- **John Danaher**: "The Foot Grab Sweep from half guard is a technique that exemplifies the principle of disrupting an opponent's base at the lowest point to create sweeping opportunities. The key is in controlling the foot to undermine their stability while using the underhook to dominate their upper body, demonstrating how small control points can lead to major reversals. This sweep teaches critical principles of base manipulation and leverage that are essential for advanced half guard systems."
- **Gordon Ryan**: "In competition, the Foot Grab Sweep is a reliable move from half guard, especially against opponents who focus on upper body control. I focus on securing the foot grip and driving through the hip shift to ensure they roll over cleanly. This technique shows how half guard sweeps can be adapted into dominant attacks from the bottom with precise control."
- **Eddie Bravo**: "Foot Grab Sweep is a slick half guard sweep that blends classic control with modern dynamics, offering a solid way to reverse position. It’s a great move for grapplers who like to attack the base and create dynamic sweeps, often chaining into other attacks. This sweep integrates well with systems that prioritize fluid transitions and off-balancing from half guard."

Each insight should focus on one key technical or strategic element.

### Common Errors
For knowledge test generation:
- **Error**: Ineffective foot grip or control
- **Why It Fails**: Lacks disruption of opponent's base, allowing them to maintain balance
- **Correction**: Secure strong grip on foot/ankle, pull towards you to off-balance
- **Recognition**: Opponent easily steps out or maintains stable base

- **Error**: Poor hip positioning or insufficient shift
- **Why It Fails**: Reduces leverage for sweep, making roll difficult
- **Correction**: Shift hips significantly underneath opponent's center of gravity
- **Recognition**: Sweep stalls or opponent resists with base

- **Error**: Weak underhook or lack of upper body control
- **Why It Fails**: Allows opponent to control your upper body, countering the sweep
- **Correction**: Maintain tight underhook, pull towards their back for leverage
- **Recognition**: Opponent crossfaces or whizzers to resist roll

### Timing Considerations
When to attempt this transition:
- **Optimal Conditions**: When opponent focuses on upper body control, neglecting base
- **Avoid When**: Opponent maintains low, wide base with strong posture
- **Setup Sequences**: After establishing underhook and framing in half guard
- **Follow-up Windows**: Must complete sweep within 3-5 seconds to avoid counters

### Prerequisites
Requirements before attempting:
- **Technical Skills**: Understanding of half guard principles and sweep mechanics
- **Physical Preparation**: Hip mobility and grip strength for control
- **Positional Understanding**: Control points in half guard and base disruption
- **Experience Level**: Intermediate - requires timing and control in half guard
