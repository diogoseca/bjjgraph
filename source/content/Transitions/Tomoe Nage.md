## State Machine Content Elements

### Visual Execution Sequence
Detailed step-by-step description for clear movement sequence visualization:

From a Standing Position or Clinch Position, you begin facing the opponent with a strong grip, typically a collar and sleeve grip or over-under control, maintaining an upright posture to control their upper body and set up the takedown, while keeping your feet shoulder-width apart for a stable base. You initiate the attack by pulling the opponent forward with your grips, breaking their posture and forcing them to step or lean toward you, as you step back slightly with one foot to create space and angle your body for the throw, ensuring your pulling action keeps their weight shifting over their front foot. As they commit their weight forward, you place your dominant foot (often the same side as your sleeve grip) on their lower abdomen or hip, with your toes pointing up to create a pivot point, while simultaneously sitting back and down into a controlled sacrifice fall, rolling onto your back and pulling them over you with both arms, using your core to guide their momentum. With your foot acting as a fulcrum, you extend your leg powerfully to lift and flip the opponent over your head, maintaining grip control to direct their fall, as your other leg bends or posts on the mat to assist in the rotation and prevent them from landing directly on you. You follow through by rolling with the momentum, either coming up on top if the throw lands them on their back, securing a top position like side control or mount, or transitioning into a guard position if they manage to turn mid-air, ready to attack or defend as the situation dictates.

**Template**: "From Standing or Clinch Position, secure collar and sleeve or over-under grip, maintain upright posture. Pull opponent forward to break posture, step back to create space and angle. Place dominant foot on lower abdomen or hip, sit back into sacrifice fall, pull them over. Extend leg to lift and flip opponent over head, control fall with grips. Roll with momentum to top position or transition to guard based on landing."

### Execution Steps (Numbered Sequence)
1. **Setup Requirements**: Start in Standing or Clinch Position with strong grip control
2. **Grip Establishment**: Secure collar and sleeve or over-under grip for upper body control
3. **Posture Break**: Pull opponent forward to disrupt balance, force weight onto front foot
4. **Positioning Step**: Step back with one foot to create space and angle for throw
5. **Foot Placement**: Place dominant foot on opponent's lower abdomen or hip as pivot
6. **Sacrifice Fall**: Sit back and down, rolling onto back in controlled fall
7. **Pulling Action**: Pull opponent over with both arms, guide momentum with core
8. **Leg Extension**: Extend pivot leg to lift and flip opponent over your head
9. **Throw Completion**: Direct opponent's fall with grips, roll with momentum
10. **Position Outcome**: Land in top position (side control/mount) or transition to guard

### Key Technical Details
Critical elements that determine success:
- **Grip Control**: Strong pulling grips to break opponent's posture and guide throw
- **Foot Placement**: Accurate positioning of foot on abdomen/hip as pivot point
- **Sacrifice Timing**: Controlled fall to back at precise moment of opponent's imbalance
- **Leg Power**: Explosive extension of pivot leg to lift and flip opponent
- **Momentum Management**: Rolling with throw to secure advantageous landing position

### Success Modifiers
Factors that increase/decrease probability:
- **Grip Strength**: Effectiveness of collar/sleeve control for pulling (+/-20%)
- **Opponent Posture**: Degree of forward lean or imbalance (+/-15%)
- **Timing Precision**: Coordination of pull and sacrifice fall (+/-15%)
- **Foot Placement Accuracy**: Correct positioning on abdomen/hip (+/-10%)
- **Knowledge Test Performance**: Understanding sacrifice throw mechanics (+/-10%)

## Counter-Attack Analysis

### Common Counters
Opponent responses with success rates:
- **Posture Recovery**: Stepping back to regain balance → [[Standing Position]] (Success Rate: 45%, Conditions: early recognition)
- **Base Widening**: Lowering center of gravity to resist pull → [[Clinch Position]] (Success Rate: 35%, Conditions: quick reaction)
- **Counter Throw**: Using attacker's fall for own takedown → [[Top Position]] (Success Rate: 25%, Conditions: advanced skill)
- **Guard Pull Defense**: Falling into guard to avoid full throw → [[Guard Position]] (Success Rate: 20%, Conditions: defensive mindset)

Format: `[[Counter Technique]] → [[Result State]] (Success Rate: X%, Conditions: [when applicable])`

### Decision Logic
```
If [throw setup] is recognized early:
- Execute [[Posture Recovery]] (Probability: 45%)

Else if [center of gravity] can be lowered quickly:
- Execute [[Base Widening]] (Probability: 35%)

Else if [skill level] allows counter attack:
- Attempt [[Counter Throw]] (Probability: 25%)

Else [defensive mindset] prioritizes position:
- Attempt [[Guard Pull Defense]] (Probability: 20%)

Else [optimal execution]:
- Accept transition (Probability: Success Rate - Modifiers)
```

## Educational Content

### Expert Insights
Commentary as if from recognized authorities:
- **John Danaher**: "Tomoe Nage is a classic judo sacrifice throw that exemplifies the principle of using an opponent's momentum against them. The key is in the precise timing of the sacrifice fall and the foot placement to create a pivot for the throw, demonstrating how strategic yielding can lead to dominance. This technique teaches critical principles of balance manipulation that are essential for advanced takedown systems."
- **Gordon Ryan**: "In competition, Tomoe Nage can be a high-risk, high-reward move, especially against opponents who overcommit forward. I focus on pulling them into the throw with strong grips and rolling with the momentum to secure top control. This throw shows how judo techniques can be adapted into BJJ for dynamic stand-up game."
- **Eddie Bravo**: "Tomoe Nage is a slick sacrifice throw that blends judo with BJJ's ground focus, offering a way to transition from standing to ground with control. It’s a great move for grapplers who like to surprise opponents with unorthodox takedowns, often leading directly into guard attacks. This technique integrates well with systems that prioritize fluid transitions from standing to ground."

Each insight should focus on one key technical or strategic element.

### Common Errors
For knowledge test generation:
- **Error**: Poor grip control or insufficient posture break
- **Why It Fails**: Lacks leverage to pull opponent forward into throw
- **Correction**: Secure strong collar/sleeve grip and pull to disrupt balance
- **Recognition**: Opponent remains upright or easily steps back

- **Error**: Incorrect foot placement on opponent's body
- **Why It Fails**: Reduces pivot effectiveness, making throw difficult or dangerous
- **Correction**: Place foot accurately on lower abdomen or hip with toes up
- **Recognition**: Throw stalls or foot slips during leg extension

- **Error**: Mistimed sacrifice fall or lack of commitment
- **Why It Fails**: Loses momentum or leaves attacker vulnerable on back
- **Correction**: Commit to controlled fall as opponent leans forward
- **Recognition**: Opponent counters with posture recovery or top pressure

### Timing Considerations
When to attempt this transition:
- **Optimal Conditions**: When opponent overcommits forward or leans heavily
- **Avoid When**: Opponent maintains low, defensive posture with strong base
- **Setup Sequences**: After establishing strong pulling grips to break posture
- **Follow-up Windows**: Must complete throw within 2-3 seconds to avoid counters
