# 50-50 Pass
#bjj #transition #guard-pass #leg-entanglement #advanced

## Visual Execution Sequence

From 50-50 guard top position, both legs are entangled with your right leg trapped inside their legs and your left leg controlling over their right leg. Your opponent controls your trapped leg and threatens heel hooks or transitions. You clear your hips back while posting your free hand for base, creating space to extract your trapped leg. As you pull your knee up and out of their leg triangle, you maintain downward pressure on their top leg to prevent them following. Once your leg clears, you immediately backstep away from their guard while maintaining top pressure and controlling their legs. You circle to a superior position such as headquarters or ashi garami top, or continue backing away to standing to fully disengage from the leg entanglement safely.

**One-Sentence Summary**: "From 50-50 guard top, you clear your hips back and extract your trapped leg while preventing their follow-up, backing out to superior top position."

## Execution Steps

1. **Setup Requirements**: Recognize 50-50 position with your leg trapped, control opponent's top leg, establish hand posts for stability
2. **Initial Movement**: Clear your hips backward away from opponent while maintaining downward pressure on their legs
3. **Opponent Response**: Opponent typically attempts to maintain leg triangle control, threatens heel hooks, or tries to follow your hips
4. **Adaptation**: Pull your trapped knee up and toward yourself while pressing down on their top leg to create extraction space
5. **Completion**: Extract your leg completely from their triangle while backstepping away from their guard
6. **Consolidation**: Circle to headquarters position, ashi garami top, or standing position with control maintained and leg entanglement cleared

## Key Technical Details

- **Grip Requirements**: Control opponent's top leg with your hand, establish posts for base stability during extraction
- **Base/Foundation**: Wide base with free leg posted, hips mobile and ready to clear backward quickly
- **Timing Windows**: Extract when opponent's leg triangle control weakens or during their transition attempts
- **Leverage Points**: Downward pressure on their top leg combined with pulling your knee up creates extraction space
- **Common Adjustments**: If they maintain tight control, rock your hips side-to-side to create looseness before extraction

## Common Counters

Opponent defensive responses with success rates and conditions:

- **[[Inside Heel Hook]]** → [[Won by Submission]] (Success Rate: 55%, Conditions: catches leg during extraction and secures heel hook before escape)
- **[[Leg Triangle Maintenance]]** → [[50-50 Guard Bottom]] (Success Rate: 45%, Conditions: maintains tight triangle and follows your hips as you attempt to clear)
- **[[Backside 50-50 Transition]]** → [[Backside 50-50]] (Success Rate: 50%, Conditions: inverts as you extract and establishes backside position)
- **[[Outside Ashi Transition]]** → [[Outside Ashi Garami Bottom]] (Success Rate: 40%, Conditions: releases triangle and captures your leg in different entanglement)

### Decision Logic for AI Opponent

```
If [leg extraction telegraphed early]:
- Execute [[Inside Heel Hook]] (Probability: 55%)

Else if [triangle control strong]:
- Maintain [[Leg Triangle]] and follow hips (Probability: 45%)

Else if [extraction committed and space created]:
- Execute [[Backside 50-50 Transition]] (Probability: 50%)

Else [optimal extraction conditions]:
- Accept transition (Probability: Base Success Rate + Applied Modifiers)
```

## Expert Insights

### John Danaher
"The 50-50 position is one of the most complex leg entanglements in modern jiu-jitsu. The pass from top 50-50 requires understanding that both practitioners have similar control over each other's legs - the position is symmetrical with slight advantages to whoever establishes superior control first. The key to passing is creating enough space to extract your trapped leg while simultaneously preventing your opponent from improving their position. This requires hip mobility, precise timing, and constant awareness of heel hook threats during the extraction."

### Gordon Ryan
"In competition, I view top 50-50 as a position to either attack leg locks from or escape quickly. If I'm passing, I focus on controlling their top leg and clearing my hips back aggressively. The biggest mistake people make is being tentative - you need to commit to the extraction once you start. Half-committed extraction attempts are when you get caught in heel hooks. I also watch for them inverting to backside 50-50, which is actually more dangerous for leg locks. If I feel that transition coming, I might abandon the pass and stand up completely to disengage safely."

### Eddie Bravo
"The 50-50 is a staple in modern leg lock systems, but in 10th Planet we teach specific counters and escapes. When passing from top 50-50, you need to be aware they can hit you with leg locks just as easily during your escape. The key is controlling their movement - if they can invert or follow your hips, you're still in danger. We emphasize the backstep motion combined with leg pressure to prevent their hips from following. Some students prefer to stand completely and disengage rather than staying in close range during the pass. Safety first, especially with heel hooks involved."

## Common Errors

### Error 1: Attempting extraction without clearing hips back first
- **Why It Fails**: Keeps you in range of leg locks and allows opponent to maintain tight triangle control
- **Correction**: Clear hips backward significantly before attempting to pull knee out of triangle
- **Recognition**: Getting caught in heel hooks or unable to create space for extraction

### Error 2: Not controlling opponent's top leg during extraction
- **Why It Fails**: Allows opponent to follow your hips and maintain entanglement or transition to other positions
- **Correction**: Maintain downward pressure on their top leg throughout entire extraction sequence
- **Recognition**: Opponent easily follows your movement and maintains guard or improves position

### Error 3: Pulling trapped leg straight back instead of up and out
- **Why It Fails**: Doesn't create the necessary angle to clear the triangle, potentially increases heel hook danger
- **Correction**: Pull knee up toward your chest first, then extract outward from triangle
- **Recognition**: Leg feels stuck in triangle or extraction creates dangerous heel hook exposure

### Error 4: Being tentative or stopping mid-extraction
- **Why It Fails**: Half-committed extraction is most dangerous moment for heel hooks and position loss
- **Correction**: Once you commit to extraction, complete it fully and quickly with decisive movement
- **Recognition**: Getting caught in submissions during slow or hesitant extraction attempts

### Error 5: Not backstepping away after leg clears
- **Why It Fails**: Remaining in close range allows opponent to re-engage with different leg entanglements
- **Correction**: Immediately backstep in large circular motion away from their guard after extraction
- **Recognition**: Getting immediately re-entangled in ashi garami or other leg locks after clearing 50-50

## Timing Considerations

- **Optimal Conditions**: When opponent's triangle control loosens, during their transition attempts, or when they're fatigued
- **Avoid When**: Opponent has extremely tight triangle with active heel hook threats, or when your trapped leg is deeply controlled
- **Setup Sequences**: After defending heel hook attempt creates space, or after opponent fails transition to backside 50-50
- **Follow-up Windows**: Must complete backstep and circling motion within 2-3 seconds to prevent re-entanglement

## Prerequisites

- **Technical Skills**: Understanding of 50-50 mechanics, leg entanglement concepts, heel hook defense, hip mobility
- **Physical Preparation**: Hip flexibility for extraction, core strength for hip clearing, leg strength for pressure maintenance
- **Positional Understanding**: Leg lock positions hierarchy, 50-50 dangers and escapes, ashi garami positions
- **Experience Level**: Advanced - requires extensive knowledge of leg entanglements and submission defense

## Knowledge Assessment

1. **Mechanical Understanding**: "What creates the space needed to extract your leg from 50-50?"
   - A) Pulling your leg straight back with force
   - B) Standing up immediately
   - C) Clearing your hips backward while pulling knee up and pressing their top leg down
   - D) Rolling to your back
   - **Answer**: C

2. **Timing Recognition**: "When is the optimal moment to attempt extraction from 50-50?"
   - A) When opponent has tight triangle and active heel hook threat
   - B) When opponent's triangle control loosens or during their transition attempt
   - C) Immediately upon entering 50-50
   - D) When you are fatigued
   - **Answer**: B

3. **Error Prevention**: "What is the most dangerous mistake during 50-50 extraction?"
   - A) Extracting too quickly
   - B) Being tentative or stopping mid-extraction
   - C) Controlling their top leg too much
   - D) Clearing hips too far back
   - **Answer**: B

4. **Setup Requirements**: "Which control is essential during the extraction?"
   - A) Grabbing their ankle
   - B) Controlling their gi collar
   - C) Maintaining downward pressure on their top leg
   - D) Grabbing both their legs
   - **Answer**: C

5. **Adaptation**: "How should you adjust if opponent follows your hips during extraction?"
   - A) Stop and reset to 50-50
   - B) Increase downward pressure on their top leg and accelerate backstep motion
   - C) Roll to your back
   - D) Go for your own leg lock
   - **Answer**: B

## Variants and Adaptations

- **Gi Specific**: Use gi grips on their pants to control legs during extraction, collar grips can assist with pressure
- **No-Gi Specific**: Rely more on leg pressure and hip position since grip control limited, requires faster extraction
- **Self-Defense**: Standing extraction preferred for street scenarios to fully disengage and create distance
- **Competition**: Risk-reward assessment critical - sometimes maintaining 50-50 safer than risky extraction under submission-only rules
- **Size Differential**: Smaller practitioners may find extraction easier due to mobility advantage, larger practitioners use strength for pressure

## Training Progressions

1. **Solo Practice**: Hip clearing motion and leg extraction angles without partner, mobility development
2. **Cooperative Drilling**: Partner maintains light triangle while you practice extraction sequence and timing
3. **Resistant Practice**: Partner progressively defends extraction and threatens submissions as you develop safety awareness
4. **Sparring Integration**: Practice extraction during live rolling from 50-50, recognize optimal windows and danger signs
5. **Troubleshooting**: Identify common failures - usually insufficient hip clearing or poor leg pressure control

## Competition Applications

- **IBJJF Rules**: Legal at brown and black belt in gi, legal at all belts in no-gi, critical for modern competition game
- **No-Gi Competition**: Essential skill for leg lock heavy rule sets like EBI, ADCC, submission-only
- **Self-Defense**: Standing extraction preferred to fully disengage and create distance from ground entanglement
- **MMA Applications**: Modified standing extraction essential for MMA to avoid ground entanglement and enable striking

## Historical Context

The 50-50 guard position gained prominence in modern jiu-jitsu through the work of practitioners like Ryan Hall and the Danaher Death Squad. As leg lock systems evolved, the 50-50 became recognized as both a powerful attacking position and a complex entanglement requiring sophisticated escape and passing techniques. The modern 50-50 pass emphasizes safety awareness of heel hook threats during extraction, reflecting the evolution of leg lock knowledge in sport BJJ.

## Safety Considerations

- **Controlled Application**: Deliberate extraction motion prevents knee and ankle injuries for both practitioners
- **Mat Awareness**: Ensure adequate space for backstep motion and emergency disengagement if needed
- **Partner Safety**: Communicate about leg lock threats during training, tap early to heel hooks
- **Gradual Progression**: Build up extraction speed and pressure gradually, develop safety awareness before live training

## Position Integration

**Common combinations and sequences:**
- [[50-50 Guard Top]] → [[50-50 Pass]] → [[Headquarters Position]]
- [[50-50 Guard Top]] → [[50-50 Pass]] → [[Standing Position]] (full disengagement)
- [[50-50 Guard Top]] → [[50-50 Pass]] → [[Ashi Garami Top]] (if they transition during extraction)
