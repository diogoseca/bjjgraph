- **Speed Requirements**: High for quick execution before defensive reaction

## State Machine Content Elements

### Visual Execution Sequence
From turtle top position with your opponent in defensive turtle, you establish chest pressure while controlling their near-side arm. You thread your far-side arm under their neck toward the near shoulder, maintaining palm-down orientation. As your arm slides deep, their near arm becomes trapped between your choking arm and their neck. You secure the figure-four grip by grasping your own bicep. Rolling to your side or onto your back, you pull opponent with you, establishing optimal choking angle. Squeezing your bicep while engaging back muscles creates the anaconda choke pressure, controlling opponent in the anaconda control position.

**Template**: "From turtle top with near arm control, thread your far arm under the neck palm-down, trap their near arm, lock figure-four grip, roll to side bringing opponent with you, and squeeze to establish anaconda choke control."

### Execution Steps (Numbered Sequence)
1. **Establish Position**: Secure turtle top with chest pressure, control opponent's near-side arm with your hand
2. **Arm Threading**: Thread your far-side arm under opponent's neck toward their near shoulder, palm down position
3. **Trap Near Arm**: Ensure opponent's near arm is trapped between your choking arm and their neck - critical element
4. **Lock Grip**: Secure figure-four grip by grabbing your own bicep with opposite hand, eliminating space
5. **Roll to Side**: Roll to your side or onto your back, bringing opponent with you for optimal pressure angle
6. **Apply Pressure**: Squeeze with bicep and engage lat muscles to create anaconda choke compression

### Key Technical Details
Critical elements that determine success:
- **Grip Requirements**: Figure-four with palm-down threading arm, tight bicep grip
- **Base/Foundation**: Rolling motion transitions from top pressure to side control angle
- **Timing Windows**: Execute when near arm is accessible for trap and opponent has not anticipated roll
- **Leverage Points**: Bicep squeezes neck while trapped arm creates pressure point
- **Common Adjustments**: Adjust rolling direction, walk body around for tighter squeeze angle

### Success Modifiers
Factors that increase/decrease probability:
- **Setup Quality**: Near arm trap security and threading depth (+/-15%)
- **Timing Precision**: Rolling before opponent can counter-roll or escape (+/-15%)
- **Opponent Fatigue**: Reduced ability to defend roll and maintain base (+/-5%)
- **Knowledge Test Performance**: Understanding anaconda mechanics and roll timing (+/-10%)
- **Position Control**: Quality of initial turtle top dominance and chest pressure (+/-5%)

## Counter-Attack Analysis

### Common Counters
Opponent responses with success rates:
- **Pull Arm In**: Retracting near arm before trap secured → [[Turtle Position]] (Success Rate: 50%, Conditions: early recognition)
- **Base Out**: Posting with free arm to prevent roll → [[Turtle Top]] (Success Rate: 45%, Conditions: strong base)
- **Counter Roll**: Rolling opposite direction to escape → [[Scramble Position]] (Success Rate: 35%, Conditions: timing and awareness)
- **Stand Up**: Explosive standing to create space → [[Front Headlock Defense]] (Success Rate: 30%, Conditions: before roll initiated)

Format: `[[Counter Technique]] → [[Result State]] (Success Rate: X%, Conditions: [when applicable])`

### Decision Logic
```
If [near arm not trapped]:
- Execute [[Pull Arm In]] (Probability: 50%)

Else if [roll initiation detected]:
- Execute [[Base Out]] (Probability: 45%)

Else if [can counter-roll]:
- Execute [[Counter Roll]] (Probability: 35%)

Else [anaconda locked and rolled]:
- Accept transition (Probability: Success Rate - Modifiers)
```

## Educational Content

### Expert Insights
Commentary as if from recognized authorities:
- **John Danaher**: "The anaconda from turtle is technically similar to the D'arce but requires an additional element of rolling to secure the optimal finishing angle. The critical distinction is that you trap the near arm rather than the far arm, and the finish typically involves rolling to your side or back rather than staying on top. Thread your arm deep with palm down, ensuring the near arm is trapped. The rolling motion is not just a finishing detail - it's essential for creating the proper choking angle. Your bicep must compress one side while their own trapped arm and shoulder compress the other carotid artery."
- **Gordon Ryan**: "The anaconda from turtle is one of my favorite techniques because it's unexpected and the roll momentum often secures the finish before they can defend properly. The key is committing to the roll once you have the grip - hesitation gives them time to base out. I thread the arm, lock the grip, and immediately roll to my side. Even if the choke doesn't finish right away, I've usually secured top position with a dominant control. It's a high-reward technique when executed with speed and confidence."
- **Eddie Bravo**: "We use the anaconda constantly in our system, especially from turtle and during scrambles. The beautiful thing about the anaconda is the roll - it's dynamic, it's aggressive, and opponents don't see it coming. Once you get comfortable with that gator roll motion, you can hit anacondas from all kinds of positions. From turtle it's especially good because they're already in a compromised position. Thread deep, trap that near arm, and roll hard. The momentum does half the work for you."

Each insight should focus on one key technical or strategic element.

### Common Errors
For knowledge test generation:
- **Error**: Trapping far arm instead of near arm
- **Why It Fails**: Changes technique to D'arce instead of anaconda, requires different finishing angle
- **Correction**: Identify which arm is closest to you and trap that one for anaconda mechanics
- **Recognition**: Cannot generate effective pressure even with correct roll

- **Error**: Hesitating or delaying the roll after securing grip
- **Why It Fails**: Gives opponent time to base out and prevent roll completion
- **Correction**: Commit immediately to roll once figure-four grip is locked
- **Recognition**: Opponent successfully bases out and maintains turtle position

- **Error**: Rolling in wrong direction or insufficient roll momentum
- **Why It Fails**: Incorrect angle prevents proper carotid compression
- **Correction**: Roll decisively to the side that brings opponent over trapped arm
- **Recognition**: Technique feels weak despite proper arm trap and grip

- **Error**: Not maintaining tight grip during roll transition
- **Why It Fails**: Loose grip allows opponent to create space and escape during motion
- **Correction**: Lock figure-four extremely tight before initiating roll
- **Recognition**: Opponent escapes during rolling motion

- **Error**: Threading arm too shallow, not reaching past near shoulder
- **Why It Fails**: Insufficient arm depth means choking position is not achieved
- **Correction**: Drive arm deep until wrist clears opponent's near shoulder
- **Recognition**: Cannot secure proper squeeze even after rolling

### Timing Considerations
When to attempt this transition:
- **Optimal Conditions**: Opponent's near arm is accessible, turtle posture allows arm trap
- **Avoid When**: Opponent has extremely strong base with arms protected tight
- **Setup Sequences**: After opponent turtles from back defense or during scramble transitions
- **Follow-up Windows**: Must trap arm and initiate roll within 3-4 seconds

### Prerequisites
Requirements before attempting:
- **Technical Skills**: Understanding of anaconda mechanics, rolling coordination, arm trapping
- **Physical Preparation**: Upper body strength for roll, grip endurance for sustained pressure
- **Positional Understanding**: Turtle top control, front headlock principles, rolling techniques
- **Experience Level**: Advanced technique requiring precise timing and confidence in rolling
