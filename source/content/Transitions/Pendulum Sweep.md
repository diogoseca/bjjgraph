### Visual Execution Sequence
Detailed step-by-step description for clear movement sequence visualization:

From a Half Guard Bottom position, you start on your side with one of the opponent's legs trapped between yours, facing them as they attempt to control your upper body or pass your guard, with your inside arm securing an underhook on their far side to prevent being flattened, while your outside arm frames against their shoulder or neck to maintain space, and your legs are positioned with one knee up as a shield and the other hooking their trapped leg, ready to initiate the sweep. You maintain a strong connection with your underhook, keeping your elbow tight to your body to control their posture, while your head is positioned defensively to avoid crossfaces, ensuring your hips are mobile and slightly turned towards the trapped leg side to prepare for the movement, as you adjust your outside leg to swing it back and prepare for a pendulum motion, using your outside hand to control their arm or wrist on the same side to limit their ability to post. As you initiate the sweep, you use your underhook to pull yourself up and towards their back while simultaneously swinging your outside leg back and then forward in a pendulum motion to build momentum, shifting your hips underneath their center of gravity to create leverage, using your knee shield to push against their chest or shoulder to assist in elevating them, while your hooking leg tightens to control their trapped leg and prevent them from stepping out. With the opponent off-balanced by the pendulum swing of your leg, you continue the motion by driving your hips upward and rolling them over their trapped leg side, using your underhook to guide their upper body down to the mat, maintaining control of their arm and leg as they fall to their back, ensuring you follow through by coming up on top, often landing in a dominant position like mount if their legs are open or side control if they defend. You consolidate the position by securing an underhook or head control to prevent their immediate escape, having successfully reversed the position from bottom half guard to top dominance through a dynamic pendulum sweep.

**Template**: "From Half Guard Bottom, trap opponent's leg, secure underhook on far side, frame with outside arm. Maintain tight underhook, keep hips mobile, swing outside leg back to prepare pendulum motion, control opponent's arm. Use underhook to pull up, swing leg forward for momentum, shift hips underneath, push with knee shield for elevation. Drive hips up, roll opponent over trapped leg side, follow to top position or mount. Consolidate with underhook/head control to secure dominance."

### Execution Steps (Numbered Sequence)
1. **Setup Requirements**: Start in Half Guard Bottom with opponent's leg trapped
2. **Control Establishment**: Secure underhook on far side, frame with outside arm
3. **Posture Defense**: Maintain tight underhook, keep hips turned for mobility
4. **Leg Preparation**: Adjust outside leg back to prepare for pendulum swing
5. **Arm Control**: Use outside hand to control opponent's arm/wrist to limit posting
6. **Hip Preparation**: Shift hips underneath opponent's center of gravity for leverage
7. **Pendulum Action**: Swing outside leg back then forward to build momentum
8. **Elevation Action**: Push with knee shield against chest/shoulder, tighten hook on leg
9. **Sweep Completion**: Drive hips upward, roll opponent over trapped leg side, maintain control
10. **Position Consolidation**: Follow through to top position, secure underhook/head control

### Key Technical Details
Critical elements that determine success:
- **Pendulum Momentum**: Swinging leg motion to build momentum for the sweep
- **Underhook Leverage**: Strong underhook to control upper body and pull towards back
- **Hip Positioning**: Shifting hips underneath opponent for optimal sweep leverage
- **Arm Control**: Controlling opponent's arm to prevent posting and maintain off-balance
- **Follow-Through**: Continuous motion to come up on top after sweep

### Success Modifiers
Factors that increase/decrease probability:
- **Leg Swing**: Effectiveness of pendulum motion for momentum (+/-20%)
- **Opponent Balance**: Degree of base disruption or forward lean (+/-15%)
- **Hip Mobility**: Ability to shift and drive hips dynamically (+/-15%)
- **Underhook Strength**: Control over opponent's upper body (+/-10%)
- **Knowledge Test Performance**: Understanding half guard sweep mechanics (+/-10%)

## Counter-Attack Analysis

### Common Counters
Opponent responses with success rates:
- **Base Recovery**: Widening base to resist momentum → [[Top Half Guard]] (Success Rate: 40%, Conditions: early recognition)
- **Arm Posting**: Freeing controlled arm to post on mat → [[Neutral Position]] (Success Rate: 30%, Conditions: strong grip break)
- **Upper Body Control**: Using crossface or whizzer to resist roll → [[Top Position]] (Success Rate: 20%, Conditions: quick reaction)
- **Counter Sweep**: Using sweep momentum for own attack → [[Top Position]] (Success Rate: 10%, Conditions: advanced skill)

Format: `[[Counter Technique]] → [[Result State]] (Success Rate: X%, Conditions: [when applicable])`

### Decision Logic
```
If [sweep setup] is recognized early:
- Execute [[Base Recovery]] (Probability: 40%)

Else if [grip break] can free controlled arm:
- Attempt [[Arm Posting]] (Probability: 30%)

Else if [upper body control] can resist roll:
- Execute [[Upper Body Control]] (Probability: 20%)

Else [advanced skill] allows counter attack:
- Attempt [[Counter Sweep]] (Probability: 10%)

Else [optimal execution]:
- Accept transition (Probability: Success Rate - Modifiers)
```

## Educational Content

### Expert Insights
Commentary as if from recognized authorities:
- **John Danaher**: "The Pendulum Sweep from half guard is a dynamic technique that exemplifies the principle of using momentum to create sweeping opportunities. The key is in the swinging motion of the leg to build force while maintaining control with the underhook, demonstrating how kinetic energy can overcome static strength. This sweep teaches critical principles of momentum and leverage that are essential for advanced half guard systems."
- **Gordon Ryan**: "In competition, the Pendulum Sweep is a high-percentage move from half guard, especially against opponents who are focused on passing. I focus on the timing of the leg swing and exploding through the hip shift to ensure they roll over cleanly. This technique shows how dynamic half guard sweeps can be adapted into dominant attacks from the bottom."
- **Eddie Bravo**: "Pendulum Sweep is a slick half guard sweep that blends classic control with modern dynamics, offering a reliable way to reverse position. It’s a great move for grapplers who like to use momentum and create powerful sweeps, often chaining into submissions. This sweep integrates well with systems that prioritize fluid transitions and off-balancing from half guard."

Each insight should focus on one key technical or strategic element.

### Common Errors
For knowledge test generation:
- **Error**: Ineffective pendulum swing or momentum
- **Why It Fails**: Lacks force to off-balance opponent, allowing them to maintain base
- **Correction**: Swing outside leg back then forward with power to build momentum
- **Recognition**: Sweep stalls or opponent resists with widened base

- **Error**: Poor hip positioning or insufficient shift
- **Why It Fails**: Reduces leverage for sweep, making roll difficult
- **Correction**: Shift hips significantly underneath opponent's center of gravity
- **Recognition**: Sweep lacks power or opponent maintains balance

- **Error**: Weak underhook or lack of upper body control
- **Why It Fails**: Allows opponent to control your upper body, countering the sweep
- **Correction**: Maintain tight underhook, pull towards their back for leverage
- **Recognition**: Opponent crossfaces or whizzers to resist roll

### Timing Considerations
When to attempt this transition:
- **Optimal Conditions**: When opponent leans forward or focuses on upper body control
- **Avoid When**: Opponent maintains low, wide base with strong posture
- **Setup Sequences**: After establishing underhook and framing in half guard
- **Follow-up Windows**: Must complete sweep within 3-5 seconds to avoid counters
