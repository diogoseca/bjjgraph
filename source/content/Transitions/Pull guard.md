## Transition Description
The guard pull is a fundamental BJJ transition that allows a practitioner to deliberately move from the standing position to a bottom guard position, bypassing the takedown phase. This technique is especially valuable when facing a superior wrestler or judoka, or when your bottom game is more developed than your takedown skills.

## Execution Steps
1. Establish strong sleeve/collar grips (gi) or wrist/neck control (no-gi)
2. Create off-balancing by pulling opponent forward
3. Sit back while maintaining grip control
4. As you sit, swing legs up to establish guard position
5. Immediately secure the closed guard by crossing ankles behind opponent's back
6. Maintain proper defensive posture with elbows tight to body

## Key Grips/Controls
- Collar and sleeve grip (gi)
- Double sleeve grip (gi)
- Collar and elbow grip (gi)
- Wrist and neck control (no-gi)
- Double wrist control (no-gi)

## Common Counters
- [[Toreando Pass]] → [[Side Control]]
- [[Combat Base Entry]] → [[Headquarters Position]]
- [[Stack Pass]] → [[Top Turtle]]
- [[Sprawl During Pull]] → [[Front Headlock]]

## Variants
- Sitting guard pull (direct to seated guard)
- Shin-to-shin guard pull
- De La Riva entry pull
- 2-on-1 control pull
- Butterfly hook immediate insertion

## Expert Insights
- **Danaher System**: Focuses on controlled descent to ensure immediate offensive options upon landing. Emphasizes grips that facilitate quick sweeps once guard is established.
- **Gordon Ryan**: Typically avoids guard pulling in favor of takedowns, but when utilized, will pull directly to butterfly or seated guard for immediate sweep opportunities.
- **Eddie Bravo**: Employs specialized guard pulls directly to rubber guard or Williams guard positions. Often includes immediate overhook controls during the descent to facilitate rapid rubber guard establishment.

## Timing Considerations
- Execute when opponent is advancing forward
- Perform when you have established dominant grips
- Use when opponent has poor posture or balance
- Implement as counter to aggressive takedown pressure

## Follow-up Options
- [[Closed Guard Sweep]] → [[Mount]]
- [[Triangle Setup]] → [[Triangle Control]]
- [[Omoplata]] → [[Omoplata Control]]
- [[Kimura Grip]] → [[Kimura Control]]
- [[Open Guard Transition]] → [[Open Guard Bottom]]
