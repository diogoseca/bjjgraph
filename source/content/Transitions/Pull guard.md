## Transition Description
The Pull Guard is a fundamental defensive technique in Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu (BJJ) used to transition from a Standing Position to a bottom guard position such as Closed Guard or Open Guard. This technique involves pulling the opponent down into your guard to avoid being taken down or to initiate your own ground game strategy. It is particularly effective in scenarios where you prefer to fight from the bottom or need to neutralize an opponent's takedown attempt, embodying the BJJ principle of controlling the fight's domain by choosing your preferred position. The Pull Guard is a common strategy in both gi and no-gi grappling, offering a high-percentage method to bring the fight to the ground on your terms.

## Visual Execution Sequence
Detailed description for clear visualization of the transition in action:

Starting in a Standing Position, you and your opponent are both upright, facing each other, with your hands possibly engaged in grip fighting, collar and sleeve grips in gi, or wrist and neck control in no-gi, as you assess the situation for a takedown opportunity or defend against their attempts. To initiate the Pull Guard, you first establish control by securing a grip on their sleeve or wrist with one hand, say your right hand on their left wrist, while your left hand reaches for their collar or neck to control their posture, stepping back slightly with your right foot to create an angle and prepare to sit down, ensuring you maintain balance to avoid being pulled forward. You then lower your center of gravity by bending your knees, keeping your back straight, as you pull them towards you with both grips, stepping your left foot back to further off-balance them, feeling their weight shift forward as they resist or attempt to stabilize. With controlled timing, you sit down to the mat, pulling them down with you using your grips, while simultaneously wrapping your legs around their torso to establish Closed Guard, locking your ankles behind their back, or keeping your legs open for an Open Guard if they manage to posture up, sensing their attempt to maintain balance as you guide their descent. Mid-transition, you maintain your grips to control their upper body, keeping your elbows tucked to prevent them from standing back up easily, as you adjust your hips to center yourself under them, ensuring your legs are positioned to either lock in Closed Guard or frame for Open Guard, preventing an immediate pass attempt. You complete the transition by settling into your chosen guard position, either tightening your Closed Guard with legs locked and pulling their posture down with your grips, or establishing an active Open Guard with feet on their hips or knees to create distance, having successfully brought the fight to the ground on your terms. Throughout the movement, you remain aware of their attempts to resist the pull or initiate a takedown, adjusting your grip strength and hip positioning to counter their defenses, demonstrating an effective defensive transition technique that shifts the fight from standing to a ground position where you can employ your guard game strategy.

**Template**: "From Standing Position, both upright, facing each other, hands in grip fighting, collar and sleeve grips in gi, or wrist and neck control in no-gi, assessing for takedown or defense. Establish control, grip their left wrist with right hand, reach for collar or neck with left hand for posture control, step back with right foot to angle and prepare to sit, maintain balance. Lower center of gravity, bend knees, keep back straight, pull them towards you with grips, step left foot back to off-balance, shift their weight forward. Sit down to mat with control, pull them down using grips, wrap legs around torso for Closed Guard, lock ankles behind back, or keep legs open for Open Guard if they posture, guide their descent. Maintain grips mid-transition for upper body control, tuck elbows to prevent stand-up, adjust hips to center under them, position legs for Closed or Open Guard, prevent immediate pass. Settle into guard, tighten Closed Guard with legs locked and posture pull, or establish active Open Guard with feet on hips or knees for distance, bring fight to ground on your terms. Stay aware of resistance or takedown attempts, adjust grip strength and hip positioning to counter, shift fight from standing to ground for guard game strategy."

## Execution Steps
1. Begin in a Standing Position, recognizing the opportunity to pull guard when you prefer to fight from the bottom or need to neutralize an opponent's takedown attempt.
2. Establish control by securing a grip on their sleeve or wrist with one hand, and reaching for their collar or neck with the other hand to control their posture, stepping back slightly to create an angle.
3. Lower your center of gravity by bending your knees, keeping your back straight, as you pull them towards you with both grips, stepping your other foot back to further off-balance them.
4. Sit down to the mat with control, pulling them down with you using your grips, while wrapping your legs around their torso to aim for Closed Guard, or preparing for Open Guard if needed.
5. Maintain your grips to control their upper body during the transition, keeping your elbows tucked to prevent them from standing back up easily, as you adjust your hips to center yourself under them.
6. Position your legs to either lock in Closed Guard by securing your ankles behind their back, or frame for Open Guard with feet on their hips or knees to create distance, preventing an immediate pass.
7. Settle into your chosen guard position, tightening your Closed Guard with legs locked and pulling their posture down, or establishing an active Open Guard to control space and initiate attacks.
8. Remain aware of their attempts to resist the pull or initiate a takedown during the transition, adjusting your grip strength, hip positioning, and leg placement to counter and secure the guard position.

## Key Details
- **Grip Establishment**: Secure sleeve/wrist and collar/neck grips to control opponent's posture.
- **Angle Creation**: Step back to create an angle for pulling, maintaining balance.
- **Controlled Descent**: Sit down with control to avoid hard impact or loss of position.
- **Leg Positioning**: Wrap legs for Closed Guard or frame for Open Guard based on opponent's reaction.
- **Upper Body Control**: Maintain grips and tucked elbows to prevent opponent from standing up.
- **Hip Adjustment**: Center hips under opponent for optimal guard control and leverage.
- **Guard Selection**: Choose Closed or Open Guard based on opponent's posture and resistance.
- **Defensive Awareness**: Monitor opponent's takedown or resistance attempts during transition.

## Success Modifiers
Factors that influence the success rate of the transition:
- **Grip Strength**: Ability to control opponent's upper body with secure grips (+10%)
- **Timing Precision**: Executing the pull when opponent is off-balance or committed (+8%)
- **Angle Effectiveness**: Proper stepping back to create pulling leverage (+7%)
- **Controlled Descent**: Sitting down without losing balance or control (+5%)
- **Experience Level**: Familiarity with guard pulling mechanics and guard establishment (+5% per skill level)

## Common Counters and Counter-Attacks
Analysis of opponent responses with success rates for counter-attacks:
- **Posture Resistance** → [[Standing Guard]] (Success Rate: 35%, Conditions: opponent maintains strong posture and resists being pulled down)
- **Takedown Attempt** → [[Top Position]] (Success Rate: 30%, Conditions: opponent capitalizes on pull to initiate a takedown)
- **Guard Pass Attempt** → [[Side Control]] (Success Rate: 25%, Conditions: opponent immediately attempts to pass as you sit down)
- **Sprawl Defense** → [[Neutral Position]] (Success Rate: 20%, Conditions: opponent sprawls to avoid being pulled into guard)
- **Grip Break** → [[Standing Position]] (Success Rate: 15%, Conditions: opponent breaks grips before you can pull them down)

## Decision Logic for Transition
```
If [opponent posture] is upright or committed forward:
- Initiate [[Pull Guard]] to bring fight to ground (Probability: 80%)

Else if [opponent takedown] is imminent or aggressive:
- Execute [[Pull Guard]] to neutralize takedown (Probability: 75%)

Else if [personal strategy] favors bottom game:
- Attempt [[Pull Guard]] to establish guard (Probability: 70%)

Else if [opponent resists] with strong posture or grip breaks mid-pull:
- Adjust to [[Defensive Stand]] for safety (Probability: 50%)

Else if [pull fails] due to opponent’s sprawl or takedown:
- Transition to [[Guard Recovery]] to mitigate (Probability: 40%)
```

## Variants
- **Standard Pull Guard**: Classic pull to Closed Guard with sleeve and collar grips.
- **Jump Guard Pull**: Jumping to wrap legs around opponent for immediate guard.
- **No-Gi Pull Guard**: Using wrist and neck control instead of gi grips.
- **Open Guard Pull**: Pulling directly to Open Guard with feet on hips for distance.
- **De La Riva Pull**: Transitioning to De La Riva Guard after pulling.
- **Sitting Guard Pull**: Sitting down without strong upper body pull for quick guard.
- **Dynamic Pull**: Incorporating footwork to off-balance opponent before pulling.
- **Feint Pull**: Faking a pull to bait opponent into a different reaction.

## Tactical Applications
- **Takedown Defense**: Primary use to avoid being taken down by opponent.
- **Bottom Game Strategy**: Sets up preferred guard position for sweeps or submissions.
- **Control Establishment**: Brings fight to ground on your terms for strategic advantage.
- **Energy Efficiency**: Low energy cost allows focus on subsequent guard techniques.
