## State Machine Content Elements

### Visual Execution Sequence
From compromised bottom position with opponent establishing or transitioning control, you assess their control points and pressure direction. You create minimal space using frames or shrimping motion to enable rolling movement. Rolling to your back while maintaining frames on opponent's hips or shoulders, you create and maintain distance. As you complete the roll, you insert your guard hooks or establish guard configuration. You control the distance using active frames to prevent immediate passing. You secure your preferred guard variation with appropriate grips and posture control, successfully completing the guard recovery.

**Template**: "From compromised bottom position, assess opponent's control, create space with frames, roll to your back maintaining distance, insert guard hooks during roll, control distance with frames, and secure guard position with grips."

### Execution Steps (Numbered Sequence)
1. **Assess Position**: Evaluate current bottom position, opponent's control points, and pressure direction
2. **Create Space**: Use frames, shrimping, or small movements to create minimal space for rolling motion
3. **Initiate Roll**: Roll smoothly to your back while creating frames on opponent's hips or shoulders
4. **Insert Hooks**: Insert guard hooks, knee shields, or other guard configuration during rolling motion
5. **Control Distance**: Use active frames to maintain optimal distance and prevent passing immediately
6. **Establish Guard**: Secure closed guard, open guard, or half guard with appropriate grips and control

### Key Technical Details
Critical elements that determine success:
- **Grip Requirements**: Frames on hips/shoulders initially, guard-specific grips after establishment
- **Base/Foundation**: Rolling motion from compromised position to guard configuration
- **Timing Windows**: Execute during opponent's transition or weight adjustment
- **Leverage Points**: Frames create distance, hooks establish guard control
- **Common Adjustments**: Adjust guard type based on opponent's position and reactions

### Success Modifiers
Factors that increase/decrease probability:
- **Setup Quality**: Frame effectiveness and rolling timing (+/-10%)
- **Timing Precision**: Rolling when opponent transitions or adjusts (+/-15%)
- **Opponent Fatigue**: Reduced passing pressure and speed (+/-5%)
- **Knowledge Test Performance**: Understanding guard recovery principles (+/-10%)
- **Position Control**: Quality of distance management and frame maintenance (+/-10%)

## Counter-Attack Analysis

### Common Counters
Opponent responses with success rates:
- **Immediate Pass**: Attacking pass during roll → [[Guard Pass]] (Success Rate: 40%, Conditions: quick reaction)
- **Sprawl and Pressure**: Preventing hooks with sprawl → [[Top Position]] (Success Rate: 35%, Conditions: strong base)
- **Leg Weave**: Weaving through hooks during establishment → [[Leg Weave Pass]] (Success Rate: 35%, Conditions: timing)
- **Stack Pressure**: Stacking during roll → [[Stack Pass]] (Success Rate: 30%, Conditions: weight distribution)

Format: `[[Counter Technique]] → [[Result State]] (Success Rate: X%, Conditions: [when applicable])`

### Decision Logic
```
If [roll detected early]:
- Execute [[Immediate Pass]] (Probability: 40%)

Else if [hooks not yet inserted]:
- Execute [[Sprawl and Pressure]] (Probability: 35%)

Else if [can weave through hooks]:
- Execute [[Leg Weave]] (Probability: 35%)

Else [guard established]:
- Accept transition (Probability: Success Rate - Modifiers)
```

## Educational Content

### Expert Insights
Commentary as if from recognized authorities:
- **John Danaher**: "Rolling to guard is one of the most fundamental and important defensive skills in Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu. When you find yourself in a compromised bottom position - whether during a scramble, after being swept, or when recovering from turtle - the ability to smoothly roll to your guard is essential. The key technical element is maintaining active frames throughout the entire rolling motion. Without frames, your opponent will simply follow your roll and establish dominant passing position. The frames create the critical distance that allows you to insert your hooks and establish guard. This is not a passive defensive action - it requires active frame pressure and immediate hook insertion."
- **Gordon Ryan**: "Guard recovery through rolling is something I do constantly in training and competition. The timing is everything - you want to roll when your opponent is between positions or adjusting their weight, not when they have stable heavy pressure. I focus on keeping my frames extremely active during the roll so they can't close distance. The moment my back touches the mat, I'm already inserting my hooks or knee shields. There should be no delay between the roll and guard establishment. That instantaneous hook insertion is what separates successful guard recovery from giving up easy passing positions."
- **Eddie Bravo**: "Rolling to guard is a fundamental movement pattern that our guys drill constantly. It connects to everything - scrambles, turtle escapes, guard retention. The key is being comfortable rolling to your back in chaotic situations without panicking. You roll, you frame, you get your hooks in - it's one fluid motion. We practice this from every possible angle and position so it becomes completely instinctive. When you're comfortable rolling to guard, you can recover from all kinds of bad positions. It's a foundational skill that makes everything else in your guard game possible."

Each insight should focus on one key technical or strategic element.

### Common Errors
For knowledge test generation:
- **Error**: Rolling without establishing frames first
- **Why It Fails**: Opponent closes distance immediately, preventing guard establishment
- **Correction**: Create frames simultaneously with rolling motion
- **Recognition**: Opponent stays close throughout roll, easy passing position

- **Error**: Delaying hook insertion after completing roll
- **Why It Fails**: Gives opponent time to initiate passing sequence
- **Correction**: Insert hooks immediately as back touches mat, continuous motion
- **Recognition**: Successfully roll but end in scramble or passing situation

- **Error**: Rolling at wrong timing with opponent having stable pressure
- **Why It Fails**: Opponent's weight prevents effective rolling motion
- **Correction**: Wait for opponent's weight transition or create small space first
- **Recognition**: Cannot complete roll smoothly, feels blocked

- **Error**: Using passive frames instead of active pushing
- **Why It Fails**: Opponent can easily collapse frames and close distance
- **Correction**: Actively push with frames to maintain maximum distance
- **Recognition**: Frames collapse easily, opponent maintains close pressure

- **Error**: Not adjusting guard type based on situation
- **Why It Fails**: Attempting specific guard when position dictates different option
- **Correction**: Assess position during roll and establish most appropriate guard type
- **Recognition**: Guard feels unstable or immediately passed

### Timing Considerations
When to attempt this transition:
- **Optimal Conditions**: Opponent transitioning positions, weight adjusting, or scramble situation
- **Avoid When**: Opponent has heavy stable pressure with no movement
- **Setup Sequences**: After creating space from bad positions, during scrambles
- **Follow-up Windows**: Must establish guard within 1-2 seconds after roll

### Prerequisites
Requirements before attempting:
- **Technical Skills**: Rolling coordination, frame creation, hook insertion, guard establishment
- **Physical Preparation**: Hip mobility for rolling, core for frames
- **Positional Understanding**: Guard types, distance management, defensive concepts
- **Experience Level**: Beginner-friendly fundamental defensive skill
