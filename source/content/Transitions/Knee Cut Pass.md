## Transition Description
The Knee Cut Pass, also known as the Knee Slice Pass, is a fundamental guard passing technique in Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu (BJJ) used to transition from a top position in Half Guard or Open Guard to a dominant control position like Side Control or Mount. This technique involves driving the knee through the opponent's guard, slicing between their legs, while maintaining posture and control to bypass their defensive barriers. It is highly effective against various guard types due to its simplicity and adaptability, embodying the BJJ principle of using precise movement and weight distribution to overcome resistance. The Knee Cut Pass is a staple in both gi and no-gi grappling, offering a direct path to positional dominance.

## Visual Execution Sequence
Detailed description for clear visualization of the transition in action:

Starting in top Half Guard, you are on your knees with your right leg trapped between your opponent's legs, their left leg framing against your torso, and their arms controlling your posture with grips on your collar or sleeves, attempting to prevent your advance or set up a sweep. To initiate the Knee Cut Pass, you first posture up by straightening your back and tucking your elbows in, breaking their control over your upper body, while securing an underhook with your right arm under their left armpit to pin their torso and limit their mobility. You then shift your weight slightly back, pulling your trapped right knee out just enough to create space, and step your left leg up, placing your left foot flat on the mat near their hip as a base to drive forward, preparing to slice your right knee through their guard. With controlled pressure, you drive your right knee forward and across their left thigh, cutting through the space between their legs, while simultaneously pushing their left knee down with your left hand to prevent it from blocking your path, feeling their guard structure weaken as your knee advances. Mid-pass, you maintain your underhook and keep your head low to avoid submissions like triangles or guillotines, sliding your right shin over their thigh and dropping your hips to pin their lower body, ensuring they cannot shrimp away or recover guard as your torso clears their legs. You complete the pass by settling into Side Control, driving your chest into theirs, securing their head with your right underhook and blocking their far hip with your left arm, or potentially stepping over to Mount if their legs are open, having successfully bypassed their guard with a precise knee slice. Throughout the movement, you remain aware of their attempts to frame or sweep, adjusting your weight distribution to counter their defenses, demonstrating a core offensive passing technique that transforms a contested guard position into dominant control in a methodical, pressure-driven sequence.

**Template**: "From top Half Guard, on knees, right leg trapped, opponentâ€™s left leg framing torso, arms gripping collar or sleeves for control. Posture up, straighten back, tuck elbows to break control, secure right underhook under left armpit to pin torso. Shift weight back, pull right knee out for space, step left leg up, foot flat near hip as base to drive forward. Drive right knee across their left thigh, cut through guard, push left knee down with left hand to clear path, weaken guard structure. Maintain underhook mid-pass, head low against submissions, slide right shin over thigh, drop hips to pin, prevent guard recovery. Settle into Side Control, chest to chest, secure head with underhook, block far hip, or step to Mount if open, bypass guard with knee slice. Stay aware of frame or sweep attempts, adjust weight to counter, transform contested guard into dominant control with methodical pressure."

## Execution Steps
1. Begin in top Half Guard or Open Guard, recognizing the opportunity to pass when the opponent's guard is not fully locked or their posture control is weak.
2. Posture up by straightening your back and tucking your elbows in to break their grip control over your upper body, maintaining a strong base.
3. Secure an underhook with one arm under their armpit on the side of the trapped leg (if in Half Guard) or on a controlling side (if in Open Guard), pinning their torso to limit mobility.
4. Shift your weight slightly back to create space, pulling your trapped knee out (if applicable), and step your outside leg up, placing the foot flat near their hip as a driving base.
5. Drive your trapped or passing knee forward and across their thigh, slicing through the space between their legs, while using your free hand to push their blocking knee down to clear the path.
6. Maintain your underhook and keep your head low to protect against submissions, sliding your shin over their thigh and dropping your hips to pin their lower body, preventing guard recovery.
7. Complete the pass by settling into Side Control, driving your chest into theirs, securing their head with the underhook and blocking their far hip with your other arm, or stepping over to Mount if their legs are open.
8. Remain aware of their defensive attempts like framing or sweeping, adjusting your weight and pressure to counter and consolidate the dominant position.

## Key Details
- **Posture Maintenance**: Essential to break opponentâ€™s upper body control and prevent submissions.
- **Underhook Control**: Pins opponentâ€™s torso to limit their defensive mobility.
- **Base Establishment**: Outside leg steps up for driving power and stability.
- **Knee Slice Precision**: Cutting knee must pass through guard with controlled pressure.
- **Knee Block Defense**: Free hand pushes opponentâ€™s blocking leg to clear path.
- **Head Position Safety**: Keep head low to avoid triangle or guillotine setups.
- **Hip Pinning**: Drop hips post-slice to prevent shrimping or guard recovery
