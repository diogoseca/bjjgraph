## Transition Properties
- **Transition ID**: T701
- **Starting State**: [[Headquarters Position]] (primary), [[Top Position]], or [[Combat Base]]

- **Success Probability**: Beginner (60%), Intermediate (75%), Advanced (85%)
- **Execution Complexity**: Medium
- **Physical Attributes**: Hip mobility (Medium), Pressure application (Medium-High)

## Transition Description
The Knee Cut Pass is a fundamental guard passing technique where the top player slides their knee across the opponent's hip line while controlling the upper body, effectively "cutting" through the guard to establish side control. This technique combines pressure, angle creation, and upper body control to bypass the opponent's defensive frames and establish a dominant position. The Knee Cut is one of the highest-percentage passing techniques in BJJ, offering strong control throughout the movement with minimal risk of counterattack.

## Execution Steps
1. From Headquarters or similar position, control opponent's bottom knee with your hand
2. Establish sleeve, collar, or shoulder control with your other hand
3. Shift weight forward while positioning your outside knee for the cut
4. Drive your cutting knee diagonally across opponent's hip line 
5. Apply chest pressure to opponent's upper body to prevent them from sitting up
6. Maintain control of opponent's leg to prevent guard recovery
7. Keep your base low and wide to prevent being rolled
8. Clear opponent's bottom leg as you slide into side control
9. Consolidate position by establishing proper side control grips

## Key Grips/Controls
- Same-side sleeve or collar grip (upper body control)
- Same-side knee or pants grip (lower body control)
- Chest-to-chest pressure during pass
- Head positioning to prevent opponent's mobility
- Hip control to prevent defensive framing
- Base management throughout movement

## Common Counters
- [[Underhook Defense]] → [[Half Guard Recovery]]
- [[Knee Shield]] → [[Knee Shield Half Guard]]
- [[Deep Half Entry]] → [[Deep Half Guard]]
- [[Roll Under]] → [[Leg Entanglement]]
- [[Frame and Invert]] → [[Inverted Guard]]

## Variants
- Traditional knee cut (direct pressure)
- Floating knee cut (reduced pressure with mobility)
- Cross-face knee cut (emphasizing head control)
- Back step knee cut (with direction change)
- Double-under grip knee cut (controlling both legs)
- Knee cut to mount (transitioning directly to mount)

## Expert Insights
- **Danaher System**: Emphasizes the importance of controlling the "inside space" during the knee cut, preventing the opponent from establishing frames that would block the pass. Creates a systematic approach to breaking down each defensive barrier with proper weight distribution and precise angles that maximize mechanical advantage while minimizing defensive opportunities.
- **Gordon Ryan**: Utilizes a "floating" approach to the knee cut, maintaining lighter pressure initially to bait defensive reactions before committing to heavy pressure. Emphasizes the upper body control aspect, particularly the cross-face and underhook combinations that neutralize the opponent's upper body defensive resources.
- **Eddie Bravo**: Incorporates the knee cut into his no-gi system with modified grips, often focusing on head control rather than traditional collar grips. Emphasizes quick transitions to specialized control positions rather than conventional side control, particularly the "Twister Side Control" as the end goal.

## Timing Considerations
- Execute when opponent attempts to establish knee shield
- Perform immediately after breaking opponent's grips
- Time with opponent's attempt to recover guard
- Implement when opponent creates space by framing
- Use as a follow-up when other passes are defended

## Follow-up Options
- [[Side Control Consolidation]] → [[Side Control]]
- [[Transition to Mount]] → [[Mount]]
- [[Kimura Trap]] → [[Kimura Control]]
- [[Near Side Armbar]] → [[Armbar Control]]
- [[North-South Transition]] → [[North-South]]

## Common Errors
- Insufficient upper body control → Vulnerable to underhooks
- Poor knee angle → Stuck in half guard
- Weak base during transition → Susceptible to sweeps
- Disconnected upper and lower body control → Pass stalling
- Rushing final position → Allowing defensive recovery

## Computer Science Analogy
The Knee Cut Pass represents an efficient edge traversal in the BJJ state graph, with a high success probability (weight) between the Headquarters Position node and the Side Control node. The technique functions like a "branch prediction" algorithm in computing, where anticipating the opponent's defensive response allows for optimal path selection with minimal computational cost (energy expenditure).
