## State Machine Content Elements

### Visual Execution Sequence
Detailed step-by-step description for clear movement sequence visualization:

From closed guard bottom, you initiate by controlling one of the opponent's arms with a strong two-on-one grip, pulling it across your body to break their posture. Your opponent typically resists by posturing up or attempting to pull their arm back. You then use an arm drag technique, pulling their arm across and to the side while simultaneously opening your guard and shifting your hips to create an angle. As their balance is disrupted, you place one foot on the mat to push off and use your other leg to trap their opposite leg, preventing them from stepping out. With a strong hip thrust and continued arm control, you roll them over to the side of the trapped arm, following through to land in mount or a dominant top position.

**Template**: "From closed guard, you control their arm with a two-on-one grip and drag it across your body. Your opponent resists, but you shift your hips and open your guard to create an angle. Using one foot to push off and trapping their leg with the other, you roll them over with a strong hip thrust, landing on top in mount."

### Execution Steps (Numbered Sequence)
1. **Setup Requirements**: Establish closed guard with strong posture control
2. **Initial Movement**: Secure a two-on-one grip on opponent's arm
3. **Opponent Response**: Opponent typically postures up or pulls arm back
4. **Adaptation**: Use arm drag to pull their arm across and to the side
5. **Positioning**: Open guard, shift hips for angle, trap their opposite leg
6. **Completion**: Push off with one foot, thrust hips, roll opponent over to mount

### Key Technical Details
Critical elements that determine success:
- **Grip Requirements**: Strong two-on-one grip for arm control
- **Base/Foundation**: Hip movement and angle creation for sweep leverage
- **Timing Windows**: Execute when opponent's posture is broken or arm is isolated
- **Leverage Points**: Arm drag and hip thrust create sweeping motion
- **Common Adjustments**: Adjust hip angle and leg placement based on resistance

### Success Modifiers
Factors that increase/decrease probability:
- **Setup Quality**: Strong grip and posture control (+/-15%)
- **Timing Precision**: Executing during opponent's posture break (+/-20%)
- **Opponent Fatigue**: Reduced ability to resist sweep (+/-5%)
- **Knowledge Test Performance**: Understanding arm drag mechanics (+/-10%)
- **Position Control**: Quality of closed guard control (+/-10%)

## Counter-Attack Analysis

### Common Counters
Opponent responses with success rates:
- **Posture Defense**: Maintaining strong posture to prevent arm drag → [[Closed Guard Top]] (Success Rate: 50%, Conditions: early recognition)
- **Arm Pullback**: Retracting arm before sweep completion → [[Closed Guard Top]] (Success Rate: 45%, Conditions: quick reaction)
- **Leg Step-Out**: Stepping out with trapped leg to maintain base → [[Closed Guard Top]] (Success Rate: 40%, Conditions: balance awareness)
- **Base Widening**: Widening base to resist roll → [[Closed Guard Top]] (Success Rate: 35%, Conditions: strong base)

Format: `[[Counter Technique]] → [[Result State]] (Success Rate: X%, Conditions: [when applicable])`

### Decision Logic
```
If [waiter sweep setup] is telegraphed early:
- Execute [[Posture Defense]] (Probability: 50%)

Else if [arm drag] is recognized:
- Execute [[Arm Pullback]] (Probability: 45%)

Else if [leg trap] can be countered:
- Execute [[Leg Step-Out]] (Probability: 40%)

Else [optimal sweep execution]:
- Accept transition (Probability: Success Rate - Modifiers)
```

## Educational Content

### Expert Insights
Commentary as if from recognized authorities:
- **John Danaher**: "The waiter sweep is a fundamental technique that succeeds through precise arm control and hip movement rather than strength. The key is understanding that the arm drag must break the opponent's posture while the hip shift creates the necessary angle for the sweep. This technique teaches essential principles of posture control that apply throughout guard play."
- **Gordon Ryan**: "In competition, the waiter sweep is highly effective because it works against opponents who overcommit to posture. I use it to transition to mount where I can implement my top game advantages. The element of controlling their arm makes it a low-risk, high-reward sweep."
- **Eddie Bravo**: "The waiter sweep integrates well with other closed guard attacks and can be modified for different grip configurations. When the sweep is partially defended, it often creates opportunities for submissions like triangles or armbars. The technique demonstrates how fundamental sweeps can be adapted for modern grappling scenarios."

Each insight should focus on one key technical or strategic element.

### Common Errors
For knowledge test generation:
- **Error**: Attempting sweep without breaking opponent's posture
- **Why It Fails**: Insufficient control over opponent's upper body
- **Correction**: Always use arm drag to break posture before sweeping
- **Recognition**: Feeling resistance due to opponent's strong posture

- **Error**: Poor hip angle during sweep execution
- **Why It Fails**: Lack of proper angle reduces leverage for the roll
- **Correction**: Shift hips to create a clear angle before thrusting
- **Recognition**: Opponent easily maintains balance despite arm control

- **Error**: Not trapping opponent's leg effectively
- **Why It Fails**: Allows opponent to step out and maintain base
- **Correction**: Ensure leg trap with your own leg before rolling
- **Recognition**: Opponent steps out of sweep attempt easily

### Timing Considerations
When to attempt this transition:
- **Optimal Conditions**: When opponent's posture is broken or arm is isolated
- **Avoid When**: Opponent maintains strong posture and base
- **Setup Sequences**: After failed submission attempts that break posture
- **Follow-up Windows**: Must complete within 3-5 seconds to prevent counter

### Prerequisites
Requirements before attempting:
- **Technical Skills**: Basic closed guard control and arm drag technique
- **Physical Preparation**: Hip mobility and coordination for angle creation
- **Positional Understanding**: Closed guard mechanics and sweep principles
- **Experience Level**: Beginner to intermediate technique requiring timing

## Technical Assessment Elements

### Knowledge Assessment Questions
5 technical questions with multiple choice answers:
- **Mechanical Understanding**: "What creates the sweeping force in the waiter sweep?"
- **Timing Recognition**: "When is the optimal moment to execute the arm drag?"
- **Error Prevention**: "What is the most common setup mistake in this sweep?"
- **Setup Requirements**: "Which grip is essential for breaking opponent's posture?"
- **Adaptation**: "How do you adjust if opponent resists the initial arm drag?"

### Variants and Adaptations
Different versions for various scenarios:
- **Gi Specific**: Using sleeve grips for enhanced arm control
- **No-Gi Specific**: Wrist control adaptations for arm drag
- **Self-Defense**: Modified version for quick transition to top control
