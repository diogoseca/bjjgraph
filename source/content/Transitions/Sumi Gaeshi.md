### Visual Execution Sequence
Detailed step-by-step description for clear movement sequence visualization:

From a standing clinch or over-under grip position, you engage with the opponent, securing a strong grip on their upper body, typically an overhook on one arm and an underhook on the other, while maintaining close hip contact. As the opponent pushes forward or resists, you initiate the throw by stepping to the side, placing your foot near their far foot to create an angle, and dropping your hips low to prepare for the sacrifice. You then pull their upper body forward and down with your grips, using their momentum against them, while simultaneously sitting back and rolling onto your back, guiding their body over your hip and shoulder. As you fall, you use your legs to lift and direct their lower body, flipping them over you to land on their back. Immediately after the throw, you follow through by rolling with the momentum to come up on top, establishing a dominant position such as mount or side control, securing control with chest pressure and arm isolation to prevent their escape.

**Template**: "From a standing clinch with over-under grips, step to the side near their far foot and drop your hips low. Pull their upper body forward and down, sit back, and roll onto your back, using your legs to flip them over your hip. Follow through by rolling on top into mount or side control, securing dominance."

### Execution Steps (Numbered Sequence)
1. **Setup Requirements**: Establish clinch with overhook and underhook grips
2. **Initial Positioning**: Maintain close hip contact with opponent
3. **Opponent Response**: Opponent pushes forward or resists your control
4. **Angle Creation**: Step to side, placing foot near their far foot
5. **Sacrifice Initiation**: Drop hips low and pull opponent forward/down
6. **Throw Execution**: Sit back, roll onto back, lift with legs to flip opponent
7. **Follow Through**: Roll with momentum to come up on top
8. **Position Consolidation**: Establish mount or side control with control

### Key Technical Details
Critical elements that determine success:
- **Grip Strength**: Secure over-under grips to control opponent's upper body
- **Hip Positioning**: Close hip contact and low drop for leverage
- **Timing**: Execute as opponent pushes or overcommits forward
- **Leg Lift**: Use legs to elevate opponent's lower body during throw
- **Momentum Control**: Guide opponent's fall and follow through to top position

### Success Modifiers
Factors that increase/decrease probability:
- **Grip Quality**: Strength and control of over-under grips (+/-15%)
- **Opponent Momentum**: Capitalizing on forward push or resistance (+/-20%)
- **Timing Precision**: Executing at the right moment of overcommitment (+/-15%)
- **Hip Drop**: Depth and speed of hip lowering for sacrifice (+/-10%)
- **Knowledge Test Performance**: Understanding sacrifice throw mechanics (+/-10%)

## Counter-Attack Analysis

### Common Counters
Opponent responses with success rates:
- **Base Defense**: Widening base to prevent throw → [[Standing Position]] (Success Rate: 50%, Conditions: early recognition)
- **Posture Adjustment**: Straightening posture to resist pull → [[Clinch Position]] (Success Rate: 45%, Conditions: quick reaction)
- **Step Over**: Stepping over during sacrifice to land on top → [[Top Position]] (Success Rate: 35%, Conditions: fast adjustment)
- **Grip Break**: Breaking grips before throw initiation → [[Neutral Position]] (Success Rate: 30%, Conditions: strong grip defense)

Format: `[[Counter Technique]] → [[Result State]] (Success Rate: X%, Conditions: [when applicable])`

### Decision Logic
```
If [throw setup] is recognized early:
- Execute [[Base Defense]] (Probability: 50%)

Else if [posture] can be corrected quickly:
- Execute [[Posture Adjustment]] (Probability: 45%)

Else if [sacrifice] is initiated:
- Attempt [[Step Over]] (Probability: 35%)

Else [grips] are vulnerable:
- Attempt [[Grip Break]] (Probability: 30%)

Else [optimal execution]:
- Accept transition (Probability: Success Rate - Modifiers)
```

## Educational Content

### Expert Insights
Commentary as if from recognized authorities:
- **John Danaher**: "Sumi Gaeshi exemplifies the principle of using an opponent's energy against them through a sacrifice throw. The key is in the precise timing of the hip drop and pull, ensuring their momentum carries them over you with minimal effort. This technique teaches critical concepts of leverage and kuzushi that apply to all takedowns."
- **Gordon Ryan**: "In high-level competition, Sumi Gaeshi can be a game-changer because it catches opponents off-guard when they push into you. I use it to transition directly to dominant positions like mount, capitalizing on their forward pressure. The move demonstrates how judo-based throws can be adapted for BJJ scoring."
- **Eddie Bravo**: "Sumi Gaeshi integrates well with a dynamic stand-up game and can be chained with guard pulls if it fails. It often surprises opponents who aren't expecting a sacrifice throw, creating scramble opportunities even if you don't land on top. This technique shows how traditional judo can be applied creatively in no-gi contexts."

Each insight should focus on one key technical or strategic element.

### Common Errors
For knowledge test generation:
- **Error**: Mistiming the hip drop and pull
- **Why It Fails**: Allows opponent to maintain balance and resist throw
- **Correction**: Wait for opponent's forward push before initiating sacrifice
- **Recognition**: Opponent stays upright or steps over during attempt

- **Error**: Insufficient grip control or pull
- **Why It Fails**: Fails to off-balance opponent for the throw
- **Correction**: Secure strong over-under grips and pull down with intent
- **Recognition**: Opponent easily maintains posture or breaks grips

- **Error**: Poor follow-through after throw
- **Why It Fails**: Allows opponent to scramble or regain position
- **Correction**: Roll with momentum to establish top control immediately
- **Recognition**: End up on bottom or in neutral position after throw

### Timing Considerations
When to attempt this transition:
- **Optimal Conditions**: When opponent pushes forward or overcommits
- **Avoid When**: Opponent maintains strong defensive posture or wide base
- **Setup Sequences**: After establishing clinch with over-under control
- **Follow-up Windows**: Must complete throw within 2-3 seconds to avoid counters

### Prerequisites
Requirements before attempting:
- **Technical Skills**: Understanding of clinch grips and sacrifice mechanics
- **Physical Preparation**: Hip mobility and explosive power for throw
- **Positional Understanding**: Control points in standing and clinch positions
