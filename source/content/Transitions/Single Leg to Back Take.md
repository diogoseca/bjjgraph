## State Machine Content Elements

### Visual Execution Sequence
Detailed step-by-step description for clear movement sequence visualization:

When you've secured a single leg but your opponent successfully defends the takedown by turning away from you, planting their hands, or rotating to face you, you recognize the opportunity to transition to back control. Instead of fighting to finish the takedown against their defensive posture, you maintain tight control on their captured leg and follow their rotational movement. As they turn to face you or try to escape, you use their leg as a lever and climbing point, pulling yourself up onto their back while they're focused on defending the takedown. You establish your near-side hook first, threading your leg in while still controlling their leg. Once the first hook is secure, you release the leg control and complete the back take by inserting your second hook and establishing your seat belt grip. Your opponent, having defended the takedown, now finds themselves in an even worse position with you in full back control.

**Template**: "From defended single leg, recognize opponent's rotation, maintain leg control while following their movement, climb to their back using leg as lever, establish first hook, complete back control with second hook and seat belt."

### Execution Steps (Numbered Sequence)
1. **Recognize Opportunity**: Identify when opponent defends single leg by turning away or posting hands
2. **Maintain Leg Control**: Keep tight control on captured leg while following opponent's rotation
3. **Climb to Back**: Use captured leg as lever to climb up opponent's back as they turn
4. **Secure First Hook**: Establish near-side hook with leg while maintaining leg control
5. **Complete Back Control**: Insert second hook and establish seat belt grip for full back control
6. **Consolidate Position**: Secure both hooks and control opponent's posture for dominant back control

### Key Technical Details
Critical elements that determine success:
- **Grip Requirements**: Maintain leg control until first hook is established
- **Base/Foundation**: Follow opponent's movement fluidly without resisting rotation
- **Timing Windows**: Transition must occur during opponent's defensive rotation (3-5 seconds)
- **Leverage Points**: Use captured leg as climbing point and lever for elevation
- **Common Adjustments**: Vary climbing angle based on opponent's direction of rotation

### Success Modifiers
Factors that increase/decrease probability:
- **Recognition Speed**: Identifying back take opportunity early (+/-15%)
- **Leg Control**: Maintaining grip throughout transition (+/-12%)
- **Climbing Technique**: Efficient use of leg as lever for elevation (+/-10%)
- **Hook Insertion**: Quick first hook establishment (+/-10%)
- **Follow-Through**: Completing full back control before opponent recovers (+/-8%)

## Counter-Attack Analysis

### Common Counters
Opponent responses with success rates:
- **Sit Through**: Rotating through to face attacker → [[Guard Position]] (Success Rate: 50%, Conditions: early recognition)
- **Stand and Turn**: Recovering standing base while clearing leg → [[Standing Position]] (Success Rate: 45%, Conditions: strong base)
- **Roll Forward**: Forward roll to clear back attachment → [[Top Position]] (Success Rate: 40%, Conditions: timing dependent)
- **Sprawl and Spin**: Sprawling while spinning to face attacker → [[Front Headlock]] (Success Rate: 35%, Conditions: athletic ability)

Format: `[[Counter Technique]] → [[Result State]] (Success Rate: X%, Conditions: [when applicable])`

### Decision Logic
```
If [back climb] is recognized early:
- Execute [[Sit Through]] (Probability: 50%)

Else if [first hook] is not yet secured:
- Execute [[Stand and Turn]] (Probability: 45%)

Else if [momentum] can be redirected:
- Execute [[Roll Forward]] (Probability: 40%)

Else [optimal back take execution]:
- Accept transition (Probability: Success Rate - Modifiers)
```

## Educational Content

### Expert Insights
Commentary as if from recognized authorities:
- **John Danaher**: "The single leg to back take represents excellent tactical adaptability - converting a partially successful attack into an even more dominant position. The key mechanical principle is recognizing that when an opponent defends the single leg by turning away, they're actually presenting their back as they attempt to escape. Rather than fighting against their defensive rotation, you follow it and use their own movement to climb to back control. The captured leg functions as both a control point and a climbing ladder that allows you to elevate onto their back. This technique exemplifies the principle of not forcing techniques against strong resistance but instead redirecting efforts toward more available opportunities."
- **Gordon Ryan**: "In competition, the single leg to back take is one of my highest percentage transitions because opponents rarely expect it. When they successfully defend my takedown, they think they're safe and often relax momentarily - that's when I climb to their back. The critical element is maintaining leg control throughout the transition - if you release the leg too early, they can turn back into you and defend. I wait until my first hook is completely secured before releasing the leg. The timing is everything - you have to commit to the back take as they're rotating, not after they've stopped and reset their base. This transitions works especially well against wrestlers who are comfortable defending single legs but less experienced with back control."
- **Eddie Bravo**: "From the 10th Planet perspective, the single leg to back take is beautiful because it turns a defensive situation into an offensive victory. We drill this constantly because it exemplifies our philosophy of always looking for the next attack even when the current one is being defended. The technique also connects perfectly with our back attack system and Twister setups. When teaching this, I emphasize the climbing motion - you're literally climbing up their body using their leg like a rope or ladder. The athletic, scrambling nature of this technique fits perfectly with our system's emphasis on dynamic position transitions and maintaining offensive pressure even during scrambles."

Each insight should focus on one key technical or strategic element.

### Common Errors
For knowledge test generation:
- **Error**: Releasing leg control before first hook is established
- **Why It Fails**: Opponent immediately turns to face you and defends back take
- **Correction**: Maintain tight leg control until near-side hook is completely secure
- **Recognition**: Opponent escaping and facing you during transition attempt

- **Error**: Fighting against opponent's rotation instead of following it
- **Why It Fails**: Creates resistance that prevents smooth transition and wastes energy
- **Correction**: Follow opponent's rotational movement fluidly and use it to climb
- **Recognition**: Feeling strong resistance and inability to progress toward back

- **Error**: Attempting to finish takedown instead of recognizing back opportunity
- **Why It Fails**: Wastes energy on low-percentage finish while missing high-value opportunity
- **Correction**: Develop recognition of when opponent's defense creates back exposure
- **Recognition**: Continuing to attempt failed takedown against strong defense

- **Error**: Poor climbing mechanics using only arm strength
- **Why It Fails**: Insufficient elevation to reach back position effectively
- **Correction**: Use leg as lever and climbing point with full body movement
- **Recognition**: Unable to climb high enough onto opponent's back for hook insertion

- **Error**: Slow hook insertion allowing opponent time to defend
- **Why It Fails**: Opponent recovers and prevents full back control establishment
- **Correction**: Insert first hook immediately upon reaching back position
- **Recognition**: Opponent turning into you or escaping before back control is complete

### Timing Considerations
When to attempt this transition:
- **Optimal Conditions**: When opponent rotates away or posts hands to defend takedown
- **Avoid When**: Opponent maintains square stance without rotation
- **Setup Sequences**: After opponent sprawls or establishes defensive position
- **Follow-up Windows**: Must complete back control within 4-6 seconds of initiating climb

### Prerequisites
Requirements before attempting:
- **Technical Skills**: Solid single leg control and basic back control fundamentals
- **Physical Preparation**: Core strength for climbing and hook insertion agility
