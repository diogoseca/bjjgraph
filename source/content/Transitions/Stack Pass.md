## Transition Description
The Stack Pass is a fundamental pressure-based guard passing technique where the passer drives forward, stacking the opponent's legs and hips toward their head while applying pressure to fold them into a compressed position. This pass relies on pressure, weight distribution, and strategic control to neutralize the opponent's hip mobility and guard retention capabilities. Unlike more movement-based passes, the Stack Pass employs a direct approach that uses gravity and forward pressure to break through the opponent's defensive structures. The technique is particularly effective against opponents with flexible guards and is a staple in both gi and no-gi contexts due to its mechanical efficiency and relative simplicity.

## Execution Steps
1. From top position, drive forward into opponent's guard, typically with shoulder pressure
2. Elevate opponent's hips by pushing their legs toward their head (creating the "stack")
3. Control opponent's legs, typically at the knees or ankles
4. Drive weight forward while maintaining pressure on opponent's lower body
5. Create an angle by stepping to one side as the guard breaks
6. Control opponent's hips to prevent recovery as you pass
7. Establish side control or mount with proper weight distribution
8. Secure upper body control to prevent defensive counters

## Key Grips/Controls
- Double ankle/shin control
- Direct pressure through shoulders and chest
- Hip control during final passing stage
- Collar control (in gi) to limit upper body mobility
- Head control to prevent defensive framing
- Pressure against opponent's diaphragm to limit breathing and mobility
- Knee positioning to block hip movement during transition

## Common Counters
- [[Hip Frame]] → [[Space Creation]]
- [[Technical Stand-up]] → [[Standing Guard]]
- [[Granby Roll]] → [[Inverted Guard]]
- [[Arm Frame]] → [[Guard Recovery]]
- [[Shoulder Walk]] → [[Distance Management]]

## Variants
- Double-ankle Stack Pass (traditional variation)
- Leg drag Stack Pass (combination technique)
- Over-under Stack Pass (with upper body control)
- Standing Stack Pass (from standing position)
- Knee-cut Stack Pass (combination technique)
- Single-side Stack Pass (asymmetrical pressure)
- Smash Pass Stack (pressure variation)
- Triple threat Stack (with submission threats)

## Expert Insights
- **Danaher System**: Emphasizes the Stack Pass as a primary example of the pressure passing principle, focusing on the mechanical efficiency of using gravity and weight distribution rather than speed or agility. Creates systematic approach to neutralizing defensive frames through strategic pressure points and incremental weight shifts, viewing the pass as a methodical progression of control points rather than a single movement.
- **Gordon Ryan**: Employs the Stack Pass extensively within his pressure passing system, particularly against flexible guard players. Emphasizes the importance of proper weight distribution and connection to prevent defensive movement, with particular focus on controlling the opponent's upper body to limit their ability to create frames during the stacking process.
- **Eddie Bravo**: Has adapted the Stack Pass principles for specific application against rubber guard and other 10th Planet positions, focusing on creating pressure that overcomes flexibility-based defenses. Emphasizes controlling the opponent's head and shoulders during the stack to prevent them from creating defensive angles.

## Timing Considerations
- Execute when opponent extends their legs
- Time with opponent's breathing patterns (execute during exhale)
- Perform after breaking opponent's grips
- Implement when opponent's hips are elevated
- Use when opponent commits to specific open guard configuration

## Follow-up Options
- [[Side Control Consolidation]] → [[Side Control]]
- [[Transition to Mount]] → [[Mount]]
- [[Kimura Trap]] → [[Kimura Control]]
- [[Back Step]] → [[Back Control]]
- [[Paper Cutter Choke]] → [[Won by Submission]]
- [[North-South Transition]] → [[North-South]]

## Common Errors
- Insufficient pressure → Re-guarding opportunity
- Poor weight distribution → Reduced effectiveness
- Improper angle during pass → Defensive frames
- Neglecting upper body control → Counter sweeps
- Premature transition → Position compromise
- Focusing solely on legs → Upper body defensive frames

## Computer Science Analogy
The Stack Pass represents a "resource exhaustion attack" in the BJJ state machine, where the opponent's defensive resources (hip mobility, breathing, and framing capabilities) are systematically depleted through sustained pressure. This implements a form of "denial of service" against the guard player's defensive algorithms by creating a scenario where physical constraints (gravity, weight, compression) overwhelm their ability to execute defensive patterns. The technique exemplifies the concept of a "brute force solution" that trades algorithmic elegance for raw mechanical efficiency, creating a high-probability path to the dominant state through direct application of physical principles.
