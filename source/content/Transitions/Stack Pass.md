## Transition Description
Stack Pass is a powerful offensive technique in Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu (BJJ) used to pass an opponent's guard, transitioning from a Closed Guard Top or Open Guard Top position to a dominant Side Control or Top Position. This technique involves stacking the opponent's legs over their head to control their hips and neutralize their guard, effectively bypassing their defensive barriers to achieve a controlling top position. It is particularly effective against flexible or defensive guard players, embodying the BJJ principle of pressure application and control to dominate from the top. Stack Pass is a key strategy in both gi and no-gi grappling, offering a high-percentage method to overcome guard defenses and establish positional dominance.

## Visual Execution Sequence
Detailed description for clear visualization of the transition in action:

Starting from a Closed Guard Top or Open Guard Top position, you are on top of your opponent who is on their back with their legs engaged around you, attempting to control or attack from their guard, as you remain alert for their movements and grip opportunities while maintaining a strong posture with your hands on their hips or gripping their pants in gi or controlling their wrists in no-gi. As you initiate the Stack Pass, you drive forward with your weight, stepping one leg up to break their closed guard if necessary, or moving into their open guard space, beginning to lift their hips by underhooking both of their legs near the knees or ankles, ensuring your shoulders and chest are positioned to apply pressure forward and upward to start stacking their legs over their head. You continue to drive your weight forward, feeling their guard resistance weaken as their hips elevate and their legs are forced toward their shoulders, using your head to post on their stomach or chest if needed for balance, with your knees bent and base low to maintain control and prevent sweeps. With precise timing, you keep your arms locked around their legs to maintain the stack, sensing their reaction as they either try to push back with their legs, attempt a sweep, or defend their neck against potential submissions like a can opener, while you adjust your angle slightly to the side to prepare for the pass completion. Mid-transition, you maintain relentless forward pressure to keep their legs stacked, stepping to one side with your knee to clear their guard frame or leg barrier, as you position yourself to transition into Side Control by sliding your body around their legs or directly into a Top Position if they manage to unstack but remain vulnerable. You complete the Stack Pass by securing Side Control, establishing a crossface and underhook to pin their upper body, or settling into a stable Top Position if the pass lands you higher, having successfully bypassed their guard with heavy pressure. Throughout the movement, you remain aware of their defensive responses like hip escapes, grip breaks, or submission attempts, adjusting your weight distribution, grip tightness, and knee positioning to counter their efforts, demonstrating an effective offensive technique that establishes dominance over their guard.

**Template**: "From Closed Guard Top or Open Guard Top, on top of opponent on their back with legs engaged in guard, attempting control or attack, alert for movements and grip opportunities, maintaining strong posture with hands on hips or gripping pants in gi or wrists in no-gi. Initiate Stack Pass by driving forward with weight, step one leg up to break closed guard if necessary or move into open guard space, lift hips by underhooking both legs near knees or ankles, apply pressure forward and upward with shoulders and chest to stack legs over head. Drive weight forward, weaken guard resistance as hips elevate and legs force toward shoulders, use head to post on stomach or chest for balance if needed, keep knees bent and base low for control and sweep prevention. Maintain arms locked around legs for stack, sense reaction as they push back with legs, attempt sweep, or defend neck against submissions, adjust angle slightly to side for pass completion. Maintain relentless forward pressure mid-transition to keep legs stacked, step to side with knee to clear guard frame or leg barrier, position for Side Control by sliding body around legs or Top Position if they unstack but remain vulnerable. Complete Stack Pass by securing Side Control with crossface and underhook to pin upper body, or settle into stable Top Position if pass lands higher, bypass guard with heavy pressure. Stay aware of defensive responses like hip escapes, grip breaks, or submission attempts, adjust weight distribution, grip tightness, knee positioning to counter, establish dominance over guard."

## Execution Steps
1. Begin in a Closed Guard Top or Open Guard Top position, maintaining awareness of the opponent's guard movements and identifying an opportunity to initiate a pass while keeping a strong posture.
2. Drive forward with your weight, stepping one leg up to break their closed guard if necessary, or moving into their open guard space to start the pass.
3. Lift their hips by underhooking both of their legs near the knees or ankles, using your shoulders and chest to apply pressure forward and upward to stack their legs over their head.
4. Continue driving your weight forward to elevate their hips further, using your head to post on their stomach or chest for balance if needed, while keeping your base low to prevent sweeps.
5. Maintain your arms locked around their legs to sustain the stack, adjusting your angle slightly to the side to prepare for completing the pass, while monitoring their defensive reactions.
6. Step to one side with your knee to clear their guard frame or leg barrier, maintaining forward pressure to keep their legs stacked as you slide your body around to transition into Side Control or settle into a Top Position.
7. Complete the Stack Pass by securing Side Control with a crossface and underhook to control their upper body, or establishing a stable Top Position if the pass lands higher.
8. Remain aware of their defensive responses like hip escapes or submission attempts, adapting your weight distribution, grip tightness, and positioning to consolidate the pass and maintain dominance.

## Key Details

## Common Counters and Counter-Attacks
Analysis of opponent responses with success rates for counter-attacks:
- **Hip Escape** → [[Guard Recovery]] (Success Rate: 30%, Conditions: opponent creates space to recover guard)
- **Posture Break** → [[Closed Guard Bottom]] (Success Rate: 25%, Conditions: opponent pulls posture down to disrupt stack)
- **Sweep Attempt** → [[Bottom Position]] (Success Rate: 20%, Conditions: opponent uses stack momentum for sweep)
- **Submission Counter** → [[Triangle Choke Front]] (Success Rate: 15%, Conditions: opponent catches legs or neck during stack)
- **Grip Break** → [[Open Guard Bottom]] (Success Rate: 10%, Conditions: opponent breaks leg control to reset guard)

## Decision Logic for Transition
```
If [opponent's guard] is vulnerable with hips accessible:
- Initiate [[Stack Pass]] to bypass guard (Probability: 65%)

Else if [scramble situation] offers stacking opportunity:
- Execute [[Stack Pass]] for positional dominance (Probability: 60%)

Else if [personal strategy] favors pressure passing over speed:
- Attempt [[Stack Pass]] to control opponent (Probability: 55%)

Else if [opponent defends] with strong posture break or hip escape mid-pass:
- Adjust to [[Knee Cut Pass]] for alternative pass (Probability: 45%)

Else if [pass fails] due to successful defense or submission threat:
- Transition to [[Neutral Position]] to reset (Probability: 35%)
```

## Common Errors
For knowledge test generation and error correction:
- **Error**: Insufficient forward pressure or weak stack
- **Why It Fails**: Allows opponent to maintain guard or create space before pass completion
- **Correction**: Drive weight forward relentlessly and secure legs over head for stack
- **Recognition**: Opponent's hips remain low or guard stays active

- **Error**: High base or unstable posture
- **Why It Fails**: Leaves you vulnerable to sweeps or loss of balance during pass
- **Correction**: Keep knees bent and base low, post head if needed for stability
- **Recognition**: Feeling off-balance or opponent initiates sweep

- **Error**: Poor leg control or grip release
- **Why It Fails**: Allows opponent to unstack or recover guard without resistance
- **Correction**: Maintain tight underhooks on legs to sustain stack until pass is complete
- **Recognition**: Opponent easily pulls legs back down or escapes
