## Transition Description
Standing to Single Leg X is an advanced offensive technique in Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu (BJJ) used to transition from a standing or neutral position into a dominant guard configuration, specifically targeting the Single Leg X Guard or a general Guard Position. This technique involves dropping down to the mat while entangling one of the opponent's legs to establish a strong offensive guard platform, effectively shifting the fight to the ground on your terms. It is particularly effective against standing opponents who are unprepared for leg entanglements, embodying the BJJ principle of guard pulling and control to initiate attacks from the bottom. Standing to Single Leg X is a key strategy in both gi and no-gi grappling, offering a dynamic method to enter a guard with significant sweep and submission potential.

## Visual Execution Sequence
Detailed description for clear visualization of the transition in action:

Starting from a Standing Position or Neutral Position, you face your opponent who is also standing, maintaining a low stance with your hands ready to engage their upper body or defend against takedowns, as you remain alert for their movements and balance while looking for an opportunity to target one of their legs. As you initiate the Standing to Single Leg X transition, you feint or engage their upper body with a grip on their collar or wrist to distract them, then quickly drop your level by bending your knees and sitting back toward the mat, simultaneously reaching for one of their legs near the knee or ankle with both hands to begin the entanglement. You pull their leg toward you as you sit, feeling their balance shift as they react to your sudden drop, using your legs to guide their targeted leg across your hip or thigh while your other leg hooks behind their knee or shin to secure the Single Leg X configuration, with your upper body angled to maintain control and prevent them from stepping back. With precise timing, you lock your legs into position, one foot on their hip to control distance and the other hooking their leg to prevent escape, sensing their reaction as they either try to pull their leg free, posture up to resist, or attempt a counter pass, while you adjust your grip on their leg to tighten the entanglement. Mid-transition, you maintain active hip movement to off-balance them, keeping your legs engaged to prevent them from stepping out of the guard, as you position yourself to fully establish Single Leg X Guard by securing their leg tightly against your shoulder or transition to a general Guard Position if they manage to partially escape. You complete the Standing to Single Leg X by locking in the guard, using your hips to create angles for sweeps or submissions, having successfully pulled them into your offensive guard platform. Throughout the movement, you remain aware of their attempts to counter with passes, takedowns, or leg locks, adjusting your grip strength, leg positioning, and hip angle to counter their responses, demonstrating an effective offensive technique that shifts the fight to your domain on the ground.

**Template**: "From Standing Position or Neutral Position, facing opponent also standing, maintain low stance with hands ready to engage upper body or defend takedowns, alert for movements and balance, look for opportunity to target one leg. Initiate Standing to Single Leg X by feinting or engaging upper body with grip on collar or wrist to distract, drop level by bending knees and sitting back to mat, reach for one leg near knee or ankle with both hands to begin entanglement. Pull leg toward you as you sit, shift their balance as they react to drop, guide targeted leg across hip or thigh with your legs, hook other leg behind knee or shin to secure Single Leg X, angle upper body to maintain control and prevent step-back. Lock legs into position with one foot on hip for distance and other hooking leg to prevent escape, sense reaction as they pull leg free, posture up, or counter pass, adjust grip on leg to tighten entanglement. Maintain active hip movement mid-transition to off-balance, keep legs engaged to prevent stepping out of guard, position for Single Leg X Guard by securing leg against shoulder or general Guard Position if they partially escape. Complete Standing to Single Leg X by locking in guard, use hips to create angles for sweeps or submissions, pull them into offensive guard platform. Stay aware of counters with passes, takedowns, or leg locks, adjust grip strength, leg positioning, hip angle to counter, shift fight to your domain on ground."

## Execution Steps
1. Begin in a Standing Position or Neutral Position, maintaining awareness of the opponent's stance and balance, identifying an opportunity to target one of their legs while keeping a low defensive posture.
2. Feint or engage their upper body with a grip on their collar or wrist to distract them, preparing to drop your level for the guard entry.
3. Drop down by bending your knees and sitting back toward the mat, simultaneously reaching for one of their legs near the knee or ankle with both hands to start the entanglement.
4. Pull their leg toward you as you sit, guiding it across your hip or thigh with one leg while hooking behind their knee or shin with your other leg to secure the Single Leg X configuration.
5. Lock your legs into position, placing one foot on their hip to control distance and the other hooking their leg to prevent escape, while angling your upper body to maintain control.
6. Maintain active hip movement during the transition to off-balance them, adjusting your grip on their leg to tighten the entanglement and prevent them from stepping out.
7. Complete the Standing to Single Leg X by fully establishing Single Leg X Guard, securing their leg tightly against your shoulder, or transitioning to a general Guard Position if they partially escape.
8. Remain aware of their counter responses like pulling their leg free or attempting passes, adapting your leg positioning, hip angle, and grip strength to consolidate the guard and prepare for attacks.

## Key Details
- **Level Drop**: Essential to quickly sit back to mat for guard entry.
- **Leg Targeting**: Secure one leg near knee or ankle for entanglement.
- **Leg Positioning**: Guide leg across hip, hook behind knee for control.
- **Foot Placement**: One foot on hip for distance, other hooks leg to lock.
- **Hip Mobility**: Active hips to off-balance and create attack angles.
- **Upper Body Angle**: Angle torso to maintain control and prevent escape.
- **Grip Strength**: Strong grip on leg to sustain entanglement.
- **Offensive Awareness**: Monitor for counters or defensive reactions.

## Success Modifiers
Factors that influence the success rate of the transition:
- **Timing Precision**: Dropping at optimal moment of opponent imbalance (+10%)
- **Leg Control Strength**: Secure grip to initiate entanglement (+8%)
- **Hip Mobility**: Active movement to off-balance and lock guard (+7%)
- **Distraction Effectiveness**: Feint or grip to divert opponent focus (+5%)
- **Experience Level**: Familiarity with guard entry mechanics (+5% per skill level)

## Common Counters and Counter-Attacks
Analysis of opponent responses with success rates for counter-attacks:
- **Leg Pullback** → [[Neutral Position]] (Success Rate: 30%, Conditions: opponent pulls leg free before entanglement)
- **Guard Pass** → [[Side Control]] (Success Rate: 25%, Conditions: opponent steps around to pass during drop)
- **Takedown Counter** → [[Top Position]] (Success Rate: 20%, Conditions: opponent capitalizes on drop for takedown)
- **Leg Lock Attempt** → [[Kneebar Control]] (Success Rate: 15%, Conditions: opponent attacks exposed leg during entry)
- **Posture Control** → [[Standing Guard]] (Success Rate: 10%, Conditions: opponent maintains posture to resist guard pull)

## Decision Logic for Transition
```
If [opponent's stance] is vulnerable with one leg forward:
- Initiate [[Standing to Single Leg X]] to enter guard (Probability: 60%)

Else if [scramble situation] offers guard entry opportunity:
- Execute [[Standing to Single Leg X]] for offensive platform (Probability: 55%)

Else if [personal strategy] favors ground control over standing:
- Attempt [[Standing to Single Leg X]] to shift fight (Probability: 50%)

Else if [opponent counters] with strong leg pullback or pass mid-entry:
- Adjust to [[Guard Pull]] for alternative guard (Probability: 40%)

Else if [entry fails] due to successful counter or takedown threat:
- Transition to [[Defensive Position]] to mitigate (Probability: 30%)
```
