## Technique Description
The Old School Sweep is a fundamental half guard sweeping technique that utilizes leverage, timing, and proper gripping to reverse position from bottom half guard to a dominant top position. It centers around controlling the opponent's upper body with an underhook while simultaneously capturing their far leg, creating a powerful mechanical advantage that allows the bottom player to elevate and sweep the opponent. The technique's effectiveness stems from its ability to manipulate the opponent's base by controlling two diagonal corners of their body. Despite its simplicity, the Old School Sweep remains one of the highest-percentage techniques even at the highest levels of competition due to its solid mechanical foundation and the fact that it addresses the critical problem of transitioning from an inferior half guard bottom position to a dominant top position.

## Execution Steps
1. From [[Half Guard Bottom]], secure a strong underhook with your arm on the side where you're trapping the opponent's leg
2. Use your underhook to turn toward the opponent and bring your outside leg (the one not involved in the half guard) up and over to hook behind the opponent's far leg near the knee/hamstring area
3. Reach with your non-underhooking arm to grip the opponent's ankle or pants on the same far leg
4. Keep your head tight to the opponent's chest to prevent crossfacing and maintain the underhook
5. Bridge your hips upward while pulling the trapped far leg toward you
6. Use this momentum to roll your opponent over as you come to your knees and secure top position
7. Complete the sweep by establishing either [[Top Half Guard]] or [[Side Control]] depending on your opponent's resistance

## Key Details
- **Underhook Depth**: The underhook must be deep, ideally with your hand reaching the opponent's far lat muscle
- **Head Position**: Keep your head tight to opponent's chest or shoulder to prevent crossface
- **Hip Movement**: Initial hip escape away before bridging creates better angle for the sweep
- **Leg Hook Placement**: Your outside leg must hook behind opponent's knee or hamstring, not too high on the thigh
- **Timing**: Execute when opponent's weight shifts forward toward your upper body
- **Far Leg Grip**: Control must be established on ankle or pants before initiating the sweeping motion
- **Direction of Force**: Bridge at approximately 45-degree angle, not straight up
- **Follow-Through**: Continue the sweeping motion until fully established in top position

## Common Defenses
- [[Crossface Prevention]] → [[Knee Shield Half Guard]]
- [[Base Widening]] → [[Return to Half Guard Bottom]]
- [[Far Leg Retraction]] → [[Deep Half Guard]]
- [[Whizzer Application]] → [[Half Guard Bottom]]
- [[Forward Pressure]] → [[Flattened Half Guard]]

## Counter Techniques
- [[Backstep Pass]] - When opponent feels sweep starting they backstep to counter
- [[Knee Cut Response]] - Opponent drives knee through to prevent sweep momentum
- [[Switch Base]] - Opponent changes base direction to negate sweep mechanics
- [[Whizzer and Granby]] - Opponent applies whizzer and inverts to counter
- [[Crossface and Flatten]] - Opponent establishes strong crossface to deny underhook

## Variations
- Deep Half Old School - Executed from [[Deep Half Guard]] with enhanced leverage
- No-Gi Old School - Using head position and body lock instead of gi grips
- Electric Chair Combo - Combination with [[Electric Chair]] if opponent defends initially
- Double Leg Old School - Gripping both legs during the sweep for greater control
- Single Motion Old School - Executing the entire sweep in one fluid movement rather than stages

## Setup Opportunities
- [[Underhook Battle Win]] → [[Old School Sweep]]
- [[Failed Knee Shield]] → [[Old School Sweep]]
- [[Deep Half Entry]] → [[Old School Sweep]]
- [[Opponent Forward Pressure]] → [[Old School Sweep]]
- [[Lockdown to Half Guard]] → [[Old School Sweep]]

## Follow-up Options
- [[Side Control Consolidation]] (if landed in side control)
- [[Knee on Belly Transition]] (to increase positional value)
- [[Mount Transition]] (for highest positional value)
- [[Kimura From Top Half]] (if opponent defends the pass)
- [[Backtake from Top Half]] (if opponent turns away)
- [[Leg Drag Sequence]] (if opponent attempts to reguard)

## Expert Insights
- **Danaher System**: Emphasizes the importance of controlling the opponent's far leg and preventing defensive framing. Danaher teaches the Old School as part of a comprehensive "inside position" half guard system, where the underhook battle determines primary tactical options. He focuses on precise weight distribution and head positioning to make the sweep mechanically optimal.
- **Gordon Ryan**: Executes the Old School with exceptional timing, often using it as part of a larger sweep combination sequence. Ryan emphasizes creating a reaction with initial movements before committing to the sweep, often transitioning between the Old School and other half guard sweeps to exploit defensive reactions.
- **Eddie Bravo**: Incorporates the Old School into his 10th Planet system, often connecting it with the Lockdown and Electric Chair sequence. Bravo's approach emphasizes controlling the opponent's posture before initiating the sweep and connecting it with submission attacks if the opponent defends incorrectly.

## Common Errors
- Insufficient underhook depth → Unable to control opponent's upper body
- Poor head positioning → Vulnerability to crossface
- Premature bridge attempt → Lack of mechanical advantage
- Improper leg hook placement → Reduced leverage
- Failure to control far leg → Opponent can base out
- Telegraphing sweep intention → Early defensive reaction
- Incomplete follow-through → Return to half guard

## Strategic Application
- Primary offensive option from half guard bottom position
- Counter to opponent's pressure-passing approach
- First option in the underhook half guard attacking sequence
- Connection between half guard and dominant top position
- Foundational sweep that sets up more advanced options
- High-percentage competition technique that addresses positional disadvantage

## Training Approaches
- Isolated drilling with cooperative partner focusing on mechanics
- Progressive resistance drills with increasing defensive intensity
- Sweep-to-submission combination drilling
- Live situational sparring from half guard bottom
- Reaction training against common defensive responses
- Timing development with movement-based entries

## Competition Effectiveness
The Old School Sweep remains one of the highest-percentage half guard sweeps in competition across all levels, from local tournaments to ADCC and IBJJF Worlds. Its effectiveness stems from its solid mechanical foundation and versatility across rule sets and scenarios. The technique is particularly effective in no-gi competition where the lack of friction can make it even more explosive. Statistics from high-level competitions show approximately 60-70% success rate when properly set up, with effectiveness increasing when incorporated into a broader half guard sweeping system rather than used in isolation. The technique's reliability makes it a cornerstone of many world champions' half guard arsenals.

## Historical Development
The Old School Sweep has been a fundamental part of BJJ since at least the 1980s, but received its common name through the popularization by American grappler Eddie Bravo who learned it from his instructor Jean Jacques Machado. The sweep itself likely evolved from earlier judo and wrestling transitions, but was specifically refined within the context of BJJ's half guard position. While the core mechanics have remained consistent, the technical details have evolved with modern iterations focusing more on specific gripping strategies and combination approaches. The sweep gained wider recognition when it became a central component of the modern half guard game developed by competitors like Bernardo Faria, Lucas Leite, and later Gordon Ryan, who all used variations of the Old School Sweep as a cornerstone of their successful competitive approaches.

## Conceptual Relationship to Computer Science
The Old School Sweep functions as an optimal "state transition function" in the BJJ positional hierarchy, efficiently moving the practitioner from a negative value state (bottom half guard) to a positive value state (top position) with minimal intermediate steps. This represents a form of "greedy algorithm" that seeks the most direct path to improvement rather than a series of incremental optimizations. The technique also demonstrates principles of mechanical leverage similar to how multiplexers in digital circuits can use a small input signal to control a much larger output—the properly applied underhook and leg hook create a mechanical multiplier effect that allows a smaller practitioner to move a larger opponent through superior positioning rather than strength.
