## Transition Description
The Old School Sweep is a fundamental offensive technique in Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu (BJJ) used to transition from the bottom position in Closed Guard to a dominant top position like Mount or a general Top Position. This sweep involves trapping one of the opponent's arms and legs on the same side, then using hip movement and leverage to roll them over, reversing the position. It is particularly effective against opponents who posture up in guard or overcommit their weight, embodying the BJJ principle of using timing and body mechanics to overcome a stronger or larger opponent. The Old School Sweep is a staple in both gi and no-gi grappling, offering a high-percentage reversal that is accessible to practitioners of all levels.

## Visual Execution Sequence
Detailed description for clear visualization of the transition in action:

Starting in bottom Closed Guard, you are on your back with your legs wrapped around your opponent's torso, feet locked behind their back, while they are on their knees, posturing up with their hands on your hips or gripping your gi to control your movement and prevent submissions. To initiate the Old School Sweep, you first break their posture by pulling with your legs and gripping their right sleeve with your left hand, trapping their right arm against your chest, while reaching over their back with your right arm to secure a grip on their right tricep or lat, preparing to isolate their right side for the sweep. You then plant your left foot on the mat, keeping your right leg tight around their torso to maintain guard control, as you angle your hips slightly to your left, creating space to trap their right leg by hooking your left foot inside their right knee, feeling their balance shift as you limit their base on that side. With precise timing, you pull their trapped right arm across your body to your left, using your right arm grip to keep their upper body close, while driving off your left foot to explode your hips upward and to the left, initiating the roll, sensing their weight begin to topple as their trapped side collapses under the leverage. Mid-sweep, you maintain control of their right arm and leg, keeping your left foot hooked inside their right knee to prevent them from stepping out, as you continue to drive your hips through the motion, rolling them onto their back while following their movement to stay tight, ensuring they cannot posture or escape during the transition. You complete the sweep by landing in Mount on top of them, with your knees pinching their hips, securing their trapped right arm under your control, or transitioning to a general Top Position if they manage to open their legs, having successfully reversed the position with a classic sweep. Throughout the movement, you remain aware of their attempts to posture or pull their arm free, adjusting your grips and hip pressure to counter their defenses, demonstrating an effective offensive reversal technique that transforms a defensive guard position into dominant top control in a calculated, leverage-driven sequence.

**Template**: "From bottom Closed Guard, on back, legs wrapped around opponent’s torso, feet locked behind back, opponent on knees, posturing up, hands on hips or gripping gi for control. Break posture, pull with legs, grip right sleeve with left hand, trap right arm to chest, reach over back with right arm for right tricep or lat grip, isolate right side for sweep. Plant left foot on mat, keep right leg tight for guard control, angle hips left, create space to trap right leg, hook left foot inside right knee, shift their balance. Pull trapped right arm across to left, keep upper body close with right arm grip, drive off left foot, explode hips up and left, initiate roll, topple their weight. Maintain control of right arm and leg mid-sweep, keep left foot hooked inside right knee to block step-out, drive hips through, roll them to back, follow tight to prevent escape. Land in Mount on top, knees pinching hips, secure trapped right arm, or transition to Top Position if legs open, reverse position with classic sweep. Stay aware of posture or arm-freeing attempts, adjust grips and hip pressure to counter, transform defensive guard into dominant top control with calculated leverage."

## Execution Steps
1. Begin in bottom Closed Guard, recognizing the opportunity to sweep when the opponent postures up or overcommits their weight forward, making their balance vulnerable.
2. Break their posture by pulling down with your legs, using your core to disrupt their base, while gripping their sleeve on one side with your opposite hand to trap their arm against your chest.
3. Reach over their back with your free arm to secure a grip on their tricep or lat on the trapped arm side, isolating that side of their body for the sweep.
4. Plant your foot on the mat on the same side as your trapping hand, angling your hips to create space, and hook that foot inside their knee on the trapped side to limit their base and mobility.
5. Pull their trapped arm across your body to the opposite side, maintaining the upper body grip to keep them close, as you drive off your planted foot to explode your hips upward and toward the trapped side, initiating the roll.
6. Maintain control of their trapped arm and leg mid-sweep, keeping your hooking foot inside their knee to prevent them from stepping out, while continuing to drive your hips through the motion to roll them onto their back.
7. Follow their movement tightly to land on top in Mount, pinching your knees around their hips and securing their trapped arm, or adjust to a general Top Position if their legs open during the transition.
8. Remain aware of their defensive attempts like posturing or freeing their arm, adjusting your grips, hip pressure, and body angle to counter and consolidate the dominant top position.

## Key Details

- **Arm Trapping**: Trap one arm against chest to isolate side and limit defensive posting.
- **Upper Body Grip**: Secure tricep or lat grip to keep opponent’s torso close during roll.
- **Leg Trapping**: Hook foot inside opponent’s knee on trapped side to block base.
- **Hip Explosion**: Drive hips upward and to trapped side for powerful sweep initiation.
- **Control Maintenance**: Keep arm and leg trapped mid-sweep to prevent escape or counter.
- **Tight Follow-Through**: Stay close during roll to land in control on top.
- **Positional Awareness**: Adjust to Mount or Top Position based on opponent’s leg reaction.
