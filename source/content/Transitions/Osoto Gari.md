## State Machine Content Elements

### Visual Execution Sequence
Detailed step-by-step description for clear movement sequence visualization:

From standing position with collar and sleeve control, you step close to your opponent placing your right foot next to their right foot. Your opponent typically maintains their stance or attempts to counter-grip. You then lift them slightly with your grips while simultaneously reaping their right leg with your right leg in a large circular motion, sweeping their leg out from under them. The combination of lift and leg reap causes them to fall backward as you follow through, landing in a dominant top position with control established.

**Template**: "From standing with collar-sleeve grips, you step close and reap their leg with a large circular motion while lifting with your grips. Your opponent falls backward as you follow through to top position."

### Execution Steps (Numbered Sequence)
1. **Setup Requirements**: Establish strong collar and sleeve grips from standing position
2. **Initial Movement**: Step your right foot close to opponent's right foot (outside position)
3. **Opponent Response**: Opponent typically maintains stance or attempts defensive grips
4. **Adaptation**: Adjust grip tension and body position based on their resistance
5. **Completion**: Lift with grips while reaping their leg in large circular motion
6. **Consolidation**: Follow through to land in dominant top position

### Key Technical Details
Critical elements that determine success:
- **Grip Requirements**: Strong collar grip with one hand, sleeve control with other
- **Base/Foundation**: Proper foot placement close to opponent's foot
- **Timing Windows**: Execute when opponent's weight is on the targeted leg
- **Leverage Points**: Lifting action combined with leg reap creates mechanical advantage
- **Common Adjustments**: Vary reaping angle and lifting direction based on resistance

### Success Modifiers
Factors that increase/decrease probability:
- **Setup Quality**: Strong grips and proper foot positioning (+/-15%)
- **Timing Precision**: Executing when opponent's weight is committed (+/-20%)
- **Opponent Fatigue**: Reduced defensive reactions and balance (+/-5%)
- **Knowledge Test Performance**: Understanding throw mechanics (+/-10%)
- **Position Control**: Quality of initial grip establishment (+/-10%)

## Counter-Attack Analysis

### Common Counters
Opponent responses with success rates:
- **Sprawl Defense**: Dropping hips back to avoid the reap → [[Standing Position]] (Success Rate: 45%, Conditions: early recognition)
- **Counter Throw**: Using opponent's momentum for counter-attack → [[Top Position]] (Success Rate: 35%, Conditions: superior timing)
- **Underhook Defense**: Creating frames to prevent close contact → [[Clinch Position]] (Success Rate: 50%, Conditions: grip fighting)
- **Circle Away**: Moving in direction opposite to reap → [[Standing Position]] (Success Rate: 40%, Conditions: mobility)

Format: `[[Counter Technique]] → [[Result State]] (Success Rate: X%, Conditions: [when applicable])`

### Decision Logic
```
If [grip setup quality] < 50%:
- Execute [[Underhook Defense]] (Probability: 50%)

Else if [throw timing] is telegraphed:
- Execute [[Sprawl Defense]] (Probability: 45%)

Else if [opponent has superior position]:
- Execute [[Counter Throw]] (Probability: 35%)

Else [optimal throw execution]:
- Accept transition (Probability: Success Rate - Modifiers)
```

## Educational Content

### Expert Insights
Commentary as if from recognized authorities:
- **John Danaher**: "Osoto gari succeeds through the combination of lifting and reaping actions working in perfect coordination. The key is understanding that the leg reap alone is insufficient - you must lift your opponent's center of gravity while simultaneously removing their base. The throw teaches fundamental principles of off-balancing that apply throughout grappling."
- **Gordon Ryan**: "In no-gi competition, osoto gari is particularly effective because it doesn't rely on traditional gi grips. I use it when opponents are defensive in the standing position, as it creates immediate ground engagement where I can implement my ground game advantages. The follow-through to top position is crucial for maintaining dominance."
- **Eddie Bravo**: "Osoto gari integrates well with rubber guard entries and other unconventional attacks. When the throw is partially defended, it often creates scramble situations that favor creative grapplers. The technique can be modified for different grip configurations and combined with other takedown attempts."

Each insight should focus on one key technical or strategic element.

### Common Errors
For knowledge test generation:
- **Error**: Attempting to reap without proper lifting action
- **Why It Fails**: Leg reap alone is insufficient to overcome opponent's balance
- **Correction**: Coordinate lifting with grips and leg reap simultaneously
- **Recognition**: Opponent easily maintains balance despite leg contact

- **Error**: Poor foot placement too far from opponent
- **Why It Fails**: Reduces power and leverage of the reaping action
- **Correction**: Step close with foot placement next to opponent's foot
- **Recognition**: Feeling weak or ineffective during reap attempt

- **Error**: Telegraphing the throw with obvious preparation
- **Why It Fails**: Gives opponent time to prepare defensive counter-measures
- **Correction**: Maintain normal grip fighting appearance until execution
- **Recognition**: Opponent easily anticipates and defends the attack

### Timing Considerations
When to attempt this transition:
- **Optimal Conditions**: When opponent's weight is committed to targeted leg
- **Avoid When**: Opponent is mobile and constantly changing stance
- **Setup Sequences**: After failed grip attempts that bring opponent forward
- **Follow-up Windows**: Must complete follow-through within 1-2 seconds

### Prerequisites
Requirements before attempting:
- **Technical Skills**: Basic standing grip fighting and balance understanding
- **Physical Preparation**: Leg strength and coordination for reaping motion
- **Positional Understanding**: Standing position mechanics and off-balancing principles
- **Experience Level**: Intermediate technique requiring timing and coordination
