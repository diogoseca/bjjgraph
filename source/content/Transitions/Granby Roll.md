## Transition Description
The Granby Roll is an advanced defensive movement in Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu (BJJ) that involves an inverted shoulder roll to escape from disadvantageous positions such as Turtle or Side Control. This technique leverages inversion and rotational momentum to reorient the practitioner from a defensive posture to a position where they can regain guard or initiate a scramble. It is particularly effective against opponents attempting to control or attack the back, as it allows the defender to face the opponent again while potentially setting up offensive opportunities. The Granby Roll embodies the BJJ principle of fluidity, enabling practitioners to escape dominant positions through dynamic movement rather than brute strength.

## Visual Execution Sequence
Detailed description for clear visualization of the transition in action:

Starting in Turtle Position, you are on your knees and elbows, with your opponent positioned to your right side, applying pressure with their chest on your back and hands gripping around your waist, attempting to secure hooks for back control. Sensing the threat, you initiate the Granby Roll by tucking your chin to your chest for safety and shifting your weight onto your right shoulder, preparing to invert over your left shoulder towards open space on your left side. You kick your right leg high over your left shoulder, driving with your left leg to generate momentum, as your body begins to roll inverted, with your opponent’s grip loosening due to the sudden directional change. Mid-roll, your hips elevate off the mat, and you maintain a tight, compact form, keeping your arms close to protect against submissions, while your head and shoulder slide across the mat, completing the inversion as you rotate 180 degrees. Landing on your back or left hip, you immediately post with your left hand to establish a base, turning to face your opponent who is now in front of you, having lost their dominant angle during your roll. You quickly assess their posture, potentially pulling guard by inserting your legs between you and them, or scrambling to a neutral position, capitalizing on the momentary disorientation caused by the roll. Throughout the movement, spatial awareness is critical, ensuring you roll away from your opponent’s pressure into open space, successfully escaping the back threat with a dynamic, inverted shoulder roll that showcases advanced defensive movement in a high-risk scenario.

**Template**: "From Turtle Position, on knees and elbows, opponent on right applying back pressure, tuck chin, shift weight to right shoulder for inversion over left shoulder to open space. Kick right leg high over left shoulder, drive with left leg for momentum, roll inverted, loosening opponent’s grip. Elevate hips mid-roll, keep form tight, arms close for protection, head and shoulder sliding across mat, completing 180-degree rotation. Land on back or left hip, post left hand for base, turn to face opponent now in front, having lost dominant angle. Assess posture, pull guard or scramble to neutral, capitalizing on disorientation. Maintain spatial awareness, roll away from pressure into open space, escape back threat with dynamic inverted shoulder roll, showcasing advanced defense."

## Execution Steps
1. Identify the appropriate scenario for a Granby Roll, such as defending from Turtle Position against back control attempts or escaping Side Control pressure.
2. Shift your weight onto the shoulder opposite the direction of the roll, preparing to invert over the other shoulder towards open space.
3. Tuck your chin to your chest to protect your neck during the inversion, minimizing the risk of strain or impact injury.
4. Kick the leg on the rolling side high over the opposite shoulder while driving with the other leg to generate rotational momentum for the inversion.
5. Roll inverted over your shoulder, maintaining a tight, compact body position to protect against submissions and ensure a smooth rotation.
6. Complete the 180-degree rotation, landing on your back or hip, and immediately post with a hand to establish a base for stability.
7. Turn to face your opponent, who should now be in front of you, having lost their dominant control angle during the roll.
8. Assess the situation and transition to Guard Position, Neutral Position, or Scramble Position, capitalizing on the opponent’s momentary disorientation.

## Key Details
- **Inversion Direction**: Roll over the shoulder towards open space, away from opponent’s pressure.
- **Neck Protection**: Tuck chin to chest to safeguard against strain or injury during inversion.
- **Leg Drive**: Use a high kick and strong push to generate necessary rotational momentum.
- **Compact Form**: Keep body tight during roll to minimize exposure to attacks.
- **Shoulder Contact**: Maintain shoulder-to-mat contact for controlled inversion rather than head or neck.
- **Spatial Orientation**: Be aware of landing position to quickly face opponent post-roll.
- **Base Establishment**: Post hand immediately after roll to prevent being flattened or controlled.
- **Momentum Continuation**: Use roll’s energy to transition directly into guard or scramble.

## Common Counters and Counter-Attacks
Analysis of opponent responses with success rates for counter-attacks:
- **Back Take Attempt** → [[Back Control]] (Success Rate: 55%, Conditions: opponent anticipates roll and shifts to secure hooks mid-inversion)
- **Pressure Adjustment** → [[Side Control]] (Success Rate: 50%, Conditions: opponent drives weight forward to pin during roll attempt)
- **Grip Retention** → [[Turtle Position]] (Success Rate: 45%, Conditions: opponent maintains waist grip to block full rotation)
- **Submission Setup** → [[Armbar Control]] (Success Rate: 40%, Conditions: opponent targets exposed arm during roll)
- **Scramble Counter** → [[Top Position]] (Success Rate: 35%, Conditions: opponent capitalizes on post-roll scramble to gain top control)

## Decision Logic for Transition
```
If [back control threat] is imminent from Turtle Position:
- Initiate [[Granby Roll]] to escape (Probability: 75%)

Else if [side control pressure] restricts movement:
- Execute [[Granby Roll]] to Guard Position (Probability: 70%)

Else if [inverted guard] offers roll opportunity:
- Attempt [[Granby Roll]] to Neutral Position (Probability: 65%)

Else if [opponent counters] with grip or back take mid-roll:
- Adjust to [[Turtle Position]] for defense (Probability: 55%)

Else if [roll fails] due to insufficient momentum or space:
- Reinforce [[Defensive Posture]] to prevent submission (Probability: 50%)
```

Its success hinges on precise timing and spatial awareness, teaching practitioners to exploit transitional windows to prevent dominant control."
- **Gordon Ryan**: "I rely on the Granby Roll as a high-percentage escape from turtle and side control, particularly against aggressive back-takers. The key is maintaining shoulder contact and using leg drive to ensure a complete rotation, often chaining it into an immediate guard pull or offensive scramble."
- **Eddie Bravo**: "In the 10th Planet system, the Granby Roll is a cornerstone of our defensive inversion game, perfect for escaping traditional control positions. It’s all about rolling into space and using that inversion to set up unorthodox attacks or recoveries, fitting seamlessly with our focus on dynamic movement."

## Common Errors
- **Incorrect Shoulder Selection**: Rolling over wrong shoulder towards opponent (Why It Fails: Exposes back further or fails escape; Correction: Roll towards open space over opposite shoulder; Recognition: Ending in worse position or opponent securing back).
- **Untucked Chin**: Failing to protect neck during inversion (Why It Fails: Risks neck strain or injury; Correction: Always tuck chin to chest; Recognition: Neck discomfort or vulnerability during roll).
- **Insufficient Leg Drive**: Weak kick or push for momentum (Why It Fails: Roll stalls, leaving you inverted and exposed; Correction: Drive hard with legs for rotation; Recognition: Incomplete roll or stuck mid-inversion).
- **Poor Spatial Awareness**: Rolling into opponent’s control or no space (Why It Fails: Leads to immediate counter or pin; Correction: Identify open space before initiating; Recognition: Opponent easily regains control post-roll).
- **Loose Body Position**: Limbs extended during inversion (Why It Fails: Increases submission risk and injury; Correction: Keep body compact with arms protecting; Recognition: Opponent grabs limbs or joints strain mid-roll).
