## State Machine Content Elements

### Visual Execution Sequence
Detailed step-by-step description for clear movement sequence visualization:

From closed guard bottom, you establish a cross-collar grip with one hand while your other hand controls their same-side sleeve. Your opponent typically attempts to posture up or establish their own grips. You then swing your leg on the collar grip side in a pendulum motion toward their head while simultaneously pulling them off balance with your grips, creating a sweeping motion that brings them over your body. The momentum carries them to the side as you follow through by rolling over them, resulting in mount position with superior control.

**Template**: "From closed guard with cross-collar and sleeve grips, you pendulum your leg toward their head while pulling them off balance. Your opponent falls to the side as you follow through, resulting in mount position."

### Execution Steps (Numbered Sequence)
1. **Setup Requirements**: Establish cross-collar grip and same-side sleeve control from closed guard
2. **Initial Movement**: Open guard and begin pendulum swing with leg on collar-grip side
3. **Opponent Response**: Opponent typically tries to base out or resist the sweep
4. **Adaptation**: Adjust grip tension and leg swing timing based on their reaction
5. **Completion**: Complete pendulum motion while pulling with grips to sweep them over
6. **Consolidation**: Follow through by rolling over opponent to secure mount position

### Key Technical Details
Critical elements that determine success:
- **Grip Requirements**: Deep cross-collar grip, tight sleeve control on same side
- **Base/Foundation**: Strong pendulum leg swing creates momentum
- **Timing Windows**: Execute when opponent's weight is forward or they're adjusting grips
- **Leverage Points**: Collar grip provides directional control, leg swing provides power
- **Common Adjustments**: Vary swing angle and grip pulling direction based on resistance

### Success Modifiers
Factors that increase/decrease probability:
- **Setup Quality**: Deep grips and proper guard closure (+/-15%)
- **Timing Precision**: Executing during opponent's forward movement (+/-20%)
- **Opponent Fatigue**: Reduced defensive base and reactions (+/-5%)
- **Knowledge Test Performance**: Understanding sweep mechanics (+/-10%)
- **Position Control**: Quality of closed guard maintenance (+/-10%)

## Counter-Attack Analysis

### Common Counters
Opponent responses with success rates:
- **Base Out**: Posting hand on swept side to prevent rollover → [[Closed Guard Top]] (Success Rate: 60%, Conditions: early recognition)
- **Counter Sweep**: Using momentum to reverse the sweep → [[Top Position]] (Success Rate: 35%, Conditions: strong base)
- **Stack Defense**: Driving forward to prevent leg swing → [[Guard Pass]] (Success Rate: 40%, Conditions: timing dependent)
- **Grip Break**: Breaking collar or sleeve grip to neutralize → [[Open Guard]] (Success Rate: 45%, Conditions: superior grip fighting)

Format: `[[Counter Technique]] → [[Result State]] (Success Rate: X%, Conditions: [when applicable])`

### Decision Logic
```
If [grip setup quality] < 50%:
- Execute [[Grip Break]] (Probability: 45%)

Else if [sweep timing] is telegraphed:
- Execute [[Base Out]] (Probability: 60%)

Else if [opponent has superior position]:
- Execute [[Stack Defense]] (Probability: 40%)

Else [optimal sweep execution]:
- Accept transition (Probability: Success Rate - Modifiers)
```

## Educational Content

### Expert Insights
Commentary as if from recognized authorities:
- **John Danaher**: "The flower sweep succeeds through precise coordination of grip control and pendulum motion. The cross-collar grip provides directional steering while the leg swing generates the mechanical force. Most practitioners fail by rushing the timing rather than waiting for the opponent's weight to be properly positioned forward."
- **Gordon Ryan**: "In competition, I use the flower sweep as part of a sweep series, particularly when opponents are defensive in my guard. The threat of the sweep often opens up other attacks like triangles and armbars. The key is making the pendulum motion explosive while maintaining grip control throughout."
- **Eddie Bravo**: "The flower sweep integrates well with rubber guard concepts, especially when transitioning from mission control positions. It can be modified with different grip variations and combined with submission attempts for a complete attack system from guard."

Each insight should focus on one key technical or strategic element.

### Common Errors
For knowledge test generation:
- **Error**: Attempting sweep without proper grip establishment
- **Why It Fails**: Lack of control allows opponent to easily defend and counter
- **Correction**: Always secure deep cross-collar and sleeve grips before initiating
- **Recognition**: Notice if grips feel loose or opponent easily breaks them

- **Error**: Swinging leg too high toward opponent's face
- **Why It Fails**: Reduces leverage and makes sweep less effective
- **Correction**: Aim leg swing at hip/thigh level for optimal mechanics
- **Recognition**: Sweep feels weak or opponent doesn't move significantly

- **Error**: Not following through after initial sweep motion
- **Why It Fails**: Opponent can recover and counter-attack
- **Correction**: Continue rolling motion to secure mount position
- **Recognition**: Getting swept back or ending in scramble position

### Timing Considerations
When to attempt this transition:
- **Optimal Conditions**: When opponent leans forward or adjusts their grips
- **Avoid When**: Opponent has strong defensive posture with good base
- **Setup Sequences**: After failed submission attempts that bring opponent forward
- **Follow-up Windows**: Must complete within 2-3 seconds to prevent counter

### Prerequisites
Requirements before attempting:
- **Technical Skills**: Basic closed guard control and grip fighting
- **Physical Preparation**: Hip flexibility and core strength for pendulum motion
- **Positional Understanding**: Closed guard mechanics and sweep principles
- **Experience Level**: Beginner-friendly technique, good introduction to sweeps

## Technical Assessment Elements
