## State Description
The standing position is the starting point of all BJJ matches and represents a neutral state where neither opponent has a positional advantage. This position combines elements of wrestling, judo, and BJJ-specific strategies for grip fighting, posture, and entries into ground exchanges.

## Key Principles
- Maintain strong, balanced posture with knees slightly bent
- Control distance through grip management and footwork
- Create angles to set up takedown entries and avoid opponent's attacks
- Protect your legs from single/double leg takedown attempts
- Develop tactical awareness for transitioning between standing and ground exchanges

## Prerequisites
- Proper stance and balance
- Basic understanding of grip fighting
- Defensive awareness for takedown prevention

## State Invariants
- Both opponents are standing on their feet
- No established dominant grips or clinch positions
- Neutral scoring position

## Defensive Responses (When Opponent Has This State)

## Expert Insights
- **Danaher System**: Focus on controlling inside position for takedown entries, using the "Inside Control Theory" to set up single legs and penetration steps. Emphasizes proper posture that prevents opponent's attacks while enabling your own.
- **Gordon Ryan**: Prioritizes collar ties and head position to set up takedowns. Often uses front headlock position as a means to transition to the ground with upper body control.
- **Eddie Bravo**: Often skips the traditional standing phase with specialized guard pulls directly to rubber guard or specific 10th Planet bottom positions. When standing, focuses on wrestling-based entries without the gi.

## Common Errors
- Standing too upright → Vulnerability to leg attacks
- Poor weight distribution → Easily off-balanced
- Reaching for grips → Exposing arms to counters and throws
- Passive stance → Allowing opponent to dictate the engagement
