## State Machine Content Elements

### Visual Execution Sequence
Detailed step-by-step description for clear movement sequence visualization:

From closed guard bottom, you establish a collar grip with one hand while posting your other hand on the mat beside your hip. Your opponent typically maintains their posture or attempts to establish their own grips. You then perform a sit-up motion, bringing your posted hand to their opposite shoulder while simultaneously bumping your hips up and to the side. The combination of the sit-up, hip bump, and shoulder push creates an off-balancing force that sweeps them over to the side as you follow through, ending up in mount position with control established.

**Template**: "From closed guard with collar grip and hand posted, you sit up while bumping your hips and pushing their shoulder. Your opponent falls to the side as you follow through to mount position."

### Execution Steps (Numbered Sequence)
1. **Setup Requirements**: Establish collar grip and post hand on mat beside your hip
2. **Initial Movement**: Begin sit-up motion while maintaining closed guard
3. **Opponent Response**: Opponent typically tries to maintain posture or grip fight
4. **Adaptation**: Adjust timing and direction based on their balance and reaction
5. **Completion**: Complete hip bump while pushing shoulder to sweep them over
6. **Consolidation**: Follow through by transitioning to mount position

### Key Technical Details
Critical elements that determine success:
- **Grip Requirements**: Strong collar grip with one hand for control
- **Base/Foundation**: Hand posted on mat provides leverage for sit-up
- **Timing Windows**: Execute when opponent's weight is centered or forward
- **Leverage Points**: Hip bump combined with shoulder push creates off-balance
- **Common Adjustments**: Vary bump direction and timing based on opponent's reaction

### Success Modifiers
Factors that increase/decrease probability:
- **Setup Quality**: Strong grips and proper hand positioning (+/-10%)
- **Timing Precision**: Executing during optimal weight distribution (+/-15%)
- **Opponent Fatigue**: Reduced defensive reactions and balance (+/-5%)
- **Knowledge Test Performance**: Understanding sweep mechanics (+/-10%)
- **Position Control**: Quality of closed guard maintenance (+/-10%)

## Counter-Attack Analysis

### Common Counters
Opponent responses with success rates:
- **Base Out**: Posting hand on swept side to prevent rollover → [[Closed Guard Top]] (Success Rate: 55%, Conditions: quick reaction)
- **Weight Forward**: Leaning into the sweep to maintain balance → [[Guard Pass]] (Success Rate: 40%, Conditions: timing dependent)
- **Counter Sweep**: Using momentum to reverse the direction → [[Top Position]] (Success Rate: 30%, Conditions: superior timing)
- **Posture Up**: Creating distance to neutralize sweep mechanics → [[Open Guard]] (Success Rate: 45%, Conditions: strong posture)

Format: `[[Counter Technique]] → [[Result State]] (Success Rate: X%, Conditions: [when applicable])`

### Decision Logic
```
If [sweep timing] is telegraphed early:
- Execute [[Base Out]] (Probability: 55%)

Else if [opponent maintains] strong posture:
- Execute [[Posture Up]] (Probability: 45%)

Else if [sweep momentum] can be redirected:
- Execute [[Counter Sweep]] (Probability: 30%)

Else [optimal sweep execution]:
- Accept transition (Probability: Success Rate - Modifiers)
```

## Educational Content

### Expert Insights
Commentary as if from recognized authorities:
- **John Danaher**: "The hip bump sweep succeeds through proper coordination of upper and lower body movements. The key is understanding that the sit-up motion must be combined with the hip bump - neither action alone will create sufficient off-balancing force. The timing must be precise to catch the opponent when their weight distribution is vulnerable."
- **Gordon Ryan**: "In competition, I use the hip bump sweep as a fundamental technique to establish dominant position quickly. It's particularly effective against opponents who maintain a more upright posture in guard. The transition to mount is immediate, which allows for quick point scoring and submission opportunities."
- **Eddie Bravo**: "The hip bump sweep integrates perfectly with submission attempts from guard, particularly when opponents defend other attacks. It can be set up from various guard positions and combines well with rubber guard concepts when modified appropriately. The simplicity makes it highly reliable under pressure."

Each insight should focus on one key technical or strategic element.

### Common Errors
For knowledge test generation:
- **Error**: Attempting sweep without proper collar grip establishment
- **Why It Fails**: Lack of control allows opponent to easily defend and counter
- **Correction**: Always secure collar grip before initiating sweep motion
- **Recognition**: Opponent easily maintains balance during sweep attempt

- **Error**: Posting hand too far from body or in wrong position
- **Why It Fails**: Reduces leverage and power of the sit-up motion
- **Correction**: Post hand close to hip on same side for optimal leverage
- **Recognition**: Feeling weak or unstable during sit-up phase

- **Error**: Not following through completely to mount position
- **Why It Fails**: Opponent can recover guard or scramble to better position
- **Correction**: Continue motion until fully in mount with control established
- **Recognition**: Ending in scramble or opponent recovering position

### Timing Considerations
When to attempt this transition:
- **Optimal Conditions**: When opponent has upright posture with weight centered
- **Avoid When**: Opponent is low and heavy with strong base
- **Setup Sequences**: After failed submission attempts that bring opponent upright
- **Follow-up Windows**: Must complete transition within 2-3 seconds

### Prerequisites
Requirements before attempting:
- **Technical Skills**: Basic closed guard control and grip fighting
- **Physical Preparation**: Core strength for sit-up motion and hip mobility
- **Positional Understanding**: Closed guard mechanics and sweep principles
- **Experience Level**: Beginner-friendly technique, excellent first sweep to learn
