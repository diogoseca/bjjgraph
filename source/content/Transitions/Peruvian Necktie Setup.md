# Peruvian Necktie Setup
#bjj #transition #submission_setup #front_headlock #advanced

## Visual Execution Sequence

From front headlock with opponent turtled, you thread your arm around their neck from an unconventional angle, securing their near arm. Rolling over your opposite shoulder, you trap their arm and neck together while establishing a unique choking configuration. The Peruvian necktie creates pressure through an inverted position where your arm and their trapped arm compress their neck. The setup requires flexibility and precise timing.

**One-Sentence Summary**: "From front headlock, thread arm around neck and trap near arm, roll over opposite shoulder to establish inverted choking position known as Peruvian necktie."

## Execution Steps

1. **Setup Requirements**: Front headlock established, opponent turtled
2. **Arm Threading**: Thread arm around neck from unconventional angle
3. **Near Arm Control**: Trap opponent's near arm against their neck
4. **Rolling Motion**: Roll over your opposite shoulder pulling opponent
5. **Position Establishment**: Land in inverted position with choke locked
6. **Consolidation**: Apply pressure by extending and arching back

## Key Technical Details

- **Grip Requirements**: Specific arm threading angle, secure near arm trap
- **Base/Foundation**: Flexibility required for inverted finishing position
- **Timing Windows**: Best when opponent turtles tightly
- **Leverage Points**: Opponent's arm combined with your arm creates neck compression
- **Common Adjustments**: Angle of arm threading critical, rolling direction specific

## Common Counters

- **[[Protect Near Arm]]** → [[Front Headlock Maintained]] (Success Rate: 45%, Conditions: keep near arm defended)
- **[[Base Wide]]** → [[Turtle Position]] (Success Rate: 40%, Conditions: prevent rolling motion)
- **[[Turn Away]]** → [[Back Control Bottom]] (Success Rate: 30%, Conditions: follow roll direction)

## Expert Insights

### John Danaher
"The Peruvian necktie is named for its origin in South American grappling. It's a sophisticated technique requiring excellent body awareness and flexibility. The setup must be precise - small errors result in complete failure."

### Gordon Ryan
"This is a specialty technique I use sparingly. When the setup is there, it's very effective because most people haven't seen it enough to defend properly. But the setup window is small and requires specific circumstances."

### Eddie Bravo
"Peruvian necktie is one of those techniques that looks impossible until you learn it, then it becomes another tool. It's definitely advanced and requires commitment to the movement. Not for beginners, but awesome for those who master it."

## Common Errors

### Error 1: Incorrect threading angle
- **Why It Fails**: Cannot establish proper choking configuration
- **Correction**: Thread from specific angle to trap arm effectively
- **Recognition**: Arm position doesn't create pressure after roll

### Error 2: Hesitating during roll
- **Why It Fails**: Incomplete commitment allows opponent to defend
- **Correction**: Commit fully to rolling motion once initiated
- **Recognition**: Getting stuck mid-roll, losing control

### Error 3: Poor near arm control
- **Why It Fails**: Arm escapes during setup, choke cannot form
- **Correction**: Secure near arm trap before rolling
- **Recognition**: Opponent's arm slips free during transition

## Timing Considerations

- **Optimal Conditions**: Opponent turtled defensively, near arm accessible
- **Avoid When**: Opponent has strong mobility or awareness
- **Setup Sequences**: After other front headlock attacks defended
- **Follow-up Windows**: Must complete quickly or lose opportunity

## Prerequisites

- **Technical Skills**: Advanced front headlock control, rolling mechanics, flexibility
- **Physical Preparation**: Hip and spine flexibility for inverted position
- **Positional Understanding**: Advanced turtle top positioning
- **Experience Level**: Advanced - requires significant technical skill and flexibility

## Knowledge Assessment

1. **Mechanical Understanding**: "What creates the pressure in Peruvian necktie?"
   - A) Your arm squeezing alone
   - B) Opponent's trapped arm and your arm together compressing neck
   - C) Body weight
   - D) Leg pressure
   - **Answer**: B

2. **Timing Recognition**: "When should this setup be attempted?"
   - A) Anytime in front headlock
   - B) When opponent is turtled with near arm accessible
   - C) When you're in side control
   - D) From guard
   - **Answer**: B

3. **Error Prevention**: "What is the most common setup failure?"
   - A) Too fast
   - B) Incorrect arm threading angle preventing proper choke formation
   - C) Too slow
   - D) Wrong position
   - **Answer**: B

4. **Setup Requirements**: "What physical attribute is especially important?"
   - A) Strength only
   - B) Speed only
   - C) Flexibility for inverted finishing position
   - D) Weight
   - **Answer**: C

5. **Adaptation**: "What if setup doesn't complete cleanly?"
   - A) Force it harder
   - B) Transition to related technique like Darce or maintain front headlock
   - C) Give up entirely
   - D) Start over from standing
   - **Answer**: B

## Variants and Adaptations

- **Gi Specific**: Gi material can assist grip and control
- **No-Gi Specific**: Requires more precise body positioning
- **Self-Defense**: Not practical for self-defense due to complexity
- **Competition**: Specialty technique for advanced competitors
- **Size Differential**: Works regardless of size with proper technique

## Training Progressions

1. **Solo Practice**: Rolling movement and positioning without partner
2. **Cooperative Drilling**: Partner allows setup for movement learning
3. **Resistant Practice**: Partner provides progressive defense
4. **Sparring Integration**: Attempting in live rolling when opportunity appears
5. **Troubleshooting**: Refining arm threading and rolling mechanics
