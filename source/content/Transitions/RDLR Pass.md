# RDLR Pass
#bjj #transition #guard_pass #rdlr #advanced

## Visual Execution Sequence

From reverse De La Riva guard top position, the opponent has their hook behind your knee with foot pressing on your hip. You establish grips to control their legs and upper body. Your first objective is to clear the RDLR hook by creating the right angle and pressure. You step your hooked leg back and around, potentially going to knee down position, while controlling their far leg to prevent re-guard. Your upper body pressure drives forward as you extract from the hook, transitioning to knee slice, half guard pass, or direct side control based on their defensive positioning.

**One-Sentence Summary**: "From RDLR top with proper grips, you clear the hook by stepping back and around while controlling their legs, passing to dominant position."

## Execution Steps

1. **Setup Requirements**: Establish RDLR top position with appropriate grips (pants, belt, or collar)
2. **Initial Movement**: Create angle and begin to step hooked leg back and around
3. **Opponent Response**: Opponent tries to maintain hook or transition to different guard
4. **Adaptation**: Adjust angle based on hook retention, control far leg to prevent re-guard
5. **Completion**: Clear hook completely, drive forward to passing position
6. **Consolidation**: Establish side control, knee slice, or continue to back depending on angle

## Key Technical Details

- **Grip Requirements**: Control on pants/belt/gi, far leg control, posture management
- **Base/Foundation**: Create wide base, step hooked leg strategically to clear hook
- **Timing Windows**: Pass when opponent's hook is shallow or when you have strong leg control
- **Leverage Points**: Far leg control prevents re-guard, upper body pressure drives pass
- **Common Adjustments**: Vary stepping angle, sometimes go to knee, adjust based on hook depth

## Common Counters

- **[[Hook Retention]]** ’ [[RDLR Maintained]] (Success Rate: 45%, Conditions: deep hook)
- **[[Transition to DLR]]** ’ [[DLR Guard]] (Success Rate: 40%, Conditions: opponent switches guards)
- **[[Butterfly Recovery]]** ’ [[Butterfly Guard]] (Success Rate: 35%, Conditions: loses leg control)

## Expert Insights

### John Danaher
"Reverse De La Riva passing requires understanding the hook mechanics. The opponent's hook is their primary control - once you understand how to clear it systematically, the pass becomes much simpler. Leg control and angle creation are key. Don't fight directly against the hook's strength."

### Gordon Ryan
"RDLR is common at high levels. My passing focuses on controlling the far leg while clearing the hook with proper footwork. The back step is crucial - it removes the hook's leverage. From there, it's about preventing re-guard and finishing the pass efficiently."

### Eddie Bravo
"We see lots of leg entanglement guards in modern BJJ. RDLR is one. The principle for passing is similar across all of them - control what you can, systematically clear what's controlling you, drive forward. Angles matter more than strength."

## Common Errors

### Error 1: Fighting the Hook Directly
- **Why It Fails**: Hook has mechanical advantage when you pull straight back
- **Correction**: Step at an angle, use back step to clear hook leverage
- **Recognition**: Feeling stuck with hook maintaining control despite effort

### Error 2: No Far Leg Control
- **Why It Fails**: Opponent easily transitions to other guards or recovers RDLR
- **Correction**: Establish far leg control before or during hook clearing
- **Recognition**: Opponent constantly switching guards or re-establishing RDLR

### Error 3: Poor Upper Body Posture
- **Why It Fails**: Opponent can off-balance you or create sweeping opportunities
- **Correction**: Maintain upright posture while clearing hook
- **Recognition**: Feeling off-balanced or swept during passing attempt
