## State Machine Content Elements

### Visual Execution Sequence
Detailed step-by-step description for clear movement sequence visualization:

From standing position with collar and sleeve control, you use your grips to drive your opponent sideways and slightly backward, forcing them to post their weight heavily on one leg. As they shift their weight onto their back leg to maintain balance, you step in close to them while positioning yourself slightly to their side. Your reaping leg moves behind their supporting leg, making contact with the outside edge or heel of your foot against the back of their calf or ankle. The key is to create a pulling motion with your upper body grips that drives them backward and down while simultaneously reaping their supporting leg out from under them. The combination of the backward-diagonal pull and leg reap causes them to fall onto their back with you maintaining control throughout. You follow through by driving forward and landing in a dominant top position such as side control or transitioning to knee on belly.

**Template**: "From standing with collar-sleeve grips, drive opponent sideways-backward onto one leg. Step close positioning yourself to side, reap supporting leg from behind with outside of foot. Pull backward-down with grips while reaping leg removes their base. Follow through driving forward to dominant top position."

### Execution Steps (Numbered Sequence)
1. **Setup Requirements**: Establish strong collar and sleeve grips from standing position
2. **Initial Movement**: Pull opponent onto one leg by driving them sideways and back
3. **Opponent Response**: Opponent posts weight on back leg to maintain balance
4. **Adaptation**: Adjust reaping angle based on opponent's weight distribution
5. **Completion**: Reap supporting leg from behind with outside of your foot
6. **Consolidation**: Drive through with grips to complete takedown to top position

### Key Technical Details
Critical elements that determine success:
- **Grip Requirements**: Strong collar and sleeve control for directional pulling
- **Base/Foundation**: Proper positioning close to opponent with stable stance
- **Timing Windows**: Execute reap when opponent's weight is committed to one leg
- **Leverage Points**: Backward pull combined with leg reap creates off-balance
- **Common Adjustments**: Vary reaping angle and grip direction based on opponent height

### Success Modifiers
Factors that increase/decrease probability:
- **Setup Quality**: Effective weight shifting onto one leg (+/-15%)
- **Timing Precision**: Executing reap when weight is fully committed (+/-20%)
- **Opponent Fatigue**: Reduced balance and defensive reactions (+/-5%)
- **Knowledge Test Performance**: Understanding kuzushi mechanics (+/-10%)
- **Position Control**: Quality of grip control and driving motion (+/-15%)

## Counter-Attack Analysis

### Common Counters
Opponent responses with success rates:
- **Weight Shift**: Quickly shifting weight to other leg → [[Standing Position]] (Success Rate: 40%, Conditions: early recognition)
- **Step Back**: Stepping back with reaped leg → [[Clinch Position]] (Success Rate: 35%, Conditions: good footwork)
- **Counter Throw**: Using driving momentum for own takedown → [[Top Position]] (Success Rate: 25%, Conditions: superior timing)
- **Sprawl Defense**: Dropping hips and sprawling → [[Front Headlock]] (Success Rate: 20%, Conditions: wrestling background)

Format: `[[Counter Technique]] → [[Result State]] (Success Rate: X%, Conditions: [when applicable])`

### Decision Logic
```
If [weight shift] is incomplete:
- Execute [[Weight Shift]] (Probability: 40%)

Else if [footwork] allows step back:
- Execute [[Step Back]] (Probability: 35%)

Else if [momentum can be redirected]:
- Execute [[Counter Throw]] (Probability: 25%)

Else if [wrestling defense] is available:
- Execute [[Sprawl Defense]] (Probability: 20%)

Else [optimal throw execution]:
- Accept transition (Probability: Success Rate - Modifiers)
```

## Educational Content

### Expert Insights
Commentary as if from recognized authorities:
- **John Danaher**: "Kosoto gari is a fundamental reaping technique that teaches the principle of isolating your opponent's weight onto one leg before attacking. The setup phase is more important than the reap itself - if you've properly shifted their weight, the reap becomes almost inevitable. The technique demonstrates how kuzushi (balance breaking) is the foundation of all effective takedowns. Your grips must create a diagonal pulling direction that makes standing on one leg their only option."
- **Gordon Ryan**: "In competition, kosoto gari is highly effective because it works against defensive stances. When opponents are low and defensive, many throws don't work well, but kosoto gari thrives in this situation. I use it constantly to score takedown points because the setup looks like normal grip fighting. The key is disguising the attack until the last moment when you commit to the reap. It's deceptive and effective."
- **Eddie Bravo**: "Kosoto gari integrates perfectly with modern no-gi grappling because the mechanics work with any grip configuration. In the 10th Planet system, we use it to create entries for our guard game when partially defended. The low-risk nature and high success rate make it perfect for maintaining pressure in standing positions without burning energy. It's efficiency personified."

Each insight should focus on one key technical or strategic element.

### Common Errors
For knowledge test generation:
- **Error**: Attempting reap without proper weight shift setup
- **Why It Fails**: Opponent's weight is distributed, making them stable
- **Correction**: Use grips to force weight onto back leg before reaping
- **Recognition**: Opponent easily maintains balance or steps away

- **Error**: Reaping leg not positioned correctly behind supporting leg
- **Why It Fails**: Cannot effectively remove base point
- **Correction**: Step close and place reaping foot behind their calf/ankle
- **Recognition**: Reap has no effect or opponent steps over

- **Error**: Not coordinating upper body pull with leg reap
- **Why It Fails**: Lacks synchronized force to complete takedown
- **Correction**: Pull backward-diagonal with grips as you reap
- **Recognition**: Opponent recovers balance despite leg contact

### Timing Considerations
When to attempt this transition:
- **Optimal Conditions**: When opponent is defensive with weight on back leg
- **Avoid When**: Opponent is mobile with constantly shifting weight
- **Setup Sequences**: After creating lateral-backward pressure with grips
- **Follow-up Windows**: Must complete driving motion within 2-3 seconds

### Prerequisites
Requirements before attempting:
- **Technical Skills**: Basic standing grip fighting and kuzushi understanding
- **Physical Preparation**: Hip mobility and leg reach for reaping motion
- **Positional Understanding**: Standing position mechanics and weight distribution
- **Experience Level**: Intermediate technique requiring proper setup

## Technical Assessment Elements

### Knowledge Assessment Questions
5 technical questions with multiple choice answers:
- **Mechanical Understanding**: "What creates the effectiveness in kosoto gari?"
- **Timing Recognition**: "When should you execute the reap?"
- **Error Prevention**: "What is the most common setup mistake?"
- **Setup Requirements**: "Which grip action shifts weight onto back leg?"
- **Adaptation**: "How do you adjust when opponent shifts weight forward?"

### Variants and Adaptations
Different versions for various scenarios:

## Historical Context
Kosoto gari is one of the original 40 throws of Kodokan Judo, classified as a foot/leg technique (ashi waza). It emphasizes kuzushi and proper weight distribution over strength, making it effective for practitioners of all sizes. The technique has been seamlessly integrated into Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu's standing game as a reliable takedown option.

## Safety Considerations
- **Landing Control**: Maintain grip connection to control opponent's fall
- **Mat Awareness**: Ensure adequate space for safe completion
- **Training Partners**: Practice with appropriate resistance levels
- **Breakfall Skills**: Both partners should understand proper falling techniques
