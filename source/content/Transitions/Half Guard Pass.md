# Half Guard Pass
#bjj #transition #guard_pass #half_guard #fundamental

## Visual Execution Sequence

From half guard top position, you establish control with crossface and underhook pressure. Your opponent maintains the half guard lockdown on one leg. You create forward pressure while working to free your trapped leg, using hip pressure and angle changes. The crossface controls their head while your underhook prevents them from coming to their side. You gradually work your knee free, sliding it across their legs while maintaining top pressure, resulting in side control position with full cross-face control.

**One-Sentence Summary**: "From half guard top with crossface and underhook, you apply forward pressure while freeing your trapped leg to achieve side control."

## Execution Steps

1. **Setup Requirements**: Establish half guard top position with crossface and underhook control
2. **Initial Movement**: Apply forward pressure with chest, drive opponent flat
3. **Opponent Response**: Opponent tries to maintain half guard, potentially seeking underhook
4. **Adaptation**: Adjust pressure angle, work knee position to create extraction angle
5. **Completion**: Slide trapped knee across and free the leg, establish side control
6. **Consolidation**: Secure side control with crossface, settle weight, establish grips

## Key Technical Details

- **Grip Requirements**: Crossface with near arm, underhook with far arm, or variations
- **Base/Foundation**: Drive weight forward and down, use chest pressure
- **Timing Windows**: Pass when opponent is flat and defensive, not when they have strong frames
- **Leverage Points**: Crossface controls head, underhook prevents side recovery
- **Common Adjustments**: Vary pressure angle, adjust knee position for extraction

## Common Counters

Opponent defensive responses with success rates and conditions:

- **[[Underhook Recovery]]** ’ [[Half Guard Bottom Improved]] (Success Rate: 50%, Conditions: strong underhook fight)
- **[[Lockdown]]** ’ [[Half Guard Maintained]] (Success Rate: 40%, Conditions: locks leg early)
- **[[Knee Shield Frame]]** ’ [[Half Guard Distance]] (Success Rate: 45%, Conditions: creates frames)

### Decision Logic for AI Opponent

```
If [crossface not established]:
- Execute [[Underhook Recovery]] (Probability: 50%)

Else if [leg trapped deeply]:
- Execute [[Lockdown]] (Probability: 40%)

Else [pass progressing]:
- Accept transition (Probability: Base Success Rate - Applied Modifiers)
```

## Expert Insights

### John Danaher
"The half guard pass is fundamental to top game. The key is controlling the upper body first - crossface and underhook - then working to free the leg. Many make the mistake of fighting only the leg. Control the head and shoulder, the leg extraction becomes much easier."

### Gordon Ryan
"I pass half guard constantly in competition. The crossface is non-negotiable. Once I have that, the pass is just a matter of time. Pressure forward, stay heavy, work the leg free methodically. Don't rush - control beats speed."

### Eddie Bravo
"Half guard is our base in 10th Planet, so we see lots of half guard passing. The best passes combine pressure with technique. You can't just muscle through lockdown - you need proper angles and control. Crossface first, always."

## Common Errors

### Error 1: No Crossface Control
- **Why It Fails**: Opponent can easily recover guard or take your back
- **Correction**: Always establish strong crossface before attempting pass
- **Recognition**: Opponent easily turns into you or recovers full guard

### Error 2: Standing Too Upright
- **Why It Fails**: Reduces pressure and allows opponent to create frames
- **Correction**: Stay low, drive chest pressure forward
- **Recognition**: Opponent creates knee shield or distance easily

### Error 3: Fighting Only The Leg
- **Why It Fails**: Opponent uses upper body freedom to defend or attack
- **Correction**: Control upper body first, leg extraction second
- **Recognition**: Struggling with leg while opponent attacks your head/arms

## Prerequisites

- **Technical Skills**: Basic top pressure, understanding of side control position
- **Physical Preparation**: Moderate upper body strength for crossface, hip mobility
- **Positional Understanding**: Half guard mechanics, side control consolidation
- **Experience Level**: Beginner-friendly technique, fundamental passing concept
