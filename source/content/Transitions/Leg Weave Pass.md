# Leg Weave Pass
#bjj #transition #guard_pass #pressure

## Visual Execution Sequence

From open guard top position facing opponent's guard, you control one of their legs by threading your arm underneath their knee and gripping their opposite hip or belt. Your head drives forward toward their far shoulder while your threading arm creates a weaving motion that clears their bottom leg off your hip. As you weave through, your chest applies forward pressure while you walk your hips around the entangled leg toward side control. The opponent's leg is pinned between your body and theirs as you complete the pass, establishing side control with the passed leg trapped and controlled.

**One-Sentence Summary**: "Threading arm under opponent's knee while driving chest pressure forward, you weave your body around the entangled leg to establish side control."

## Execution Steps

1. **Setup Requirements**: Establish open guard top position; secure grip on opponent's leg (often knee area); control their hip or belt on opposite side
2. **Initial Movement**: Thread one arm underneath their near knee; establish grip on far hip or belt
3. **Opponent Response**: Opponent typically attempts to create frames, re-guard with bottom leg, or create space to prevent pressure
4. **Adaptation**: Drive head toward their far shoulder while applying chest pressure; walk hips around the weave
5. **Completion**: Clear their bottom leg completely; establish chest-to-chest pressure; secure side control position
6. **Consolidation**: Trap passed leg between your legs; establish crossface or underhook control; settle weight

## Key Technical Details

- **Grip Requirements**: Threading arm grips far hip or belt; other hand may control near leg, collar, or establish underhook
- **Base/Foundation**: Wide base with legs for stability; ability to walk hips laterally while maintaining pressure
- **Timing Windows**: Execute when opponent's bottom leg is off your hip; during their guard transition or adjustment
- **Leverage Points**: Chest pressure drives forward; threading arm weaves and controls; head pressure prevents frames
- **Common Adjustments**: If opponent re-guards, reset and weave again; vary pressure direction based on their frames

## Common Counters

Opponent defensive responses with success rates and conditions:

- **[[Re-Guard]]** → [[Guard Recovered]] (Success Rate: 45%, Conditions: opponent gets bottom leg back to hip before pass completes)
- **[[Frame and Shrimp]]** → [[Half Guard]] (Success Rate: 40%, Conditions: opponent creates frames and recovers half guard)
- **[[Underhook Battle]]** → [[Deep Half Entry]] (Success Rate: 30%, Conditions: opponent secures underhook on passing side)
- **[[Roll Under]]** → [[Sweep Attempt]] (Success Rate: 25%, Conditions: opponent inverts or rolls under during pass)

### Decision Logic for AI Opponent

```
If [leg weave initiated] AND [bottom leg free]:
- Execute [[Re-Guard]] (Probability: 45%)

Else if [pressure building] AND [frames available]:
- Execute [[Frame and Shrimp]] (Probability: 40%)

Else if [passing side accessible]:
- Execute [[Underhook Battle]] (Probability: 30%)

Else [pass too advanced]:
- Accept pass (Probability: Base Success Rate with Modifiers)
```

## Expert Insights

### John Danaher
"The leg weave pass is effective because it combines control with forward pressure in a way that's difficult to defend. By threading your arm through and controlling the far hip, you create a configuration where the opponent's own leg becomes a barrier to their defensive movement. The key is maintaining chest pressure throughout - if you stand upright or release pressure, they'll recover guard immediately. Think of it as pressure passing with a built-in control mechanism."

### Gordon Ryan
"I use leg weave variations constantly in both gi and no-gi. The beauty is that you're controlling them while passing - they can't create the space they need for guard retention because your threading arm and chest pressure eliminate it. The mistake people make is trying to force the pass too quickly. You need to consolidate the weave first, settle your pressure, then walk around methodically. Rushing creates scrambles where you might lose the pass."

### Eddie Bravo
"In no-gi especially, the leg weave is money because you don't have gi grips to rely on. That threading arm is your anchor point - it keeps you connected and prevents them from creating distance. I teach variations where you can switch between leg weave, knee cut, and headquarters depending on how they defend. It's not just one pass - it's a passing system. But the foundation is that weave control with consistent forward pressure."

## Common Errors

### Error 1: Insufficient Chest Pressure
- **Why It Fails**: Standing too upright or releasing pressure allows opponent to create frames and recover guard
- **Correction**: Maintain heavy chest pressure throughout pass; head drives toward far shoulder; chest stays connected
- **Recognition**: Opponent easily creates space; feeling light or disconnected during pass

### Error 2: Weaving Without Hip Walking
- **Why It Fails**: Threading arm alone doesn't complete pass; must walk hips around to reach side control
- **Correction**: Coordinate threading arm control with systematic hip walking toward opponent's head
- **Recognition**: Stuck in middle of pass with threading arm but not progressing to side control

### Error 3: Releasing Threading Arm Too Early
- **Why It Fails**: Letting go of threading grip before establishing side control allows opponent to recover guard
- **Correction**: Maintain threading arm grip until chest-to-chest pressure and position are secure
- **Recognition**: Opponent slips guard back in as you transition to side control

## Timing Considerations

- **Optimal Conditions**: When opponent's bottom leg is off your hip; during their guard transitions; when they're defending different threats
- **Avoid When**: Opponent has strong frames already established; their bottom leg is firmly on your hip; they have deep underhook
- **Setup Sequences**: After threatening different pass to move bottom leg; following failed sweep attempt; during their guard transition
- **Follow-up Windows**: Must establish secure side control within 2-3 seconds of completing pass to prevent guard recovery

## Prerequisites

- **Technical Skills**: Understanding of pressure passing concepts; hip walking ability; basic guard passing mechanics
- **Physical Preparation**: Core strength for pressure maintenance; hip mobility for walking motion; shoulder stability for threading arm
- **Positional Understanding**: Open guard passing principles; side control establishment; pressure application concepts
- **Experience Level**: Intermediate technique; requires understanding of pressure passing and guard passing timing

## Knowledge Assessment

1. **Mechanical Understanding**: "What creates the controlling pressure in the leg weave pass?"
   - A) Only the threading arm grip
   - B) The combination of threading arm control, chest pressure, and hip walking
   - C) Only your weight
   - D) Standing pressure alone
   - **Answer**: B

2. **Timing Recognition**: "When is the optimal moment to initiate the leg weave?"
   - A) When opponent has both feet on your hips
   - B) When opponent's bottom leg is off your hip or during their guard transition
   - C) When standing upright
   - D) When you're already in side control
   - **Answer**: B

3. **Error Prevention**: "What is the most common mistake during leg weave pass?"
   - A) Maintaining too much pressure
   - B) Walking hips too methodically
   - C) Releasing chest pressure or standing upright during pass
   - D) Threading arm too deep
   - **Answer**: C

4. **Setup Requirements**: "What must you do with opponent's bottom leg before beginning the weave?"
   - A) Leave it on your hip
   - B) Clear it off your hip and keep it cleared
   - C) Ignore it completely
   - D) Elevate it higher
   - **Answer**: B

5. **Adaptation**: "How should you adjust if opponent begins to recover guard during the weave?"
   - A) Give up immediately
   - B) Stand up completely
   - C) Increase chest pressure, reestablish threading control, continue hip walking
   - D) Switch to a different pass entirely without maintaining position
   - **Answer**: C

## Variants and Adaptations

- **Gi Specific**: Can use belt or gi pants grip with threading arm; collar grip with other hand for additional control
- **No-Gi Specific**: Threading arm typically grips hip or reaches to far side body; requires tighter connection due to less friction
- **Self-Defense**: Modified version with strikes in mind; prioritize control over speed
- **Competition**: Strategic pressure passing for control-heavy competition approach; scores guard pass points
- **Size Differential**: Smaller practitioners rely more on tight weave mechanics; larger practitioners can add more pressure

## Training Progressions

1. **Solo Practice**: Practice threading motion and hip walking pattern without partner; develop coordination
2. **Cooperative Drilling**: Partner allows pass completion to learn mechanics and feeling of proper weave
3. **Resistant Practice**: Partner provides progressive guard retention; you must time weave and maintain pressure
4. **Sparring Integration**: Recognize leg weave opportunities during rolling; execute under resistance
5. **Troubleshooting**: Identify why weave fails against specific defenses; adjust technique accordingly
