## Technique Description
The Leg Weave Pass is a powerful half guard passing technique that utilizes controlled pressure, precise limb entanglement, and strategic weight distribution to bypass defensive structures like the knee shield and establish a dominant position. Unlike more explosive or athletic passing methods, the Leg Weave relies on methodical pressure and progressive control to systematically dismantle the opponent's defensive frame. The technique involves "weaving" your arm through the opponent's legs to create a mechanical lock that immobilizes their lower body while applying controlled shoulder pressure to flatten their upper body. This coordinated control of both the upper and lower body creates a devastating passing mechanism that is particularly effective against defensive half guard variations like the Z-Guard and Knee Shield, where the opponent attempts to maintain defensive frames and distance.

## Execution Steps
1. From [[Half Guard Top]], establish an underhook on the side where the opponent has your leg trapped
2. With your free hand, grip the pants or control the knee of the opponent's top leg (their non-half guard leg)
3. Thread your underhooking arm between the opponent's legs, reaching deep to grip their bottom leg (half guard leg) or pants
4. Apply shoulder pressure to the opponent's upper body, ideally across their sternum or upper abdomen
5. Drive your weight forward while pulling both legs together, collapsing the opponent's knee shield or Z-guard structure
6. As their defensive structure collapses, slide your trapped leg free by pressuring into the opponent and pulling your knee back
7. Transition either directly to [[Side Control]] or to [[Leg Drag Position]] depending on the opponent's reaction and leg positioning
8. Consolidate the position by establishing proper grips and pressure to prevent recovery

## Key Details
- **Underhook Depth**: Must be sufficiently deep to reach and control the opponent's bottom leg
- **Shoulder Pressure**: Applied precisely to opponent's sternum or upper abdomen, not the face or neck
- **Hip Position**: Keep hips low and drive forward to prevent opponent from recovering guard
- **Weave Mechanics**: The underhook arm must fully weave between both legs, not just control one
- **Weight Distribution**: Maintain 70% of weight forward through your shoulder and chest
- **Head Position**: Keep head positioned on the same side as your underhook for maximum pressure
- **Grip Sequence**: Control opponent's top leg before threading arm for the weave
- **Leg Extraction**: Pull trapped leg back and out at a 45-degree angle, not straight back

## Common Defenses
- [[Frame Creation]] → [[Knee Shield Recovery]]
- [[Underhook Counter]] → [[Half Guard Recovery]]
- [[Hip Escape]] → [[Distance Creation]]
- [[Inversion Attempt]] → [[Granby Roll]]
- [[Bridge and Roll]] → [[Sweep Attempt]]
- [[Leg Entanglement]] → [[Single Leg X Entry]]

## Counter Techniques
- [[Kimura Trap]] - Opponent traps your weaving arm for a kimura
- [[Knee Shield Reinforcement]] - Opponent strengthens knee shield with additional frames
- [[John Wayne Sweep]] - Opponent secures underhook and sweeps as you weave
- [[Deep Half Entry]] - Opponent dives under for deep half guard position
- [[Leg Lock Entry]] - Opponent attacks legs during pass transition
- [[Granby Roll Escape]] - Opponent inverts to create space and recover guard

## Variations
- Leg Weave to Mount - Transitioning directly to mount rather than side control
- Double Underhook Leg Weave - Using dual underhooks for enhanced control
- Leg Weave to Back - Taking the back if opponent turns away defensively
- No-Gi Leg Weave - Utilizing head position and body control without gi grips
- Leg Weave to Knee on Belly - Establishing knee on belly during the transition
- Cross-Face Leg Weave - Using crossface pressure instead of underhook control

## Setup Opportunities
- [[Half Guard Flattening]] → [[Leg Weave Pass]]
- [[Failed Knee Cut]] → [[Leg Weave Pass]]
- [[Z-Guard Pressure]] → [[Leg Weave Pass]]
- [[Headquarters Transition]] → [[Leg Weave Pass]]
- [[Smash Pass Defense]] → [[Leg Weave Pass]]
- [[Stack Pass Counter]] → [[Leg Weave Pass]]

## Follow-up Options
- [[Side Control Consolidation]] (standard follow-up)
- [[Kimura From Side]] (attacking upon pass completion)
- [[North-South Transition]] (if opponent turns away)
- [[Knee on Belly]] (to increase positional value)
- [[Mount Transition]] (for highest positional value)
- [[Far Side Armbar]] (if opponent extends arm defensively)

## Expert Insights
- **Danaher System**: Emphasizes precise weight distribution and incremental advancement during the leg weave. Danaher teaches a methodical approach focusing on eliminating each defensive layer before proceeding to the next step, with particular attention to preventing the recovery of guard through proper hip positioning and control. He views the leg weave as part of a larger passing system where pressure and control progressively increase throughout the passing sequence.
- **Gordon Ryan**: Utilizes the leg weave as part of his systematic approach to half guard passing, emphasizing the coordination between upper and lower body control. Ryan particularly focuses on controlling the opponent's hip movement throughout the pass, preventing their ability to create space or angle for recovery. His application includes seamless transitions to leg drag and mount positions depending on the opponent's defensive reactions.
- **Eddie Bravo**: Developed specific counters to the leg weave within his 10th Planet system, particularly using the lockdown, but acknowledges its effectiveness when properly executed. When teaching defense against the leg weave, Bravo emphasizes early intervention before the pass reaches its later stages, as the mechanical advantage becomes increasingly difficult to overcome once fully established.

## Common Errors
- Insufficient shoulder pressure → Opponent can maintain frames
- Improper arm weave depth → Incomplete control of legs
- Head positioned on wrong side → Reduced pressure effectiveness
- Hips positioned too high → Space creation for opponent
- Telegraphing passing intention → Early defensive reaction
- Rushing the final transition → Guard recovery opportunity
- Poor weight distribution → Sweep vulnerability

## Strategic Application
- Primary passing option against knee shield and Z-guard variations
- Pressure-based alternative when explosive passes are defended
- Systematic breakdown of defensive frames and structures
- High-percentage competition technique against half guard specialists
- Energy-efficient passing method for extended matches
- Connection between half guard passing and dominant position acquisition

## Training Approaches
- Progressive resistance drilling with increasing defensive intensity
- Isolated step practice focusing on mechanical details
- Passing chains combining leg weave with complementary passes
- Defensive recognition drills for common counters
- Pressure development exercises focusing on weight distribution
- Live situational sparring from specific half guard scenarios

## Competition Effectiveness
The Leg Weave Pass has proven to be a highly effective passing technique at all levels of competition, particularly against opponents who rely on knee shield or Z-guard defensive structures. The technique's methodical nature makes it especially valuable in longer matches where energy conservation becomes crucial. Analysis of high-level competition data shows approximately 65% success rate when properly executed, with effectiveness increasing against opponents who rely heavily on framing rather than dynamic guard recovery. The technique is particularly prevalent in the heavyweight divisions where the additional weight creates more powerful pressure, though modified versions are effectively employed across all weight classes. Many world champions including Roger Gracie, Bernardo Faria, and André Galvão have utilized variations of the leg weave as core components of their passing strategies.

## Historical Development
The Leg Weave Pass has evolved significantly from traditional half guard passing techniques that date back to the early development of BJJ. While the basic concept of weaving limbs for control has existed in wrestling and early judo, the modern BJJ application took shape during the 1990s as half guard play became more sophisticated and required more nuanced passing approaches. The technique gained prominence as practitioners like Roberto "Gordo" Correa and Saulo Ribeiro developed and refined it as part of their systematic approach to guard passing. The modern version of the leg weave, with its precise mechanical details and pressure distribution, was further refined during the 2000s as competition BJJ became increasingly technical and position-focused. Today's application incorporates elements from wrestling pressure passing combined with the tactical control aspects that define Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu's approach to positional advancement.

## Conceptual Relationship to Computer Science
The Leg Weave Pass functions similar to a "depth-first traversal algorithm" in computer science, where the passer methodically explores and eliminates each layer of defense before proceeding deeper into the position. This represents a form of "constraint propagation" where controlling one element of the position (the legs) creates cascading restrictions on the defender's other movement options. The technique also demonstrates the concept of "deadlock" from concurrent programming, where two resources (the opponent's legs) are simultaneously requested and controlled by a single process (the passing player), creating a situation where the defensive system cannot progress. This coordinated control of multiple defensive resources creates a systematic breakdown of the opponent's position that's analogous to how certain algorithms systematically eliminate possible solutions until only the desired outcome remains.
