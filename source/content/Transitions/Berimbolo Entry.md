- **Speed Requirements**: High for timing-dependent execution

## State Machine Content Elements

### Visual Execution Sequence
Detailed step-by-step description for clear movement sequence visualization:

From De La Riva guard bottom, you establish control with your hook on their leg, a far-side collar grip, and control of their near ankle. Your opponent typically attempts to pass or maintain their balance while dealing with your guard. You initiate the berimbolo by inverting underneath them, rolling toward your hooking side while maintaining tight control of their ankle. As you rotate underneath, your De La Riva hook transitions to thread through between their legs while your other leg comes over their back. You complete the spiral rotation by coming up behind them, ending in back control with your chest against their back and your legs working to establish hooks. The technique requires precise timing and continuous rotation to prevent opponent adjustment.

**Template**: "From De La Riva guard with ankle control, invert underneath rolling toward hook side. Thread leg through while rotating, come up behind opponent's back to establish back control."

### Execution Steps (Numbered Sequence)
1. **Setup Requirements**: Establish De La Riva hook with far-side collar grip and near ankle control
2. **Initial Movement**: Invert underneath opponent by rolling toward your hooking side
3. **Opponent Response**: Opponent attempts to maintain balance or pressure down to prevent inversion
4. **Adaptation**: Thread hooking leg through while maintaining tight cuff control on ankle
5. **Completion**: Complete spiral rotation to come up behind opponent's back
6. **Consolidation**: Establish back control with hooks in and upper body control (seatbelt)

### Key Technical Details
Critical elements that determine success:
- **Grip Requirements**: Far-side collar grip and near ankle cuff control for rotation
- **Base/Foundation**: Inverted posture on shoulders with hips high during rotation
- **Timing Windows**: Execute when opponent is off-balance or committing to pass
- **Leverage Points**: De La Riva hook and ankle control create rotational axis
- **Common Adjustments**: Adjust rotation speed and direction based on opponent's pressure

### Success Modifiers
Factors that increase/decrease probability:
- **Setup Quality**: Tightness of De La Riva hook and ankle control (+/-15%)
- **Timing Precision**: Executing during opponent's weight shift (+/-20%)
- **Opponent Fatigue**: Reduced balance and reaction time (+/-10%)
- **Knowledge Test Performance**: Understanding rotational mechanics (+/-15%)
- **Position Control**: Quality of inversion and threading (+/-10%)

## Counter-Attack Analysis

### Common Counters
Opponent responses with success rates:
- **Sit to Combat Base**: Sitting to base to prevent rotation → [[De La Riva Guard Top]] (Success Rate: 55%, Conditions: early recognition)
- **Sprawl and Pressure**: Driving weight down during inversion → [[Top Position]] (Success Rate: 45%, Conditions: good base)
- **Ankle Lock Entry**: Attacking exposed leg during inversion → [[Leg Lock Position]] (Success Rate: 35%, Conditions: if leg is exposed)
- **Switch to Half Guard**: Trapping leg to prevent back take → [[Half Guard Top]] (Success Rate: 40%, Conditions: if rotation is slow)

Format: `[[Counter Technique]] → [[Result State]] (Success Rate: X%, Conditions: [when applicable])`

### Decision Logic
```
If [berimbolo entry] is recognized early:
- Execute [[Sit to Combat Base]] (Probability: 55%)

Else if [opponent is inverted]:
- Execute [[Sprawl and Pressure]] (Probability: 45%)

Else if [leg is exposed] during rotation:
- Execute [[Ankle Lock Entry]] (Probability: 35%)

Else [optimal entry execution]:
- Accept transition (Probability: Success Rate - Modifiers)
```

## Educational Content

### Expert Insights
Commentary as if from recognized authorities:
- **John Danaher**: "The berimbolo represents a paradigm shift in guard play, utilizing inversion and rotation to attack the back from what was traditionally considered a defensive position. The mechanical principle centers on using the opponent's standing posture against them - their upright base becomes a liability when you rotate underneath. The key is maintaining constant control of their lower body while your upper body creates the rotational momentum. The technique succeeds not through strength but through the systematic exploitation of angular momentum and balance disruption."
- **Gordon Ryan**: "In competition, the berimbolo has become one of the most high-percentage back-taking techniques from De La Riva guard. I've used it countless times to score back points and secure wins. The critical element is committing fully to the inversion - hesitation allows your opponent to sprawl or counter. I focus on making my ankle control unbreakable and my rotation continuous. Once you're underneath and rotating, they have limited options to defend. The transition from guard to back control can happen in 2-3 seconds at high level."
- **Eddie Bravo**: "While the berimbolo comes from the sport BJJ evolution, it demonstrates important principles about using unconventional movements to create angles. In 10th Planet, we've integrated similar inversion concepts with our system. The key is understanding that modern guard play isn't just about sweeps and submissions from bottom - it's about creating pathways to dominant positions through athletic movement. The berimbolo opened up a whole new dimension of back attacks that changed competitive grappling."

Each insight should focus on one key technical or strategic element.

### Common Errors
For knowledge test generation:
- **Error**: Insufficient ankle control during inversion
- **Why It Fails**: Opponent can pull leg free and counter with pass or pressure
- **Correction**: Maintain death grip on ankle throughout entire rotation
- **Recognition**: Opponent easily frees leg during berimbolo attempt

- **Error**: Incomplete inversion or rotation
- **Why It Fails**: Ends in disadvantaged position under opponent's pressure
- **Correction**: Commit fully to rotation with continuous spiral movement
- **Recognition**: Getting stuck inverted under opponent's weight

- **Error**: Poor timing of entry initiation
- **Why It Fails**: Opponent has time to sit or sprawl to prevent rotation
- **Correction**: Time entry when opponent is shifting weight or committing to pass
- **Recognition**: Opponent easily defends with base before rotation begins

- **Error**: Releasing collar grip too early
- **Why It Fails**: Loses control of upper body during rotation
- **Correction**: Maintain collar control until fully behind opponent
- **Recognition**: Opponent turns to face during back take attempt

- **Error**: Failing to thread leg through during rotation
- **Why It Fails**: Cannot complete back take or ends in scramble
- **Correction**: Actively thread hooking leg through as you rotate
- **Recognition**: Ending on side or bottom instead of behind opponent

### Timing Considerations
When to attempt this transition:
- **Optimal Conditions**: When opponent is standing or passing with forward pressure
- **Avoid When**: Opponent has solid combat base or is sitting back
- **Setup Sequences**: After establishing strong De La Riva guard with ankle control
- **Follow-up Windows**: Must complete rotation within 3-4 seconds before counter

### Prerequisites
Requirements before attempting:
- **Technical Skills**: Strong De La Riva guard and inversion ability
- **Physical Preparation**: Flexibility for inversion and core strength for rotation
- **Positional Understanding**: De La Riva mechanics and back-taking principles
- **Experience Level**: Advanced technique requiring significant training and athleticism

## Technical Assessment Elements

### Knowledge Assessment Questions
5 technical questions with multiple choice answers:
