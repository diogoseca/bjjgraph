### Visual Execution Sequence
Detailed step-by-step description for clear movement sequence visualization:

From an Open Guard Bottom or De La Riva Guard position, you start on your back or seated, facing the opponent who is standing or kneeling in your guard, with one of your feet hooked behind their ankle (often the near leg in De La Riva) or placed on their hip for control, while your other foot is positioned on the mat or their other hip to create a tripod base, and you secure a strong grip on their ankle or pants at the cuff with one hand, maintaining control of their posture with your other hand gripping their sleeve or collar. You maintain a tight connection with your legs and grips, keeping your elbows close to your body to prevent them from pulling out, while your head is positioned defensively to avoid being easily passed, ensuring your hips are slightly elevated or angled to prepare for the sweep, as you use your core to maintain tension and control their forward movement. As you initiate the sweep, you pull on their ankle with your grip while simultaneously pushing with your hooked foot or hip foot to off-balance them backward or to the side, using your other leg on the mat as a tripod point to post and drive your hips upward, creating the leverage to topple them, while your sleeve or collar grip assists in pulling their upper body down or to the side to complete the imbalance. With the opponent off-balanced, you continue the motion by driving forward with your hips and posting leg, rolling them over their trapped ankle or hip, maintaining control of their leg and upper body as they fall to their back or side, ensuring you follow through by coming up on top, often landing in a top position like side control or directly into mount if their defenses are open. You consolidate the position by securing an underhook or crossface to prevent their immediate escape, having successfully reversed the position from bottom guard to top dominance through a fundamental open guard sweep.

**Template**: "From Open Guard Bottom or De La Riva Guard, hook foot behind ankle or on hip, other foot on mat or hip for tripod base, grip ankle/pants and sleeve/collar. Maintain tight connection, keep elbows in, elevate hips for sweep preparation. Pull ankle, push with hooked foot, post on tripod leg, drive hips up to off-balance opponent backward/sideways. Roll opponent over trapped ankle/hip, follow through to top position or side control. Consolidate with underhook/crossface to secure dominance."

### Execution Steps (Numbered Sequence)
1. **Setup Requirements**: Start in Open Guard Bottom or De La Riva Guard
2. **Leg Positioning**: Hook one foot behind opponent's ankle or on hip, other foot on mat/hip for tripod
3. **Grip Establishment**: Secure ankle/pants grip with one hand, sleeve/collar grip with other
4. **Posture Control**: Maintain tight connection, elbows in, control opponent's forward movement
5. **Hip Preparation**: Elevate or angle hips, engage core for leverage and tension
6. **Off-Balance Action**: Pull ankle grip, push with hooked foot, post on tripod leg to unbalance
7. **Hip Drive**: Drive hips upward, use tripod base to topple opponent backward or sideways
8. **Sweep Completion**: Roll opponent over trapped ankle/hip, maintain leg and upper body control
9. **Position Transition**: Follow through to come up on top, land in side control or mount
10. **Position Consolidation**: Secure underhook or crossface to prevent immediate escape

### Key Technical Details
Critical elements that determine success:
- **Ankle Grip**: Strong control of opponent's ankle or pants to pull and trap leg
- **Tripod Base**: Stable posting leg on mat or hip to drive hips and create leverage
- **Hip Movement**: Active hip elevation and drive to off-balance opponent
- **Upper Body Control**: Sleeve or collar grip to pull opponent's posture down or sideways
- **Follow-Through**: Continuous motion to come up on top after sweep

### Success Modifiers
Factors that increase/decrease probability:
- **Grip Strength**: Effectiveness of ankle and sleeve/collar control (+/-20%)
- **Opponent Posture**: Degree of forward lean or imbalance (+/-15%)
- **Hip Mobility**: Ability to elevate and drive hips dynamically (+/-15%)
- **Tripod Stability**: Strength of posting leg for leverage (+/-10%)
- **Knowledge Test Performance**: Understanding open guard sweep mechanics (+/-10%)

## Counter-Attack Analysis

### Common Counters
Opponent responses with success rates:
- **Posture Recovery**: Stepping back to regain balance → [[Open Guard Top]] (Success Rate: 40%, Conditions: early recognition)
- **Base Widening**: Lowering center of gravity to resist sweep → [[Top Open Guard]] (Success Rate: 30%, Conditions: quick reaction)
- **Leg Freeing**: Pulling trapped leg free from grip → [[Neutral Position]] (Success Rate: 20%, Conditions: strong grip break)
- **Counter Sweep**: Using sweep momentum for own attack → [[Top Position]] (Success Rate: 10%, Conditions: advanced skill)

Format: `[[Counter Technique]] → [[Result State]] (Success Rate: X%, Conditions: [when applicable])`

### Decision Logic
```
If [sweep setup] is recognized early:
- Execute [[Posture Recovery]] (Probability: 40%)

Else if [center of gravity] can be lowered quickly:
- Execute [[Base Widening]] (Probability: 30%)

Else if [grip break] can free trapped leg:
- Attempt [[Leg Freeing]] (Probability: 20%)

Else [advanced skill] allows counter attack:
- Attempt [[Counter Sweep]] (Probability: 10%)

Else [optimal execution]:
- Accept transition (Probability: Success Rate - Modifiers)
```

## Educational Content

### Expert Insights
Commentary as if from recognized authorities:
- **John Danaher**: "The Tripod Sweep is a fundamental open guard technique that exemplifies the principle of using a stable base to create leverage for sweeping. The key is in the tripod configuration of your legs and the coordinated pulling and pushing actions to off-balance the opponent, demonstrating how structural stability can overcome strength. This sweep teaches critical principles of balance disruption that are essential for all guard systems."
- **Gordon Ryan**: "In competition, the Tripod Sweep is a high-percentage move from open guard, especially against standing opponents who overcommit forward. I focus on securing the ankle grip and using my tripod leg to drive my hips up explosively for the sweep. This technique shows how simple mechanics can be adapted into powerful attacks from the bottom."
- **Eddie Bravo**: "Tripod Sweep is a slick fundamental sweep that blends classic open guard with modern De La Riva concepts, offering a reliable way to reverse position. It’s a great move for grapplers who like to control the legs and create dynamic sweeps, often chaining into other attacks. This sweep integrates well with systems that prioritize fluid transitions and off-balancing from the guard."

Each insight should focus on one key technical or strategic element.

### Common Errors
For knowledge test generation:
- **Error**: Weak ankle grip or insufficient pull
- **Why It Fails**: Lacks control to trap opponent's leg and create off-balance
- **Correction**: Secure strong grip on ankle or pants, pull with intent to disrupt balance
- **Recognition**: Opponent easily steps out or maintains posture

- **Error**: Poor tripod base or unstable posting leg
- **Why It Fails**: Reduces leverage for hip drive, making sweep ineffective
- **Correction**: Ensure posting leg is firmly on mat or hip for stable tripod base
- **Recognition**: Sweep stalls or hips collapse during drive

- **Error**: Lack of hip elevation or drive
- **Why It Fails**: Fails to generate enough force to topple opponent
- **Correction**: Actively elevate hips and drive upward using tripod leg
- **Recognition**: Opponent remains balanced or counters with posture recovery

### Timing Considerations
When to attempt this transition:
- **Optimal Conditions**: When opponent stands or leans forward in open guard
- **Avoid When**: Opponent maintains low, defensive posture with strong base
- **Setup Sequences**: After establishing ankle and sleeve/collar grips for control
- **Follow-up Windows**: Must complete sweep within 3-5 seconds to avoid counters

- **Technical Skills**: Understanding of open guard principles and sweep mechanics
- **Physical Preparation**: Hip mobility and core strength for driving motion
