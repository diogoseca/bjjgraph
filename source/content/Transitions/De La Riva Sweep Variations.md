# De La Riva Sweep Variations
#bjj #transition #sweep #de_la_riva #advanced

## Visual Execution Sequence

From De La Riva Guard, you establish a deep DLR hook behind your opponent's near leg while controlling their opposite collar and sleeve. Your opponent typically pressures forward attempting to establish passing grips or drive into leg drag position. You then create off-balancing angles by pulling their sleeve across their body while extending your DLR hook and pushing with your free foot on their hip or thigh. The combination of hook extension, grip manipulation, and opposing forces creates multiple sweep directions - backward tomahawk sweep, forward baby bolo, or lateral hook sweep - depending on their balance reaction, resulting in top position with control established.

**One-Sentence Summary**: "From De La Riva Guard with collar-sleeve control, you use hook extension and grip manipulation to create multiple sweep angles, sweeping to dominant top position based on opponent's balance response."

## Execution Steps

1. **Setup Requirements**: Establish deep DLR hook behind opponent's near leg, secure collar grip with one hand and sleeve grip with other hand, free foot positioned on hip or opposite thigh
2. **Initial Movement**: Pull sleeve across opponent's centerline while extending DLR hook to compromise their base and create off-balancing tension
3. **Opponent Response**: Opponent typically reacts by posting far leg, circling away, or driving pressure forward to counter the sweep threat
4. **Adaptation**: Read opponent's weight distribution and base reaction - if posting back choose tomahawk sweep, if circling away execute baby bolo entry, if driving forward use forward hook sweep
5. **Execution Options**: Execute chosen sweep variation with coordinated hook extension, grip pull direction, and hip movement to complete off-balance
6. **Completion**: Follow opponent's falling direction while maintaining grips, transition to side control or knee on belly based on sweep angle
7. **Consolidation**: Secure crossface and underhook control in side control, establish stable top position before opponent can recover guard

## Key Technical Details

- **Grip Requirements**: Deep collar grip at shoulder level provides steering control, sleeve grip at elbow or wrist level enables arm isolation and pulling across centerline
- **Base/Foundation**: DLR hook must be deep with foot behind opponent's knee, inside foot on hip creates pushing frame for angle creation and base disruption
- **Timing Windows**: Execute when opponent's weight commits to countering sweep direction, creating vulnerability to opposite angle or alternative sweep option
- **Leverage Points**: DLR hook extension creates backward lever, collar pull creates rotational force, sleeve control prevents defensive posting with isolated arm
- **Common Adjustments**: Adjust sweep direction dynamically based on opponent's base adjustments - three primary variations provide complete coverage of defensive reactions

## Common Counters

Opponent defensive responses with success rates and conditions:

- **[[Leg Drag Defense]]** → [[Half Guard Top]] (Success Rate: 45%, Conditions: quick backstep and clear DLR hook before sweep initiates)
- **[[Smash Pass]]** → [[Side Control Top]] (Success Rate: 40%, Conditions: drive weight forward over guard, pressure through sweep attempt)
- **[[Base Out Wide]]** → [[De La Riva Guard]] (Success Rate: 50%, Conditions: establish wide base with strong posting before off-balance occurs)
- **[[Step Over DLR]]** → [[Headquarters Position]] (Success Rate: 35%, Conditions: circle away from hook while maintaining posture and pressure)

### Decision Logic for AI Opponent

```
If [setup quality] < 50%:
- Execute [[Leg Drag Defense]] (Probability: 45%)

Else if [base established] wide and stable:
- Execute [[Base Out Wide]] (Probability: 50%)

Else if [sweep momentum] detected early:
- Execute [[Smash Pass]] (Probability: 40%)

Else if [DLR hook] not deep:
- Execute [[Step Over DLR]] (Probability: 35%)

Else [optimal execution conditions]:
- Accept transition (Probability: Base Success Rate + Applied Modifiers)
```

## Expert Insights

### John Danaher
"The De La Riva guard represents a sophisticated system where the hook creates a fundamental mechanical problem for the top person. The key understanding is that multiple sweep variations from DLR aren't random - they form a systematic response to opponent's defensive choices. Each sweep direction counters a specific defensive reaction, creating a rock-paper-scissors scenario where proper reads make the position nearly unstoppable. The collar-sleeve combination provides both distance management and directional steering, while the DLR hook serves as the primary off-balancing tool."

### Gordon Ryan
"In competition, DLR sweep variations are extremely high percentage once you develop the sensitivity to read which direction opponent is defending. I focus on three primary sweeps - tomahawk when they post back, baby bolo when they circle, and forward sweep when they pressure in. The grip fighting before establishing DLR is crucial - without proper collar-sleeve control, the sweeps lose effectiveness. I train the transition between sweep options as one fluid motion, so opponent never has time to fully establish defensive base."

### Eddie Bravo
"De La Riva represents the evolution of guard play into dynamic, angle-based sweeping systems. The hook creates asymmetry that opponent struggles to resolve without creating sweep opportunities. I emphasize developing both gi and no-gi versions - no-gi DLR requires different grip strategies but the mechanical principles remain consistent. The position integrates perfectly with leg lock systems, as failed sweep attempts often create excellent entries to 50-50 or ashi garami positions. Modern sport jiu-jitsu has made DLR mastery essential."

## Common Errors

### Error 1: Shallow DLR hook without foot behind opponent's knee
- **Why It Fails**: Insufficient leverage for off-balancing, opponent easily clears hook with simple backstep motion
- **Correction**: Drive foot deep behind knee before attempting sweeps, ensure hook placement is secure and creates mechanical disadvantage for opponent
- **Recognition**: Opponent easily escapes DLR with minimal defensive effort, hook feels weak and easily cleared

### Error 2: Static DLR position without creating off-balancing angles
- **Why It Fails**: Allows opponent to establish strong base and defensive grips before sweep initiation
- **Correction**: Constantly create tension with hook extension and grip pulls, prevent opponent from settling into stable position
- **Recognition**: Opponent feels comfortable in your DLR guard, easily maintains posture and base

### Error 3: Committing to single sweep direction despite opponent's defensive adjustment
- **Why It Fails**: Fails to exploit vulnerability created by opponent's defensive commitment, forces low-percentage sweep against established defense
- **Correction**: Read opponent's base and weight distribution, fluidly transition between sweep variations based on defensive reactions
- **Recognition**: Repeatedly attempting same sweep despite opponent successfully defending, feeling stuck in single pattern

### Error 4: Poor collar grip placement too high on lapel
- **Why It Fails**: Reduces leverage for directional control, allows opponent to maintain upright posture during sweep attempts
- **Correction**: Establish collar grip at shoulder level or lower, ensure grip provides downward pulling angle for posture breaking
- **Recognition**: Sweeps lack power and opponent maintains strong posture throughout attempts

### Error 5: Not maintaining sleeve control throughout sweep execution
- **Why It Fails**: Allows opponent to post defensive hand and block sweep, loses directional steering capability
- **Correction**: Keep sleeve grip tight through entire sweep motion, prevent opponent's arm from creating defensive frame
- **Recognition**: Opponent successfully posts hand to stop sweep momentum, loses sweep despite good initial setup

## Timing Considerations

- **Optimal Conditions**: When opponent is actively attempting to pass and committing weight to passing direction, when opponent's base becomes narrow during grip fighting, immediately after opponent clears one sweep attempt and shifts weight to new direction
- **Avoid When**: When opponent has established strong crossface or has cleared DLR hook to outside position, when fatigued and unable to generate explosive sweep momentum, when opponent has double underhook control or body lock
- **Setup Sequences**: After threatening berimbolo to bring opponent's posture upright, following failed triangle or omoplata attempt from DLR, after opponent successfully defends initial sweep attempt and commits to counter-passing
- **Follow-up Windows**: Must transition smoothly to top position within 2-3 seconds after sweep initiation, failure to complete transition allows opponent to recover guard or create scramble situation

## Prerequisites

- **Technical Skills**: Proficient DLR guard retention, [[Berimbolo]], [[X-Guard]] entry and maintenance, basic sweep mechanics and timing understanding
- **Physical Preparation**: Hip flexibility for deep DLR hook, leg strength for maintaining hook pressure, core strength for dynamic angle changes, shoulder flexibility for collar-sleeve grip maintenance
- **Positional Understanding**: Guard hierarchy and retention principles, angle creation and off-balancing mechanics, grip fighting strategy and priority systems
- **Experience Level**: Advanced technique requiring significant training time, recommended for purple belt and above after mastering fundamental open guard concepts

## Knowledge Assessment

1. **Mechanical Understanding**: "What creates the primary off-balancing force in DLR sweep variations?"
   - A) Only the DLR hook extension
   - B) Only the collar and sleeve grip pulls
   - C) The combination of hook extension, grip manipulation, and opposing forces with hip push
   - D) The inside foot push on opponent's hip
   - **Answer**: C

2. **Timing Recognition**: "When is the optimal moment to execute DLR sweep variations?"
   - A) When opponent has wide stable base with minimal movement
   - B) When opponent is actively passing and committing weight to passing direction
   - C) When fatigued and unable to generate explosive movement
   - D) When opponent has double underhook control
   - **Answer**: B

3. **Error Prevention**: "What is the most common grip mistake in DLR sweeps?"
   - A) Gripping collar too high on lapel reducing leverage
   - B) Using both hands on same side
   - C) Releasing grips too early during execution
   - D) Gripping opponent's pants instead of sleeve
   - **Answer**: A

4. **Setup Requirements**: "What must be established before attempting DLR sweep variations?"
   - A) Both feet on opponent's hips
   - B) Deep DLR hook behind knee with collar-sleeve control
   - C) Double collar grips
   - D) Closed guard position
   - **Answer**: B

5. **Adaptation**: "How should you adjust if opponent bases out wide and prevents your chosen sweep?"
   - A) Force the same sweep harder with more power
   - B) Release DLR and return to closed guard
   - C) Fluidly transition to alternative sweep variation based on their new weight distribution
   - D) Abandon sweep and pull to deep half guard
   - **Answer**: C

## Variants and Adaptations

- **Gi Specific**: Traditional collar-sleeve grips provide maximum control and leverage, lapel grip variations can replace collar grip for different angles, pants grip at knee complements DLR hook for enhanced control
- **No-Gi Specific**: Adapt to overhook-underhook control instead of collar-sleeve, wrist control replaces sleeve grip for arm isolation, position requires tighter distance management without gi friction
- **Self-Defense**: Limited street application due to complexity and ground fighting context, guard retention concepts transfer to defensive scenarios
- **Competition**: Highly effective in sport jiu-jitsu point scoring, excellent for creating sweep points and advantageous positions, integrates with modern leg lock systems for submission-only formats
- **Size Differential**: Smaller practitioners gain significant advantage through superior hook mechanics and angle creation, larger opponents may struggle with flexibility requirements for deep DLR hook, technique highly effective for lighter competitors against heavier opponents

## Training Progressions

1. **Solo Practice**: DLR hook placement and extension mechanics without partner, collar-sleeve grip positioning and pull directions on dummy or stationary partner, hip movement and angle creation patterns
2. **Cooperative Drilling**: Partner allows sweep completion in three directions (tomahawk, baby bolo, forward) for motor pattern development, practice reading base and weight distribution with partner providing clear defensive signals
3. **Resistant Practice**: Partner provides progressive defensive resistance with specific defensive patterns (posting back, circling, driving forward), practice transitioning between sweep variations in response to changing defenses
4. **Sparring Integration**: Implement DLR sweeps during positional sparring from open guard, develop entry sequences from standing or other guard positions, practice chaining sweeps with back takes and leg lock entries
5. **Troubleshooting**: Address common defensive counters (leg drag, smash pass, step over), refine grip fighting to achieve optimal hand positions before sweep attempts, develop contingency plans for failed sweeps (back take, leg locks, guard recovery)

### Common Troubleshooting Patterns

```yaml
troubleshooting:
  - symptom: "DLR hook constantly getting cleared by opponent's backstep"
    likely_cause: "Hook placement too shallow or insufficient tension maintenance"
    diagnostic_questions:
      - "Is your foot positioned behind opponent's knee or just at calf level?"
      - "Are you maintaining constant extension pressure with DLR hook?"
      - "Is your opposite foot creating push tension on hip to prevent circle?"
    solution: "Drive foot deeper behind knee before opponent establishes passing position, create constant tension with hook extension, coordinate with hip push from opposite foot"

  - symptom: "Sweeps lack power and opponent maintains balance easily"
    likely_cause: "Poor grip positioning or failure to coordinate grips with hook"
    diagnostic_questions:
      - "Is collar grip at shoulder level or higher on lapel?"
      - "Are you pulling sleeve across opponent's centerline?"
      - "Are grip pulls coordinated with hook extension timing?"
    solution: "Reposition collar grip lower at shoulder, actively pull sleeve across body, synchronize grip pulls with explosive hook extension"

  - symptom: "Getting stuck on single sweep attempt despite opponent's defensive adjustment"
    likely_cause: "Insufficient sensitivity to opponent's weight distribution and base changes"
    diagnostic_questions:
      - "Are you reading opponent's base width and weight commitment?"
      - "Can you feel which direction has sweep vulnerability?"
      - "Are you drilling all three primary sweep variations?"
    solution: "Develop proprioceptive sensitivity through specific drilling, practice rapid transitions between sweep options, learn to read subtle weight shifts that indicate vulnerability"

  - symptom: "Opponent successfully leg dragging before sweep can develop"
    likely_cause: "Delayed sweep initiation or inadequate grip control during entry"
    diagnostic_questions:
      - "Are you establishing collar-sleeve before opponent gets passing grips?"
      - "Is your inside foot creating active frame on hip?"
      - "Are you creating off-balancing immediately upon DLR establishment?"
    solution: "Win grip fighting battle before DLR entry, maintain active frames with inside foot, initiate sweep threat immediately rather than settling into static position"

## Competition Applications

- **IBJJF Rules**: Legal at all belt levels, scores as sweep (2 points) plus potential knee on belly (2 points) or back take (4 points), excellent for points-based strategy
- **No-Gi Competition**: Requires modified grip strategy with overhook-underhook control, equally effective in submission-only formats when combined with leg lock transitions
- **Self-Defense Context**: Limited practical application in street self-defense, guard retention principles transfer to defensive ground scenarios
- **MMA Applications**: Modified versions possible but higher risk due to strikes, guard retention concepts useful for preventing ground-and-pound, DLR hook mechanics applicable to cage wrestling

## Historical Context

The De La Riva guard was developed by Ricardo De La Riva in the 1980s and revolutionized open guard play in Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu. The sweep variations evolved through competition as top-level players developed counter-systems, forcing DLR specialists to create multiple sweep options from the same position. Modern sport jiu-jitsu has made DLR sweep mastery essential for competitive success, with athletes like the Miyao brothers, Lachlan Giles, and Mikey Musumeci pushing the position's evolution.

## Safety Considerations

- **Controlled Application**: Smooth sweep execution prevents knee strain on DLR hook leg, avoid explosive lateral forces that could injure opponent's trapped leg
- **Mat Awareness**: Ensure adequate space for full sweep rotation, be mindful of training area boundaries
- **Partner Safety**: Control opponent's descent to prevent hard landing, maintain grips through completion to guide safe landing
- **Gradual Progression**: Build up sweep speed and power gradually, start with cooperative drilling to develop proper mechanics and sensitivity

## Position Integration

**Common combinations and sequences:**
- [[De La Riva Guard]] → [[De La Riva Sweep Variations]] → [[Side Control Top]]
- [[De La Riva Guard]] → [[De La Riva Sweep Variations]] → [[Berimbolo]] (if opponent defends sweep)
- [[De La Riva Guard]] → [[De La Riva Sweep Variations]] → [[Single Leg X Entry]] (if sweep incomplete)
- [[X-Guard]] → [[De La Riva Guard]] → [[De La Riva Sweep Variations]] (transition sweep)
