#bjj #standard #transitions #statemachine

## Overview
This document defines the required structure and content for all transition files in the BJJ state machine. Every transition must include the standardized elements below to ensure proper integration with state machine processing, probability calculations, technical analysis, and comprehensive documentation.

## Required Properties for State Machine

### Core Identifiers
- **Transition ID**: Unique identifier (format: T###, e.g., T904)
- **Transition Name**: Clear, descriptive name matching filename
- **Alternative Names**: Common alternative terminology or variations

### State Machine Properties
- **Starting State**: Position where transition begins (must link to existing position)
- **Ending State**: Position where transition ends (must link to existing position)
- **Transition Type**: [Escape/Attack/Advancement/Counter/Setup] - categorizes transition purpose

### Transition Properties
- **Success Probability**: [Beginner X%, Intermediate Y%, Advanced Z%] - core probability data
- **Execution Complexity**: [Low/Medium/High] - technical difficulty assessment
- **Energy Cost**: [Low/Medium/High] - physical demand of execution
- **Time Required**: [Instant/Quick/Medium/Slow] - duration of transition
- **Risk Level**: [Low/Medium/High] - chance of backfire or position loss

### Physical Requirements
- **Strength Requirements**: [Low/Medium/High] for different muscle groups
- **Flexibility Requirements**: [Low/Medium/High] for joints/mobility
- **Coordination Requirements**: [Low/Medium/High] for technical precision
- **Speed Requirements**: [Low/Medium/High] for timing-dependent execution

## State Machine Content Elements

### Visual Execution Sequence
Detailed step-by-step description for:
- Clear movement sequence visualization
- Technical instruction and understanding
- Precise body mechanics and positioning
- Key pressure points and leverage applications

**Template**: "From [starting position], you [action 1]. Your opponent [typical reaction]. You then [action 2], [specific body mechanics], resulting in [ending position]."

### Execution Steps (Numbered Sequence)
1. **Setup Requirements**: Conditions that must be met before attempting
2. **Initial Movement**: First action in the sequence
3. **Opponent Response**: Expected defensive reaction
4. **Adaptation**: How to adjust based on opponent response
5. **Completion**: Final movement to achieve ending state
6. **Consolidation**: How to secure the new position

### Key Technical Details
Critical elements that determine success:
- **Grip Requirements**: Specific hand/arm positioning
- **Base/Foundation**: Foot placement and weight distribution
- **Timing Windows**: When to initiate and complete each phase
- **Leverage Points**: Where to apply force and pressure
- **Common Adjustments**: Micro-corrections during execution

### Success Modifiers
Factors that increase/decrease probability:
- **Setup Quality**: How well prerequisites are established (+/-10%)
- **Timing Precision**: Execution during optimal windows (+/-15%)
- **Opponent Fatigue**: Energy state affects defensive capability (+/-5%)
- **Knowledge Test Performance**: Correct understanding (+/-10%)
- **Position Control**: Quality of starting position control (+/-5%)

## Counter-Attack Analysis

### Common Counters
Opponent responses with success rates:
- **Defensive Counter**: How opponent defends with probability
- **Aggressive Counter**: How opponent counter-attacks with probability
- **Positional Counter**: How opponent maintains/improves position
- **Scramble Response**: Chaotic reactions and their outcomes

Format: `[[Counter Technique]] â†’ [[Result State]] (Success Rate: X%, Conditions: [when applicable])`

### Decision Logic
```
If [setup quality] < 50%:
- Execute [[Defensive Counter]] (Probability: X%)

Else if [timing] is off:
- Execute [[Aggressive Counter]] (Probability: Y%)

Else if [opponent has energy advantage]:
- Execute [[Scramble Response]] (Probability: Z%)

Else [optimal execution]:
- Accept transition (Probability: Success Rate - Modifiers)
```

## Educational Content

## Technical Assessment Elements

### Knowledge Assessment Questions
5 technical questions with multiple choice answers:

- **Timing Recognition**: "When is the optimal moment to execute?"
- **Error Prevention**: "What is the most common mistake?"
- **Setup Requirements**: "What must be established before attempting?"
- **Adaptation**: "How do you adjust if opponent responds with X?"

### Variants and Adaptations
Different versions for various scenarios:
- **Gi Specific**: Adjustments when wearing the uniform
- **No-Gi Specific**: Grip and control modifications
- **Self-Defense**: Street application considerations
- **Competition**: Rule-set specific optimizations
- **Size Differential**: Adjustments for height/weight differences

### Training Progressions
Skill development pathway:
