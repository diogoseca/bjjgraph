# Kimura to Back Take
#bjj #transition #kimura #back_control #advancement

## Visual Execution Sequence

With kimura grip established, you use the shoulder lock control to manipulate your opponent's posture and positioning. As they defend the kimura by turning or moving, you release the submission attempt and immediately transition to their back, securing hooks and establishing back control. The kimura grip serves as powerful positional control that opens the path to dominant back position.

**One-Sentence Summary**: "From kimura control, use shoulder lock pressure to create back exposure, transition to hooks, establish back control."

## Execution Steps

1. **Kimura Control**: Establish figure-four kimura grip from any position
2. **Pressure Application**: Apply kimura pressure to force opponent's reaction
3. **Recognition**: Identify moment when opponent turns to defend shoulder
4. **Release and Transition**: Release kimura grip, immediately pursue back
5. **Hook Insertion**: Secure first hook as opponent turns
6. **Consolidation**: Complete back take with both hooks and control

## Key Technical Details

- **Grip Requirements**: Strong kimura that creates defensive reaction
- **Base/Foundation**: Maintain top position throughout transition
- **Timing Windows**: Execute when opponent turns to relieve shoulder pressure
- **Leverage Points**: Kimura pressure + opponent's defensive turn = back exposure
- **Common Adjustments**: Adjust hook insertion based on opponent's turning direction

## Common Counters

- **[[Defend Shoulder Without Turning]]** → [[Kimura Defense]] (Success Rate: 40%)
- **[[Counter Roll]]** → [[Scramble]] (Success Rate: 30%)
- **[[Aggressive Escape]]** → [[Stand Up]] (Success Rate: 25%)

### Decision Logic
```
If [kimura defended without turning]:
- Execute [[Stay Flat Defense]] (Probability: 40%)

Else if [back take initiated]:
- Execute [[Counter Roll]] (Probability: 30%)

Else [successful transition]:
- Accept back control (Base Success Rate)
```

## Expert Insights

### John Danaher
"The kimura is perhaps the most versatile control position in jiu-jitsu. Its value lies not just in the submission but in the positional control it provides. The back take from kimura is natural - as opponent defends shoulder by turning, their back becomes exposed. This is systematic advancement."

### Gordon Ryan
"Kimura to back is one of my highest percentage transitions. Opponent's defensive instinct - turning away from the shoulder lock - gives me exactly what I want: back exposure. I'll often threaten kimura specifically to create this back take opportunity."

### Eddie Bravo
"In the system, kimura connects to everything - back takes, sweeps, submissions. The back take is especially high percentage because opponent's defensive movement does our work for us. Control the shoulder, control the position."

## Common Errors

### Error 1: Releasing Kimura Too Early
- **Why It Fails**: Opponent hasn't committed to turn, back not exposed
- **Correction**: Maintain kimura pressure until clear turning reaction
- **Recognition**: Attempting back take without opponent movement

### Error 2: Losing Top Position During Transition
- **Why It Fails**: Falling or getting swept during transition
- **Correction**: Maintain base and weight control throughout
- **Recognition**: Ending in bottom or scramble position

### Error 3: Slow Hook Insertion
- **Why It Fails**: Opponent recognizes back take and defends
- **Correction**: Immediate hook insertion as they turn
- **Recognition**: Struggling to secure hooks after transition

## Timing Considerations

- **Optimal Conditions**: Kimura locked, opponent turning to relieve pressure
- **Avoid When**: Opponent remains flat and doesn't react to kimura
- **Setup Sequences**: From any position with kimura control established
- **Follow-up Windows**: Must secure hooks within 2-3 seconds of release

## Prerequisites

- **Technical Skills**: Kimura grip fundamentals, back take basics
- **Physical Preparation**: Basic core strength and coordination
- **Positional Understanding**: Kimura control mechanics, back control principles
- **Experience Level**: Beginner-Intermediate - accessible yet effective

## Knowledge Assessment

1. **When to transition?** When opponent turns to defend kimura shoulder pressure
2. **What creates the opportunity?** Opponent's defensive reaction to shoulder lock
3. **Primary risk?** Releasing kimura before opponent commits to turn
4. **Hook priority?** Near-side hook first as they turn
5. **Success factor?** Maintaining top pressure while transitioning

## Variants and Adaptations

- **Gi Specific**: Can maintain lapel grip during transition
- **No-Gi Specific**: Must rely on hooks immediately, no gi friction
- **From Turtle**: Highest success rate - limited defensive options
- **From Half Guard**: Requires more technical precision
- **From Mount**: Very high percentage when opponent bridges

## Training Progressions

1. **Cooperative Drilling**: Partner turns on cue from kimura pressure
2. **Resistant Practice**: Partner provides progressive defensive reaction
3. **Situational Sparring**: Start from kimura control, attempt back take
4. **Live Rolling**: Integrate from various positions
5. **Troubleshooting**: Identify and correct timing issues

## Competition Applications

- **IBJJF Rules**: Back control scores 4 points - high value transition
- **No-Gi Competition**: Extremely effective for point accumulation
- **MMA Applications**: Back control provides striking advantage
