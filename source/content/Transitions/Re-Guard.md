# Re-Guard
#bjj #transition #escape #defense #guard_recovery

## Visual Execution Sequence

From [[Side Control Bottom]], you are pinned with opponent's chest pressure controlling your upper body and their hips blocking your movement. You create frames with your near forearm against their neck and your far hand on their hip, establishing defensive structure. You execute a powerful hip escape, sliding your hips away from their control while maintaining frames to prevent them from following. Your near knee inserts between your body and their torso, creating a wedge that blocks their advancement. You thread your far leg through the created space while your frames keep them at distance, beginning to construct your guard structure. Your legs wrap around their torso, ankles locking behind their back, transforming from defensive bottom position to offensive [[Closed Guard Bottom]] with control reestablished.

**One-Sentence Summary**: "From side control with defensive frames, you hip escape to create space, insert your knee as a barrier, thread your far leg through, and establish closed guard with hooks locked."

## Execution Steps

1. **Frame Creation**: Establish frames with near forearm on neck and far hand on hip, creating initial defensive structure
2. **Hip Escape**: Execute shrimp movement to slide hips away from opponent's control, creating separation
3. **Knee Insertion**: Insert near knee between bodies as barrier, preventing opponent from closing distance
4. **Guard Construction**: Thread far leg through space while maintaining frames, beginning guard recovery
5. **Hook Establishment**: Lock ankles behind opponent's back or establish open guard hooks and grips
6. **Position Consolidation**: Secure guard with proper grips and posture control, transitioning to offensive mindset

## Key Technical Details

- **Grip Requirements**: Strong frames on neck and hip to create and maintain space during escape
- **Base/Foundation**: Hip mobility and bridge strength to generate escape power
- **Timing Windows**: Execute during opponent's weight shifts or when they adjust position
- **Leverage Points**: Using frames as fulcrums while hip escaping to maximize distance creation
- **Common Adjustments**: Adjusting frame pressure and hip angle based on opponent's weight distribution and reactions

## Common Counters

Opponent defensive responses with success rates and conditions:

- [[Pressure Pass]] → [[Side Control Top]] (Success Rate: 45%, Conditions: opponent drives weight forward to prevent hip escape)
- [[Crossface Control]] → [[Side Control Top]] (Success Rate: 40%, Conditions: opponent establishes heavy crossface blocking frames)
- [[Knee Slice]] → [[Mount]] (Success Rate: 35%, Conditions: opponent anticipates knee insertion and slices through)
- [[Backstep]] → [[Back Control]] (Success Rate: 30%, Conditions: opponent takes back as you turn)

### Decision Logic for AI Opponent

```
If [frames not established] AND [pressure is heavy]:
- Execute [[Pressure Pass]] (Probability: 45%)

Else if [hip escape initiated] AND [space created]:
- Execute [[Knee Slice]] (Probability: 35%)

Else if [knee inserted] but [not fully recovered]:
- Execute [[Crossface Control]] (Probability: 40%)

Else [guard being established]:
- Accept transition (Probability: Base Success Rate - Applied Modifiers)
```

## Expert Insights

### John Danaher
"The re-guard is fundamentally about creating and managing distance through frames and hip movement. The critical principle is that frames without hip escape accomplish nothing - you must combine defensive structure with offensive movement. The knee insertion is the pivotal moment; once that barrier is established, the opponent's path to maintaining side control is significantly diminished. Focus on the quality of your frames and the timing of your hip escape - these two elements working in concert make re-guard nearly inevitable."

### Gordon Ryan
"In competition, I see opponents try to hold side control when I'm re-guarding, and it rarely works if my frames are solid. The key is not waiting - you must frame and escape immediately, before they consolidate their weight. I focus on creating maximum distance with my hip escape so that my knee insertion is easy. Once my legs are in play, side control is over. Your training partners should learn that holding side control against active frames and hip movement is a losing battle."

### Eddie Bravo
"Re-guard is where 10th Planet philosophy really shines - we don't accept bottom position passively. The moment you're in side control, you're already working back to guard. We drill this constantly because guard is where our game starts. The lockdown, rubber guard, and all our attacks come from guard positions. Master the re-guard and you're never truly stuck on bottom. Be relentless with frame maintenance and hip escape timing."

## Common Errors

### Error 1: Weak or Absent Frames
- **Why It Fails**: Without strong frames, opponent easily follows your hip escape and maintains pressure
- **Correction**: Establish firm frames before attempting hip escape, maintain frame pressure throughout
- **Recognition**: Opponent easily closes distance after your hip movement

### Error 2: Hip Escape Without Distance
- **Why It Fails**: Small hip movement doesn't create enough space for knee insertion
- **Correction**: Execute powerful, complete hip escape generating maximum distance
- **Recognition**: Unable to insert knee between bodies after escaping

### Error 3: Premature Knee Insertion
- **Why It Fails**: Attempting knee insertion before creating adequate space allows opponent to pass
- **Correction**: Ensure sufficient hip escape distance before inserting knee barrier
- **Recognition**: Opponent easily slices through or crushes knee shield

### Error 4: Passive Frame Maintenance
- **Why It Fails**: Frames that don't actively push allow opponent to collapse space
- **Correction**: Maintain active pushing pressure with frames throughout escape sequence
- **Recognition**: Opponent gradually closes distance despite your frames

### Error 5: Incomplete Guard Construction
- **Why It Fails**: Stopping at knee shield or half guard when full guard recovery was available
- **Correction**: Continue threading far leg and establishing full closed guard when possible
- **Recognition**: Ending in transitional positions rather than completed guard

## Timing Considerations

- **Optimal Conditions**: When opponent adjusts position, reaches for grips, or shifts weight forward
- **Avoid When**: Opponent has heavy crossface established or has isolated your near arm
- **Setup Sequences**: After defending submission attempts or during opponent's transition attempts
- **Follow-up Windows**: Must complete guard recovery within 5-7 seconds before opponent reestablishes control

## Prerequisites

- **Technical Skills**: Hip escape mechanics, frame creation, guard retention fundamentals
- **Physical Preparation**: Hip mobility, core strength for bridging, shoulder stability for frames
- **Positional Understanding**: Side control defense concepts, guard types and establishment
- **Experience Level**: Beginner-friendly technique, fundamental escape for all levels

## Knowledge Assessment

1. **Mechanical Understanding**: "What creates the space necessary for re-guard to succeed?"
   - A) Upper body strength pushing opponent
   - B) Hip escape combined with frame maintenance
   - C) Rolling to one side
   - D) Waiting for opponent to move
   - **Answer**: B

2. **Timing Recognition**: "When is the optimal moment to initiate re-guard?"
   - A) Immediately when put in side control
   - B) After opponent settles their weight
   - C) During opponent's weight shift or position adjustment
   - D) When fatigued
   - **Answer**: C

3. **Error Prevention**: "What is the most common mistake that causes re-guard attempts to fail?"
   - A) Weak frames or attempting hip escape without established frames
   - B) Moving too slowly
   - C) Using too much energy
   - D) Breathing incorrectly

   - A) Give up and accept side control
   - B) Increase frame strength and angle frames to redirect pressure
   - C) Remove frames completely
   - D) Try a different submission
   - **Answer**: B

## Variants and Adaptations

- **Gi Specific**: Utilize collar and sleeve grips to enhance frame strength and control opponent's posture
- **No-Gi Specific**: Focus on underhooks and overhooks as frames, emphasizing body positioning over grips
- **Self-Defense**: Quick recovery to guard provides defensive options against strikes
- **Competition**: Essential technique for preventing points and recovering offensive position
- **Size Differential**: Smaller practitioners use superior hip mobility; larger practitioners use frame strength

## Training Progressions

1. **Solo Practice**: Hip escape (shrimp) drills without partner to develop motor patterns
2. **Cooperative Drilling**: Partner maintains light side control while you practice frame and escape sequence
3. **Resistant Practice**: Partner provides progressive pressure, increasing difficulty of escape
4. **Sparring Integration**: Implement re-guard during live rolling, recognizing optimal timing windows
5. **Troubleshooting**: Identify why re-guard attempts fail during live training and adjust technique

## Competition Applications

- **IBJJF Rules**: Escaping side control prevents opponent's points, recovering guard enables your attacks
- **No-Gi Competition**: Critical escape for preventing rear mount and enabling guard attacks
- **Self-Defense Context**: Essential for creating space and recovering defensive position against attacks
- **MMA Applications**: Guard recovery enables defensive striking and submission threats

## Historical Context

The re-guard has been fundamental to BJJ since its earliest days, representing the art's emphasis on fighting effectively from bottom positions. The Gracie family's success in vale tudo matches often depended on their ability to recover guard from inferior positions. Modern competition has elevated re-guard from survival technique to strategic position recovery, with elite competitors seamlessly flowing from bottom positions back to offensive guard.

## Safety Considerations

- **Controlled Application**: Maintain awareness of surroundings to avoid collision with other grapplers
- **Mat Awareness**: Ensure adequate space for hip movement
- **Partner Safety**: Avoid kicking or striking partner accidentally during leg movements
- **Gradual Progression**: Build hip escape power gradually to avoid muscle strains

## Position Integration

**Common combinations and sequences:**
- [[Side Control Bottom]] → [[Re-Guard]] → [[Closed Guard Bottom]]
- [[Side Control Bottom]] → [[Re-Guard]] → [[Open Guard Bottom]] (if full guard unavailable)
- [[Side Control Bottom]] → [[Re-Guard]] → [[Half Guard Bottom]] (if knee insertion only)
