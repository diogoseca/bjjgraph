## Transition Description
Toreando Pass, also known as the Bullfighter Pass, is a dynamic offensive technique in Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu (BJJ) used to pass an opponent's guard, transitioning from an Open Guard Top or Standing Guard position to a dominant Side Control or Top Position. This technique involves using footwork and grip control to redirect the opponent's legs to one side, effectively bypassing their guard to achieve a controlling top position. It is particularly effective against open guard players who rely on leg control, embodying the BJJ principle of mobility and leverage to dominate from the top. Toreando Pass is a key strategy in both gi and no-gi grappling, offering a high-percentage method to overcome guard defenses and establish positional dominance with fluid movement.

## Visual Execution Sequence
Detailed description for clear visualization of the transition in action:

Starting from an Open Guard Top or Standing Guard position, you are standing in front of your opponent who is on their back with their legs engaged in an open guard, attempting to control or attack with their feet on your hips or gripping your ankles, as you remain alert for their movements and grip opportunities while maintaining a strong posture with your hands ready to engage their legs or pants in gi or their ankles in no-gi. As you initiate the Toreando Pass, you establish control by gripping their pants at the knees or ankles, or controlling their shins in no-gi, and step to one side with quick footwork to redirect their legs, beginning to move their guard frame out of your path while keeping your posture upright to avoid being off-balanced. You continue to drive their legs to the side with your grips, feeling their resistance as they attempt to re-guard or sweep, using a lateral step to circle around their legs, keeping your hips low and base wide to maintain stability and prevent them from pulling you into their guard. With precise timing, you maintain control of their legs, pushing them further to one side as if waving a bullfighter's cape, sensing their reaction as they either try to hip escape, switch to a different guard, or attack with submissions, while you adjust your angle and speed to complete the pass by stepping fully around their guard. Mid-transition, you keep your weight centered and hands active to prevent their legs from re-engaging, stepping past their hip line to secure the pass, as you position yourself to transition into Side Control by dropping your weight and establishing a crossface and underhook, or settle into a stable Top Position if they manage to partially recover. You complete the Toreando Pass by securing Side Control, pinning their upper body with control, or maintaining a dominant Top Position if the pass lands you higher, having successfully bypassed their guard with agile footwork and redirection. Throughout the movement, you remain aware of their defensive responses like hip escapes, grip breaks, or submission attempts, adjusting your grip tightness, foot positioning, and lateral movement to counter their efforts, demonstrating an effective offensive technique that establishes dominance over their guard.

**Template**: "From Open Guard Top or Standing Guard, standing in front of opponent on back with legs engaged in open guard, attempting control or attack with feet on hips or gripping ankles, alert for movements and grip opportunities, maintain strong posture with hands ready to engage legs or pants in gi or ankles in no-gi. Initiate Toreando Pass by establishing control, grip pants at knees or ankles or control shins in no-gi, step to one side with quick footwork to redirect legs, move guard frame out of path, keep posture upright to avoid off-balance. Drive legs to side with grips, feel resistance as they re-guard or sweep, use lateral step to circle around legs, keep hips low and base wide for stability and prevent guard pull. Maintain control of legs with precise timing, push further to side like waving bullfighter's cape, sense reaction as they hip escape, switch guard, or attack submissions, adjust angle and speed to complete pass by stepping around guard. Keep weight centered and hands active mid-transition to prevent leg re-engagement, step past hip line to secure pass, position for Side Control by dropping weight with crossface and underhook or stable Top Position if they partially recover. Complete Toreando Pass by securing Side Control, pin upper body with control, or maintain dominant Top Position if pass lands higher, bypass guard with agile footwork and redirection. Stay aware of defensive responses like hip escapes, grip breaks, or submission attempts, adjust grip tightness, foot positioning, lateral movement to counter, establish dominance over guard."

## Execution Steps
1. Begin in an Open Guard Top or Standing Guard position, maintaining awareness of the opponent's guard movements and identifying an opportunity to initiate a pass while keeping a strong upright posture.
2. Establish control by gripping their pants at the knees or ankles in gi, or controlling their shins or ankles in no-gi, preparing to redirect their legs to one side.
3. Step to one side with quick footwork to begin moving their guard frame out of your path, using lateral movement to avoid their control points like feet on hips.
4. Drive their legs further to the chosen side with your grips, circling around their legs with a lateral step while keeping your hips low and base wide for stability.
5. Maintain control of their legs, pushing them aside as if waving a bullfighter's cape, adjusting your angle and speed to step fully around their guard while preventing re-engagement.
6. Step past their hip line to secure the pass, keeping your weight centered and hands active to block any attempts to re-guard or sweep.
7. Complete the Toreando Pass by transitioning into Side Control, dropping your weight and establishing a crossface and underhook to pin their upper body, or settling into a stable Top Position if they partially recover.
8. Remain aware of their defensive responses like hip escapes or submission attempts, adapting your grip tightness, foot positioning, and lateral movement to consolidate the pass and maintain dominance.

## Key Details
- **Grip Control**: Essential to grip pants or shins for leg redirection.
- **Footwork Precision**: Quick lateral steps to circle around guard.
- **Posture Maintenance**: Upright stance to avoid being pulled into guard.
- **Leg Redirection**: Push legs to one side to bypass guard frame.
- **Base Stability**: Low hips and wide base for balance during pass.
- **Hip Line Crossing**: Step past hips to secure pass completion.
- **Active Hands**: Prevent leg re-engagement with continuous control.
- **Offensive Awareness**: Monitor for sweeps or submission counters.

## Success Modifiers
Factors that influence the success rate of the transition:
- **Footwork Speed**: Quick lateral movement to outpace guard recovery (+10%)
- **Grip Strength**: Secure control to redirect legs effectively (+8%)
- **Timing Precision**: Initiating pass at optimal moment of guard exposure (+7%)
- **Posture Control**: Maintaining upright stance to resist guard pull (+5%)
- **Experience Level**: Familiarity with dynamic passing mechanics (+5% per skill level)

## Common Counters and Counter-Attacks
Analysis of opponent responses with success rates for counter-attacks:
- **Hip Escape** → [[Guard Recovery]] (Success Rate: 30%, Conditions: opponent shrimps to recover guard during pass)
- **Sweep Attempt** → [[Bottom Position]] (Success Rate: 25%, Conditions: opponent uses leg control for sweep during lateral movement)
- **Submission Counter** → [[Triangle Control]] (Success Rate: 20%, Conditions: opponent catches leg or neck during pass attempt)
- **Grip Break** → [[Open Guard Bottom]] (Success Rate: 15%, Conditions: opponent breaks leg control to re-establish guard)
- **Leg Lock Attempt** → [[Kneebar Control]] (Success Rate: 10%, Conditions: opponent attacks exposed leg during pass)

## Decision Logic for Transition
```
If [opponent's guard] is open with legs exposed for control:
- Initiate [[Toreando Pass]] to bypass guard (Probability: 65%)

Else if [scramble situation] offers passing opportunity with space:
- Execute [[Toreando Pass]] for dominant position (Probability: 60%)

Else if [personal strategy] favors dynamic passing over pressure:
- Attempt [[Toreando Pass]] to outmaneuver guard (Probability: 55%)

Else if [opponent counters] with strong hip escape or grip break mid-pass:
- Adjust to [[Knee Cut Pass]] for alternative pass (Probability: 40%)

Else if [pass fails] due to successful sweep or submission threat:
- Transition to [[Defensive Position]] to mitigate (Probability: 30%)
```

## Variants
- **Standard Toreando Pass**: Classic pass with direct leg redirection to one side.
- **Feint Toreando Pass**: Using a fake step to one side to bait reaction before passing opposite.
- **Dynamic Toreando Pass**: Incorporating multiple directional steps to confuse guard player.
- **Counter Toreando Pass**: Baiting guard engagement to open passing lane for redirection.
- **Double Toreando Pass**: Controlling both legs simultaneously for maximum redirection.
- **Toreando to Submission**: Transitioning directly to a submission setup after passing.
- **Combination Pass**: Chaining with other passes like Knee Cut if initial Toreando fails.
- **No-Gi Toreando Pass**: Adapted for no-gi with shin or ankle control instead of pants grips.

## Tactical Applications
- **Guard Passing**: Primary use to bypass open guard configurations.
- **Offensive Strategy**: Establishes top control for attack potential.
- **Counter-Attack Setup**: Sets up submissions or further passes after control.
- **Energy Management**: Moderate energy cost balanced by strategic outcome.
