## Transition Description
The Toreando Pass (also known as the "Bullfighter Pass" or "Matador Pass") is a dynamic guard passing technique where the passer controls the opponent's legs, typically at the knees or ankles, and redirects them to the side while circling around to establish side control. Drawing its name from bullfighting movements, the pass relies on speed, direction changes, and proper gripping to bypass the opponent's defensive frames. This technique is particularly effective against open guard variations and has become a fundamental passing method in both gi and no-gi contexts due to its versatility and efficiency against a wide range of guard configurations.

## Execution Steps
1. From standing position, establish grips on opponent's legs (pants at knees in gi, direct control in no-gi)
2. Create pressure by driving forward to elicit defensive reaction
3. Redirect opponent's legs to one side with explosive movement
4. Circle around to the opposite side while maintaining leg control
5. Prevent opponent's hip mobility through proper timing and pressure
6. Keep chest pressure during the transition to limit re-guarding attempts
7. Establish side control with proper weight distribution
8. Secure upper body control to prevent defensive counters

## Key Grips/Controls
- Pants/knee control in gi (double pants grip)
- Direct knee/shin control in no-gi
- Sleeve or collar control to limit upper body mobility (gi)
- Wrist or bicep control for upper body limitation (no-gi)
- Shoulder pressure during completion phase
- Hip control during final stage of pass
- Chest connection to prevent space creation

## Common Counters
- [[Leg Elevation]] → [[Shin Shield]]
- [[Inversion Defense]] → [[Inverted Guard]]
- [[Shin-to-Shin Entry]] → [[Shin-to-Shin Guard]]
- [[Lasso Guard Entry]] → [[Lasso Guard]]
- [[Collar Drag]] → [[Sweep Sequence]]

## Variants
- Classical Toreando (direct side control finish)
- Modified Toreando with knee-on-belly transition
- Double-under grip variation
- Single-side control variation
- No-gi specific hand positioning
- Floating Toreando with temporary weightlessness
- Reactive Toreando as defensive counter
- Pressure variation with added upper body control

## Expert Insights
- **Danaher System**: Emphasizes the Toreando as a core component of a systematic approach to passing, focusing on precision in grip placement and timing rather than pure speed. Creates clear mechanical principles for controlling the opponent's defensive frames throughout the pass, with particular focus on preventing the recovery of guard through methodical pressure application during the circling phase.
- **Gordon Ryan**: Utilizes the Toreando as part of an integrated passing system, often employing it as a primary option against seated and butterfly guard variations. Emphasizes creating dilemmas for the guard player through grip configurations that limit defensive options while maintaining the ability to transition to alternate passes if resistance is encountered.
- **Eddie Bravo**: Has adapted the traditional Toreando concepts for no-gi specific scenarios, focusing on controlling the legs through hooks and direct pressure rather than cloth grips. Emphasizes the importance of hip movement and angle creation during the pass, particularly when facing 10th Planet-specific guard configurations.

## Timing Considerations
- Execute when opponent's legs are extended
- Time with opponent's attempt to establish specific guards
- Perform after breaking opponent's grips
- Implement when opponent shifts weight to one side
- Use as counter to specific guard recovery attempts

## Follow-up Options
- [[Side Control Consolidation]] → [[Side Control]]
- [[Transition to Mount]] → [[Mount]]
- [[Knee on Belly]] → [[Knee on Belly Position]]
- [[Kimura Trap]] → [[Kimura Control]]
- [[North-South Transition]] → [[North-South]]
- [[Far Side Armbar]] → [[Armbar Control]]

## Common Errors
- Insufficient leg control → Re-guarding opportunity
- Poor pressure maintenance → Space creation
- Improper circling angle → Inefficient pathway
- Neglecting upper body control → Defensive framing
- Premature release of grips → Guard recovery

## Computer Science Analogy
The Toreando Pass functions as an "efficient path algorithm" in the BJJ state graph that optimizes the trajectory from the open guard state to the side control state. It implements a form of "constraint manipulation" by redirecting the opponent's most powerful defensive resources (their legs) away from their effective range, creating a temporary state where defensive options are minimized. The technique exemplifies the concept of "asynchronous state transitions" where one subsystem (leg position) is manipulated first, creating favorable conditions for the subsequent transition of another subsystem (upper body position) to complete the state change.
