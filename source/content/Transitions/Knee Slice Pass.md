# Knee Slice Pass
#bjj #transition #guard_passing #half_guard #fundamental

## Visual Execution Sequence

From half guard top position, you establish strong underhook control and crossface pressure while your opponent's legs control your trapped leg. You drive your knee forward and across your opponent's bottom leg, creating a slicing motion that cuts through their guard structure. Simultaneously, you drive your shoulder into their face with crossface pressure while controlling their far arm or hip. As your knee clears their bottom leg, you slide your trapped leg free while maintaining heavy shoulder pressure, transitioning smoothly into side control with dominant position secured.

**One-Sentence Summary**: "From half guard top, you slice your knee across opponent's bottom leg while maintaining crossface pressure, clearing their guard to establish side control."

## Execution Steps

1. **Setup Requirements**: Establish underhook with inside arm, create strong crossface pressure with head/shoulder, control opponent's far arm or hip with free hand

2. **Initial Movement**: Drive weight forward onto opponent's chest, begin directing knee forward and across their bottom leg in slicing motion

3. **Opponent Response**: Opponent attempts to maintain half guard by gripping trapped leg, creates frames to prevent crossface, works to recover full guard

4. **Adaptation**: Adjust knee angle and pressure based on opponent's leg position; increase crossface pressure if opponent frames; shift hip positioning to prevent guard recovery

5. **Completion**: Drive knee fully across bottom leg while extracting trapped leg; settle hips to mat as knee clears; establish side control chest-to-chest position

6. **Consolidation**: Secure crossface control, establish hip pressure, control near arm with underhook, prevent opponent's escape attempts

## Key Technical Details

- **Grip Requirements**: Underhook with inside arm (deep and tight), crossface with head/shoulder pressure, far arm controlling opponent's arm or hip
- **Base/Foundation**: Weight distributed forward onto opponent; inside knee driving across as fulcrum; outside leg providing base and driving power
- **Timing Windows**: Execute as opponent's frames weaken or when creating sweep attempt; optimal timing when opponent's legs momentarily relax
- **Leverage Points**: Knee acts as wedge separating guard; crossface creates immobilizing pressure; underhook prevents opponent from turning away
- **Common Adjustments**: If knee gets stuck, adjust angle more acute or change direction slightly; if opponent frames effectively, increase crossface pressure before continuing slice

## Common Counters

Opponent defensive responses with success rates and conditions:

- **[[Underhook Counter]]** → [[Half Guard Retention]] (Success Rate: 50%, Conditions: Opponent establishes deep underhook before pass initiates)
- **[[Knee Shield Recovery]]** → [[Half Guard Retention]] (Success Rate: 45%, Conditions: Opponent creates knee shield frame before knee slice completes)
- **[[Hip Escape]]** → [[Full Guard Recovery]] (Success Rate: 35%, Conditions: Opponent escapes hips away from crossface pressure)
- **[[Lockdown]]** → [[Half Guard Retention]] (Success Rate: 40%, Conditions: Opponent locks feet together preventing leg extraction)

### Decision Logic for AI Opponent

```
If [underhook not established]:
- Execute [[Underhook Counter]] (Probability: 50%)
- Establish deep underhook to prevent forward pressure

Else if [knee slice starting]:
- Execute [[Knee Shield Recovery]] (Probability: 45%)
- Create knee shield frame to block slicing motion

Else if [crossface pressure weak]:
- Execute [[Hip Escape]] (Probability: 35%)
- Escape hips and recover guard

Else [pass progressing]:
- Execute [[Lockdown]] (Probability: 40%)
- Lock feet to prevent leg extraction
```

## Expert Insights

### John Danaher
"The knee slice pass is fundamentally about creating an insurmountable structural problem for your opponent - you're driving a wedge between their legs while simultaneously controlling their upper body with the crossface. The genius of this pass is that it attacks the guard at its weakest point - the space between the legs - while preventing the primary defensive responses through upper body control. The key technical detail is understanding that the knee must move in a precise arc, not just forward but slightly upward and across, creating a cutting motion that makes it nearly impossible for the opponent to keep their legs together. The crossface is not optional - it's the control mechanism that prevents them from turning into you or creating frames."

### Gordon Ryan
"This is my highest-percentage pass from half guard because it's so reliable when you understand the pressure points. The crossface is everything - if you can make them carry your shoulder weight on their face, they can't create effective frames. I've passed world champions with this because once the knee starts slicing through and they're dealing with heavy shoulder pressure, they have no good options. The timing I look for is when they're trying to recover full guard or attempting a sweep - that's when their legs open slightly and I drive the knee through. In competition, I probably complete this pass 80% of the time when I can establish the proper crossface. The detail everyone misses is that your hips need to be heavy and low as the knee slices - you're not just moving the knee, you're driving your entire body through."

### Eddie Bravo
"From the 10th Planet perspective, we see the knee slice as one of the fundamental threats that forces the bottom player into defensive mode. What I teach is recognizing when the knee slice is coming and having multiple contingency plans - the lockdown, the electric chair setup, the underhook battle. But when I'm on top and using the knee slice, I'm thinking about creating a systematic attack where the pass is just one option. If they defend the knee slice hard, I have the back take. If they try to underhook, I have the darce or anaconda. The pass itself is high percentage, but it's even more valuable as part of a system that creates multiple simultaneous threats they can't all defend."

## Common Errors

### Error 1: Attempting pass without establishing crossface pressure
- **Why It Fails**: Opponent can create effective frames and prevent forward pressure; guard retention becomes much easier
- **Correction**: Always establish strong crossface before initiating knee slice; head/shoulder must be driving into their face
- **Recognition**: Opponent easily creating frames and blocking passing attempt; no forward pressure established

### Error 2: Driving knee straight forward instead of slicing across
- **Why It Fails**: Straight forward motion allows opponent to keep legs together; slicing motion is what separates the guard
- **Correction**: Drive knee forward and across in arc motion, cutting through the space between legs
- **Recognition**: Knee getting stuck or stalled by opponent's legs staying together

### Error 3: Lifting hips too high during pass
- **Why It Fails**: High hips reduce pressure and allow opponent to hip escape or recover guard
- **Correction**: Keep hips low and heavy throughout pass; weight should be driving down onto opponent
- **Recognition**: Opponent easily escaping hips away; feeling light on top; opponent recovering guard

### Error 4: Failing to control far arm or hip
- **Why It Fails**: Opponent can use far arm to create frames or assist in guard recovery
- **Correction**: Control far arm with free hand or post on hip to prevent movement
- **Recognition**: Opponent creating effective frames with far arm; blocking pass progression

### Error 5: Not following hip position as knee slices
- **Why It Fails**: Knee may clear but hips remain in half guard position, allowing re-guard
- **Correction**: As knee slices through, immediately shift hips to side control position
- **Recognition**: Knee clears but opponent can still recover guard; positional transition incomplete

## Timing Considerations

- **Optimal Conditions**: Opponent attempting sweep or guard recovery (legs momentarily open); strong crossface established; opponent's frames weakened
- **Avoid When**: Opponent has deep underhook on you; knee shield actively framing; you lack crossface control; opponent has lockdown established
- **Setup Sequences**: After opponent fails sweep attempt; when transitioning from other passing attempts; after establishing underhook and crossface dominance
- **Follow-up Windows**: Must establish side control immediately (within 1-2 seconds) after knee clears to prevent guard recovery

## Prerequisites

- **Technical Skills**: Basic half guard top control; crossface pressure fundamentals; underhook control; positional weight distribution
- **Physical Preparation**: Hip mobility for knee slicing motion; shoulder/neck strength for maintaining crossface; core strength for pressure maintenance
- **Positional Understanding**: Half guard mechanics; side control establishment; guard passing principles; angle creation
- **Experience Level**: Beginner-Intermediate - fundamental passing technique teachable at early stages with refinement over time

## Knowledge Assessment

1. **Mechanical Understanding**: "What creates the passing force in the knee slice pass?"
   - A) Only the knee movement
   - B) Only the crossface pressure
   - C) The combination of knee slicing motion, crossface pressure, and underhook control
   - D) Opponent's cooperation
   - **Answer**: C

2. **Timing Recognition**: "When is the optimal moment to initiate the knee slice?"
   - A) When opponent has deep underhook
   - B) When opponent's legs are locked tight
   - C) When opponent's guard opens slightly (sweep attempt, guard recovery) and crossface is established
   - D) At any random time
   - **Answer**: C

3. **Error Prevention**: "What is the most critical error in knee slice execution?"
   - A) Slicing knee too fast
   - B) Attempting pass without establishing crossface pressure first
   - C) Using underhook control
   - D) Driving weight forward
   - **Answer**: B

4. **Setup Requirements**: "What must be established before attempting knee slice pass?"
   - A) Only underhook control
   - B) Strong crossface pressure, underhook control, and far arm/hip control
   - C) Both legs must be free
   - D) Opponent must be tired
   - **Answer**: B

5. **Adaptation**: "How do you adjust if opponent creates knee shield during pass?"
   - A) Force knee through harder
   - B) Give up immediately
   - C) Increase crossface pressure, adjust knee angle, or transition to different pass
   - D) Pull back completely
   - **Answer**: C

## Variants and Adaptations

- **Gi Specific**: Can use gi grips for crossface (collar grip) and far arm control (sleeve grip); pants grip for hip control
- **No-Gi Specific**: Crossface with shoulder pressure and head position; underhook and whizzer positions more critical without gi grips
- **Self-Defense**: Highly effective for establishing control and moving to dominant position in street scenario
- **Competition**: Fundamental passing technique effective at all skill levels; high-percentage in gi and no-gi competition
- **Size Differential**: Larger practitioners can use weight advantage for crossface pressure; smaller practitioners rely more on timing and angle precision

## Training Progressions

1. **Solo Practice**: Practice knee slicing motion and hip positioning without partner to develop movement pattern
2. **Cooperative Drilling**: Partner allows pass with minimal resistance to develop feel for proper angles and pressure points
3. **Resistant Practice**: Partner provides progressive defensive resistance requiring timing refinement and pressure adjustment
4. **Sparring Integration**: Implement pass during live rolling from half guard top position
5. **Troubleshooting**: Analyze failed passing attempts - usually crossface pressure, knee angle, or timing issues requiring correction

## Competition Applications

- **IBJJF Rules**: Fundamental passing technique scoring 3 points for guard pass to side control; legal at all belt levels
- **No-Gi Competition**: Highly effective without gi; requires strong pressure and positioning over grip control
- **Self-Defense Context**: Excellent for establishing control and advancing position in street scenario
- **MMA Applications**: Effective in MMA with consideration for striking defense; crossface provides control while advancing position

## Historical Context

The knee slice pass has become one of the most fundamental and widely taught guard passes in modern Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu. Its effectiveness across gi and no-gi contexts, combined with its mechanical reliability, has made it a staple technique taught from white belt through black belt. The pass exemplifies efficient guard passing principles: controlling the upper body while creating space to clear the legs.

## Safety Considerations

- **Controlled Application**: Apply crossface pressure progressively; avoid sudden or excessive neck pressure
- **Mat Awareness**: Ensure adequate space for passing movement without obstacles
- **Partner Safety**: Be mindful of crossface pressure on partner's neck/face; communicate during drilling
- **Gradual Progression**: Build up speed and pressure gradually during learning phase

## Position Integration

**Common combinations and sequences:**
- [[Half Guard Top]] → [[Knee Slice Pass]] → [[Side Control Top]]
- [[Half Guard Top]] → [[Knee Slice Pass]] → [[Failed Pass]] → [[Different Passing Attempt]]
