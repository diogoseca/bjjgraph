## Transition Description
Stack Defense is a critical defensive technique in Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu (BJJ) used to counter an opponent's stacking guard pass attempt, transitioning from a Closed Guard Bottom or Open Guard Bottom position to a Guard Recovery or Neutral Position. This technique involves breaking the opponent's posture and creating space to prevent them from stacking your legs over your head, effectively neutralizing their pass and maintaining or recovering your guard. It is particularly effective against aggressive top players attempting to control and pass by stacking, embodying the BJJ principle of posture control and space management to defend against dominant positioning. Stack Defense is a key strategy in both gi and no-gi grappling, offering a high-percentage method to retain guard integrity and potentially regain a more advantageous position.

## Visual Execution Sequence
Detailed description for clear visualization of the transition in action:

Starting from a Closed Guard Bottom or Open Guard Bottom position, you are on your back with your legs engaged around the opponent who is on top, attempting a stacking pass by driving forward, lifting your hips, and trying to stack your legs over your head to control and pass your guard, as you remain alert for their posture and weight distribution while maintaining a strong grip on their collar or sleeves in gi or wrists in no-gi. As the opponent initiates the stack by driving their weight forward and lifting your hips, you react instantly by recognizing the pass attempt, beginning the Stack Defense by breaking their posture with a strong pull on their collar or wrists, simultaneously opening your guard if closed to gain mobility, ensuring your elbows are tight to prevent them from posturing up fully. You push with your legs against their hips or thighs to create space, using your core to pull your hips back down to the mat, feeling their stacking pressure lessen as they struggle to maintain control over your elevated legs, with your shoulders and head pressing into the mat for leverage. With precise timing, you keep one hand controlling their head or neck to maintain the posture break, using your other hand to frame against their shoulder or bicep to block their advance, sensing their reaction as they either persist with the stack or switch to a different passing angle. Mid-transition, you maintain active hip movement to prevent them from re-establishing the stack, keeping your legs ready to re-guard or push off further, as you position yourself to either recover a full Guard Recovery by re-wrapping your legs around them or transition to a Neutral Position by creating enough space to stand or disengage. You complete the Stack Defense by either successfully pulling them back into your guard, locking your legs around their torso or hips for Guard Recovery, or by pushing them away to reset to a Neutral Position, having successfully defended the stacking pass. Throughout the movement, you remain aware of their attempts to chain passes, adjust grips, or counter with submissions, adjusting your grip strength, framing, and hip movement to counter their responses, demonstrating an effective defensive technique that maintains your guard or shifts the fight to a safer position.

**Template**: "From Closed Guard Bottom or Open Guard Bottom, on your back with legs engaged around opponent on top, attempting stacking pass by driving forward, lifting hips, stacking legs over head to control and pass guard, alert for posture and weight distribution, maintaining strong grip on collar or sleeves in gi or wrists in no-gi. React to stack initiation as opponent drives weight forward and lifts hips, begin Stack Defense by breaking posture with strong pull on collar or wrists, open guard if closed for mobility, keep elbows tight to prevent full posture. Push with legs against hips or thighs for space, use core to pull hips back to mat, lessen stacking pressure as they struggle to control elevated legs, shoulders and head press into mat for leverage. Keep one hand controlling head or neck for posture break, frame with other hand against shoulder or bicep to block advance, sense reaction as they persist or switch passing angle. Maintain active hip movement mid-transition to prevent re-stack, keep legs ready to re-guard or push off, position for Guard Recovery by re-wrapping legs or Neutral Position by creating space to stand or disengage. Complete Stack Defense by pulling back into guard, locking legs around torso or hips for Guard Recovery, or pushing away to reset to Neutral Position, defend stacking pass successfully. Stay aware of chained passes, grip adjustments, or submission counters, adjust grip strength, framing, hip movement to counter, maintain guard or shift to safer position."

## Execution Steps
1. Begin in a Closed Guard Bottom or Open Guard Bottom position, maintaining awareness of the opponent's movements and recognizing the initiation of a stacking pass when they drive forward and lift your hips.
2. React instantly by breaking their posture with a strong pull on their collar or wrists, opening your guard if closed to gain mobility and keeping your elbows tight to prevent them from posturing up.
3. Push with your legs against their hips or thighs to create space, using your core to pull your hips back down to the mat to reduce their stacking pressure.
4. Keep one hand controlling their head or neck to maintain the posture break, using your other hand to frame against their shoulder or bicep to block their advance.
5. Maintain active hip movement during the transition to prevent them from re-establishing the stack, keeping your legs ready to re-guard or push off further.
6. Complete the Stack Defense by either pulling them back into your guard, locking your legs around their torso or hips for Guard Recovery, or pushing them away to reset to a Neutral Position.
7. Ensure control over their posture and your base to prevent follow-up passes, preparing to continue the fight from a recovered guard or neutral stance.
8. Remain aware of their offensive responses like chaining passes or adjusting grips, adapting your grip strength, framing, and hip movement to counter and consolidate the defense.

- **Stack Persistence** → [[Top Position]] (Success Rate: 25%, Conditions: opponent maintains stack and forces legs over head)
- **Posture Recovery** → [[Open Guard Top]] (Success Rate: 20%, Conditions: opponent breaks posture control and stands back up)
- **Submission Attempt** → [[Can Opener]] (Success Rate: 15%, Conditions: opponent capitalizes on stacked position for submission)
- **Control Counter** → [[Knee Cut Position]] (Success Rate: 10%, Conditions: opponent uses your defensive movement for alternative pass)

## Decision Logic for Transition
```
If [opponent initiates stacking pass] with forward drive and hip lift:
- Initiate [[Stack Defense]] to counter and retain guard (Probability: 70%)

Else if [scramble situation] involves potential stacking threat:
- Execute [[Stack Defense]] for guard retention (Probability: 65%)

Else if [personal strategy] favors guard defense over submission risk:
- Attempt [[Stack Defense]] to maintain position (Probability: 60%)

Else if [opponent adjusts] with angle change or persistent stack mid-defense:
- Adjust to [[Hip Escape]] for alternative defense (Probability: 50%)

Else if [defense fails] due to successful pass or submission threat:
- Transition to [[Turtle Position]] to mitigate (Probability: 40%)
