## Transition Description
The Smash Pass is a powerful offensive technique in Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu (BJJ) used to transition from Open Guard Top or Standing Guard to a dominant position such as Side Control or Top Position. This technique involves using heavy pressure and body weight to "smash" through the opponent's guard, collapsing their legs and bypassing their defenses to establish control on the other side. It is particularly effective against opponents playing open or dynamic guards, embodying the BJJ principle of using pressure and control to neutralize bottom game attacks. The Smash Pass is a key strategy in both gi and no-gi grappling, offering a high-percentage method to pass the guard and secure a dominant top position.

## Visual Execution Sequence
Detailed description for clear visualization of the transition in action:

Starting from Open Guard Top or Standing Guard, you face your opponent who is on their back or seated, engaged in grip fighting with sleeve and collar grips in gi or wrist and elbow control in no-gi, as you assess their guard for an opportunity to pass or defend against sweeps and submissions. To initiate the Smash Pass, you first establish control by securing grips on their pants at the knees or ankles with both hands to manage their leg movement, stepping forward to close the distance if standing, or dropping your hips low if already on your knees, ensuring a strong base to apply pressure and avoid being off-balanced. You then drive forward with your hips, pushing their legs to one side, typically to your right, using your left shoulder and chest to apply heavy pressure on their right thigh or knee, collapsing their guard structure, feeling their legs compress as they struggle to maintain space or frame against you. With sustained pressure, you keep your head low and tight to their hip or torso to avoid submission threats like triangles, driving your weight through your shoulder to pin their right leg to the mat while stepping your left leg wide to block their hip escape, sensing their balance shift as they attempt to shrimp or recover guard. Mid-transition, you maintain your grip on their pants to prevent them from re-establishing guard, keeping your hips heavy and low to crush any framing attempts, as you slide your right knee through the space created between their legs, ensuring they cannot easily sweep or pull you back into guard. You complete the pass by clearing their legs entirely, settling into Side Control with your chest on their torso and your arms securing an underhook and crossface, or stabilizing in a Top Position if they manage to turn away, having successfully bypassed their guard with dominant pressure. Throughout the movement, you remain aware of their attempts to frame, shrimp, or counter with submissions, adjusting your pressure, head position, and grip strength to counter their defenses, demonstrating an effective offensive guard passing technique that shifts the fight to a controlling top position.

**Template**: "From Open Guard Top or Standing Guard, facing opponent on back or seated, grip fighting with sleeve and collar grips in gi or wrist and elbow control in no-gi, assessing guard for pass or defense against sweeps and submissions. Establish control, grip pants at knees or ankles with both hands for leg movement, step forward to close distance if standing, or drop hips low if on knees, ensure strong base for pressure. Drive forward with hips, push legs to one side (right), use left shoulder and chest for heavy pressure on right thigh or knee, collapse guard structure, compress their legs as they struggle for space or frame. Keep head low and tight to hip or torso to avoid submissions, drive weight through shoulder to pin right leg to mat, step left leg wide to block hip escape, shift their balance as they shrimp or recover. Maintain pants grip mid-transition to prevent guard re-establishment, keep hips heavy and low to crush framing, slide right knee through space between legs, prevent sweep or guard pull. Complete pass by clearing legs, settle into Side Control with chest on torso, arms in underhook and crossface, or stabilize in Top Position if they turn, bypass guard with dominant pressure. Stay aware of framing, shrimping, or submission attempts, adjust pressure, head position, grip strength to counter, shift fight to controlling top position."

## Execution Steps
1. Begin in Open Guard Top or Standing Guard, recognizing the opportunity to pass when the opponent's guard is open or dynamic, exposing potential space to apply pressure.
2. Establish control by securing grips on their pants at the knees or ankles with both hands to manage their leg movement, stepping forward to close the distance if standing, or dropping your hips low if already on your knees to prepare for the pass.
3. Drive forward with your hips, pushing their legs to one side, using your shoulder and chest to apply heavy pressure on their thigh or knee, collapsing their guard structure.
4. Keep your head low and tight to their hip or torso to avoid submission threats, driving your weight through your shoulder to pin their leg to the mat while stepping one leg wide to block their hip escape.
5. Maintain your grip on their pants during the transition to prevent them from re-establishing guard, keeping your hips heavy and low to crush any framing attempts, as you slide your knee through the space created between their legs.
6. Complete the pass by clearing their legs entirely, ensuring you bypass their guard defenses to settle into Side Control with control over their torso.
7. Secure the position with an underhook and crossface in Side Control, or stabilize in a Top Position if they turn away, maintaining control to prevent recovery.
8. Remain aware of their defensive attempts like framing, shrimping, or countering with submissions, adjusting your pressure, head position, and grip strength to counter and consolidate the pass.

## Key Details
- **Hip Pressure**: Essential to apply heavy pressure through hips to collapse guard.
- **Leg Control Grips**: Secure pants at knees or ankles to manage leg movement.
- **Shoulder Drive**: Use shoulder and chest to pin opponent's leg or thigh.
- **Head Positioning**: Keep head low and tight to avoid submission threats.
- **Wide Base**: Step one leg wide to block hip escape and maintain balance.
- **Knee Slide**: Slide knee through space to clear legs during pass.
- **Sustained Weight**: Keep hips heavy to crush framing or recovery attempts.
- **Defensive Awareness**: Monitor for sweeps, submissions, or guard recovery.

## Success Modifiers
Factors that influence the success rate of the transition:
- **Pressure Application**: Heavy hip and shoulder pressure to collapse guard (+10%)
- **Timing Precision**: Executing during opponent's guard adjustment or vulnerability (+8%)
- **Grip Strength on Legs**: Secure control of legs to prevent recovery (+7%)

- **Experience Level**: Familiarity with pressure passing mechanics and counters (+5% per skill level)

## Common Counters and Counter-Attacks
Analysis of opponent responses with success rates for counter-attacks:
- **Hip Escape** → [[Open Guard Bottom]] (Success Rate: 35%, Conditions: opponent shrimps to create space and recover guard)
- **Frame Defense** → [[Guard Retention]] (Success Rate: 30%, Conditions: opponent establishes strong frames to block pressure)
- **Submission Attempt** → [[Triangle Choke Side]] (Success Rate: 25%, Conditions: opponent catches your head or arm during pass attempt)
- **Sweep Counter** → [[Bottom Position]] (Success Rate: 20%, Conditions: opponent uses your forward pressure for a sweep)
- **Leg Lock Threat** → [[Leg Lock Attempt]] (Success Rate: 15%, Conditions: opponent counters with a leg attack as legs are exposed)

## Decision Logic for Transition
```
If [opponent guard] is open or dynamic with exposed space:
- Initiate [[Smash Pass]] to collapse and pass (Probability: 70%)

Else if [scramble situation] offers passing opportunity:
- Execute [[Smash Pass]] for control (Probability: 65%)

Else if [personal strategy] favors pressure passing:
- Attempt [[Smash Pass]] to dominate (Probability: 60%)

Else if [opponent frames] or resists with strong defense mid-pass:
- Adjust to [[Knee Cut Pass]] for alternative (Probability: 50%)

Else if [pass fails] due to sweep or submission threat:
- Transition to [[Guard Recovery]] to mitigate (Probability: 40%)
```
