# Bodylock Pass

## Visual Execution Sequence

From open guard top, you secure a bodylock around opponent's torso by lacing both arms around their body and clasping hands behind their back. You lift their hips slightly off the mat while driving forward pressure, forcing their legs to lose their framing structure. As you walk your body around toward side control, your bodylock maintains control while you clear their legs systematically. The combination of lift, forward pressure, and lateral movement allows you to pass their guard while keeping them tightly controlled in the bodylock.

**One-Sentence Summary**: "Securing bodylock around opponent's torso, you lift hips off mat and walk laterally to pass guard while maintaining tight control."

## Execution Steps

1. **Setup Requirements**: Establish open guard top; secure bodylock grip around torso; establish strong posture
2. **Initial Movement**: Lift opponent's hips slightly; drive forward pressure; begin walking laterally
3. **Opponent Response**: Opponent attempts to keep hips heavy, create frames, or hook your legs
4. **Adaptation**: Maintain tight bodylock; adjust lifting and pressure; continue lateral movement
5. **Completion**: Clear opponent's legs completely; drive to side control; maintain bodylock initially
6. **Consolidation**: Release bodylock; establish standard side control grips; settle weight

## Key Technical Details

- **Grip Requirements**: Bodylock with hands clasped behind opponent's back; tight connection throughout
- **Base/Foundation**: Wide base with legs; ability to generate lift while maintaining stability
- **Timing Windows**: Execute when opponent's guard is open; during their adjustment or transition
- **Leverage Points**: Bodylock lift removes their hip connection to mat; forward pressure collapses guard structure
- **Common Adjustments**: Vary direction of lateral walk; adjust lift amount based on opponent's weight

## Expert Insights

### John Danaher
"The bodylock pass is fundamentally about removing the opponent's ability to use their hips effectively. By lifting them even slightly off the mat and maintaining that lift, you eliminate their hip mobility which is essential for guard retention. The pass then becomes a matter of walking around a controlled, relatively immobile opponent. It requires strength but also proper mechanics - lifting from your legs, not your back."

### Gordon Ryan
"I use bodylock passes constantly, especially against opponents who have good guard retention. Once I have that bodylock secured, I know I can pass - it's just a matter of time and patience. They can't frame effectively because I control their entire torso. The key is accepting that it might take 20-30 seconds of work, but if the bodylock is tight, the pass is inevitable."

### Eddie Bravo
"Bodylock passes are huge in no-gi because you don't have gi grips to rely on. That bodylock gives you incredible control - they're basically stuck to you and can't create the distance they need. I teach variations where you can switch between different passing angles while maintaining the bodylock. It's exhausting to hold, so you need to be efficient with your movement, but it's one of the most secure passing control grips you can get."

## Common Errors

### Error 1: Loose Bodylock
- **Why It Fails**: Slack in bodylock allows opponent to create frames and defend effectively
- **Correction**: Maintain tight squeeze throughout; clasped hands should be in lower back area
- **Recognition**: Opponent creates space; bodylock feels disconnected

### Error 2: Lifting Without Forward Pressure
- **Why It Fails**: Lift alone doesn't pass guard; must combine with forward drive
- **Correction**: Lift hips while simultaneously driving chest forward
- **Recognition**: Lifting opponent but not advancing position

### Error 3: Static Position Without Walking
- **Why It Fails**: Holding bodylock without lateral movement allows opponent to defend indefinitely
- **Correction**: Constantly walk laterally around opponent; change angles systematically
- **Recognition**: Stuck in same position despite having bodylock

## Timing Considerations

- **Optimal Conditions**: When opponent's guard is open; after tiring them with pressure
- **Avoid When**: Opponent has strong frames already established; you're fatigued
- **Setup Sequences**: After opening closed guard; following other passing attempts
- **Follow-up Windows**: Must complete pass within 30-45 seconds before fatigue reduces effectiveness

## Prerequisites

- **Technical Skills**: Understanding of pressure passing; lifting mechanics; lateral movement
- **Physical Preparation**: Back and leg strength for lifting; grip strength; cardiovascular endurance
- **Positional Understanding**: Guard passing principles; bodylock control concepts
- **Experience Level**: Intermediate; requires strength and technical understanding

## Knowledge Assessment

1. **Mechanical Understanding**: "What does the bodylock accomplish in this pass?"
   - A) Nothing important
   - B) Removes opponent's hip mobility by lifting and controlling torso
   - C) Only provides grip
   - D) Makes you tired
   - **Answer**: B

2. **Timing Recognition**: "When is the optimal time to secure the bodylock?"
   - A) When opponent has closed guard
   - B) When opponent's guard is open and accessible
   - C) Never
   - D) When you're in side control
   - **Answer**: B

3. **Error Prevention**: "What is the most common mistake with bodylock passes?"
   - A) Maintaining bodylock too tight
   - B) Walking laterally too much
   - C) Holding static position without lateral movement
   - D) Lifting too much
   - **Answer**: C

4. **Setup Requirements**: "What must be combined with the lift for effective passing?"
   - A) Nothing else needed
   - B) Forward pressure and lateral walking movement
   - C) Sitting back
   - D) Standing upright
   - **Answer**: B

5. **Adaptation**: "If opponent hooks your leg during bodylock pass, what should you do?"
   - A) Give up immediately
   - B) Release bodylock
   - C) Clear hook while maintaining bodylock, continue walking laterally
   - D) Fall backward
   - **Answer**: C

## Variants and Adaptations

- **Gi Specific**: Can combine bodylock with gi grips for additional control
- **No-Gi Specific**: Primary bodylock passing context; essential no-gi technique
- **Self-Defense**: Maintains control while advancing position
- **Competition**: High-control passing for conservative approach; can be tiring
- **Size Differential**: Larger practitioners have advantage; smaller rely more on technical walking

## Training Progressions

1. **Solo Practice**: Practice bodylock grip mechanics and walking patterns
2. **Cooperative Drilling**: Partner allows pass to learn timing and movement
3. **Resistant Practice**: Partner provides realistic defense
4. **Sparring Integration**: Use bodylock passes in live rolling
5. **Troubleshooting**: Identify why passes fail against different defenses
