- **Execution Complexity**: Medium
- **Physical Attributes**: Hip mobility (Medium), Upper body control (Medium)

## Transition Description
The Leg Drag Pass is a modern, dynamic guard passing technique where the passer drags the opponent's leg across their body while establishing upper body control. This creates a position where the opponent's hips are turned away and their guard is compromised, allowing the passer to advance to a dominant position. The leg drag has become a fundamental passing technique in contemporary BJJ due to its versatility against various guard types and its ability to lead to either side control or back control, making it one of the most efficient passing systems in the art.

## Execution Steps
1. From a standing or combat base position, control one of opponent's legs
2. Establish grip control on opponent's collar, sleeve, or upper body
3. Drag opponent's leg across your body, typically across the thigh
4. Control opponent's hip to prevent defensive movement
5. Apply pressure to keep opponent's hips facing away
6. Maintain control of opponent's upper body throughout the movement
7. Step through to establish side control or transition to back
8. Consolidate position with proper grips and pressure

## Key Grips/Controls
- Control of opponent's pant leg or ankle
- Collar or sleeve grip for upper body control
- Hip control with free hand or forearm
- Chest-to-chest connection during completion
- Shoulder pressure to prevent opponent from turning back in
- Body positioning to block opponent's hip mobility

## Common Counters
- [[Inversion Defense]] → [[Inverted Guard]]
- [[Underhook Recovery]] → [[Half Guard Bottom]]
- [[Shin Shield]] → [[Shin-to-Shin Guard]]
- [[Berimbolo Counter]] → [[Back Control]]
- [[Granby Roll]] → [[Guard Recovery]]

## Variants
- Traditional leg drag (cross-body control)
- Modified leg drag (lapel control)
- Standing leg drag
- Double-under leg drag
- Leg drag to back take
- Leg drag to mount
- No-gi leg drag variations
- Reverse leg drag

## Expert Insights
- **Danaher System**: Emphasizes the leg drag as a systematic approach to neutralizing guard retention mechanics, focusing on precise control points that limit the opponent's hip mobility while maintaining proper base throughout the pass. Creates clear mechanical principles for managing the opponent's defensive frames and preventing common counter-attacks.
- **Gordon Ryan**: Utilizes the leg drag extensively within an integrated passing system, emphasizing the importance of head position and shoulder pressure during the final stages of the pass. Often connects the leg drag to back takes rather than traditional side control finishes, particularly when opponents turn away defensively.
- **Eddie Bravo**: Has adapted the leg drag principles to his no-gi 10th Planet system with modified gripping strategies and connections to his specialized control positions. Emphasizes using the leg drag as a pathway to the truck position and other 10th Planet-specific control points.

## Timing Considerations
- Execute when opponent's legs are extended or separated
- Time with opponent's attempt to establish a specific guard
- Perform after breaking opponent's grips
- Implement when opponent shifts weight to one side
- Use as counter to specific guard recovery attempts

## Follow-up Options
- [[Side Control Consolidation]] → [[Side Control]]
- [[Transition to Mount]] → [[Mount]]
- [[Back Step]] → [[Back Control]]
- [[Kimura Trap]] → [[Kimura Control]]
- [[North-South Transition]] → [[North-South]]
- [[Knee Cut Combination]] → [[Knee Cut Pass]]

## Common Errors
- Insufficient upper body control → Guard recovery opportunity
- Poor pressure during transition → Space creation
- Improper angle of attack → Inefficient mechanics
- Losing control of opponent's leg → Pass stalling
- Failing to address defensive frames → Technical barriers

## Computer Science Analogy
The Leg Drag Pass functions as an optimized algorithm in the BJJ state graph that effectively addresses multiple defensive states simultaneously. It implements a form of "parallel constraint satisfaction" by controlling both the opponent's legs and upper body while creating a geometric configuration that systematically eliminates defensive options. This creates a highly efficient state transition with exceptional success probability due to its ability to address multiple defensive scenarios through a single coherent passing structure.
