## Transition Description
The Double Leg Takedown is a fundamental wrestling-based technique adapted for BJJ where you attack both of your opponent's legs simultaneously to bring them to the ground. This powerful transition moves the fight from standing to the ground with you in a dominant top position. When executed properly, it bypasses the opponent's guard entirely, potentially landing directly in side control. The technique relies on precise timing, explosive penetration, and strategic control to overcome defensive reactions, making it a cornerstone of takedown strategies in competitive BJJ and MMA contexts.

## Visual Execution Sequence
Detailed description for clear visualization of the transition in action:

From a standing position, you face your opponent in a neutral stance, maintaining a balanced athletic posture with your lead foot forward, knees slightly bent, and weight centered, ready to exploit any opening. You create an opportunity through a subtle feint or by reacting to their forward movement, dropping your level swiftly by bending your knees while keeping your back straight and head up to avoid telegraphing your intent. As you lower your center of gravity, you drive forward explosively with your lead leg, penetrating your hips forward to close the distance, aligning your head, shoulders, and hips for maximum impact. Your arms wrap around both of the opponent's legs at or above the knees, hands connecting or wrists clasping behind their thighs, while your head is positioned tight to their body, ideally outside their hip to maintain control. With a powerful drive forward and upward, you lift the opponent off balance, using your shoulder pressure against their lower abdomen to disrupt their base. Finally, you guide them to the ground while maintaining control of their legs, transitioning immediately to secure a top position like side control by passing their legs if necessary, ensuring they cannot recover guard easily.

**Template**: "From standing, face opponent in neutral stance, balanced with lead foot forward. Create opportunity with feint or reaction, drop level with knees bent, back straight. Drive forward explosively with lead leg, penetrate hips to close distance. Wrap arms around both legs at knees, connect hands behind thighs, head tight to body. Lift opponent off balance with forward and upward drive, shoulder against abdomen. Guide to ground, control legs, transition to side control or top position."

## Execution Steps
1. Create an opening through feints, level changes, or timed reactions to disrupt opponent's defensive posture.
2. Drop level with bent knees, keeping back straight and head up to maintain balance and avoid counters.
3. Drive forward with lead leg while penetrating hips forward to close distance explosively.
4. Wrap both arms around opponent's legs at or above the knees for secure control.
5. Connect hands or clasp wrists behind opponent's legs to lock in the grip.
6. Drive forward and upward with shoulder pressure against opponent's lower abdomen, lifting them off balance.
7. Guide opponent to ground while maintaining control of legs to prevent guard recovery.
8. Transition immediately to secure top position, passing legs if necessary to achieve side control.

## Key Details
- **Double Leg Control**: Hands connected behind knees or thighs for secure grip.
- **Head Position**: Tight to opponent's body, preferably outside hip to avoid counters.
- **Shoulder Pressure**: Applied against opponent's lower abdomen to disrupt balance.
- **Hip Connection**: Essential for maximum drive and lifting power during takedown.
- **Elbow Control**: Used during finish to prevent opponent from posting or escaping.
- **Penetration Angle**: Slight angle often preferable to direct frontal approach for better control.
- **Timing Recognition**: Identifying optimal windows when opponent's weight is forward.
- **Defensive Awareness**: Maintaining readiness to adjust to sprawls or submission counters.

## Common Counters and Counter-Attacks
Analysis of opponent responses with success rates for counter-attacks:
- [[Sprawl Defense]] → [[Front Headlock]] (Success Rate: 60%, Conditions: opponent sprawls hips back to counter takedown)
- [[Whizzer Counter]] → [[Underhook Standing]] (Success Rate: 50%, Conditions: opponent overhooks arm to resist lift)
- [[Guillotine Counter]] → [[Guillotine Control]] (Success Rate: 45%, Conditions: opponent capitalizes on lowered head for choke)
- [[Crossface Defense]] → [[Neutral Standing]] (Success Rate: 40%, Conditions: opponent uses crossface to redirect attack)
- [[Limp Leg Escape]] → [[Neutral Standing]] (Success Rate: 35%, Conditions: opponent pulls legs out during descent)
- [[Underhook Defense]] → [[Angle Restriction]] (Success Rate: 55%, Conditions: opponent secures underhooks to block penetration angle)

## Decision Logic for Opponent Behavior
```
If [opponent weight] is forward or during movement:
- Execute [[Double Leg Takedown]] (Probability: 80%)

Else if [opponent posture] is defensively strong:
- Attempt [[Feint or Level Change]] to create opening (Probability: 50%)

Else if [opponent sprawl] is initiated early:
- Adjust to [[Front Headlock Transition]] (Probability: 60%)

Else if [opponent underhook] blocks angle:
- Switch to [[Single Leg Takedown]] (Probability: 55%)

Else [maintain control]:
- Reset stance and wait for better timing (Probability: 40%)
```

## Variants
- Blast Double (maximum explosion, minimal setup for speed)
- Running Double (continuous forward pressure for relentless attack)
- High Double (gripping at thighs rather than knees for higher control)
- Low Double (diving attack with head outside for lower penetration)
- Single to Double (beginning with single leg control, transitioning to double)

## Expert Insights
- **John Danaher**: "The Double Leg Takedown emphasizes precise mechanical details over raw explosion, focusing on the correct penetration angle and connection of head, hands, and hips throughout the technique. I teach systematic methods to deal with each defensive response, ensuring practitioners can adapt mid-attack. The key is maintaining control through the descent to secure a dominant position, avoiding the opponent's guard recovery."
- **Gordon Ryan**: "I incorporate feints and strategic setups into the Double Leg Takedown rather than relying on pure athleticism. My approach connects the takedown to a seamless passing system designed to reach back control rather than staying in side control. Timing and misdirection are critical to bypassing strong defensive postures, making this a high-percentage move in competition."
- **Eddie Bravo**: "While I often favor guard pulling over traditional takedowns, when using doubles, I focus on immediate transitions to leg entanglements or the truck position rather than conventional top positions. The Double Leg can be adapted for no-gi by prioritizing control over completion. I emphasize unconventional follow-ups to catch opponents off-guard after the takedown."

## Common Errors

  - **Correction**: Drop level swiftly without excessive upper body movement
  - **Recognition**: Opponent steps back or sprawls before penetration
- **Error**: Dropping head too early
  - **Why It Fails**: Exposes neck to guillotine or head control counters
  - **Correction**: Keep head up until penetration, positioning outside hip during drive
  - **Recognition**: Opponent grabs head or neck during takedown attempt
- **Error**: Inadequate penetration drive
  - **Why It Fails**: Fails to close distance or disrupt balance effectively
  - **Correction**: Drive off rear leg explosively with hips forward for impact
  - **Recognition**: Gap remains or opponent maintains balance after initial step
- **Error**: Poor grip connection
  - **Why It Fails**: Loses control of legs, allowing opponent to escape or recover
  - **Correction**: Ensure hands connect or wrists clasp securely behind legs
  - **Recognition**: Legs slip out during lift or descent
- **Error**: Neglecting follow-through

## Historical Context
The Double Leg Takedown originates from freestyle and folkstyle wrestling, becoming a staple in Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu through cross-training and the emphasis on takedowns in competitive formats like IBJJF and ADCC. Its adaptation into BJJ reflects the art's evolution as a hybrid martial system, integrating wrestling principles with ground control strategies. The technique gained prominence with practitioners like Rodolfo Vieira and Gordon Ryan, who demonstrated its effectiveness in high-level competition. It remains a foundational takedown for controlling an opponent's position from standing.

## Conceptual Framework
The Double Leg Takedown embodies core BJJ and wrestling principles of control, timing, and energy efficiency. It leverages explosive penetration and strategic grip control to disrupt an opponent's balance, creating a high-probability transition to a dominant position. The technique illustrates how physical attributes like explosiveness can be paired with precise mechanics to overcome defensive disparities. It serves as a critical element in a comprehensive standing game for competitive grapplers.

## Computer Science Analogy
The Double Leg Takedown functions as a "state transition function" in the BJJ state machine, executing a direct shift from a standing neutral state to a dominant ground state. This represents a form of "deterministic state change," where the input conditions (opponent's posture and weight distribution) are systematically exploited to achieve a predictable output (top position). Like a well-optimized algorithm, the takedown minimizes energy expenditure by leveraging the opponent's momentum, similar to how efficient code reuses existing resources. The technique demonstrates the principle of "error handling" by incorporating defensive awareness to adapt to counters like sprawls or submissions during execution.
