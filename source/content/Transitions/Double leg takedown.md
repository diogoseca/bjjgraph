## Transition Description
The Double Leg Takedown is a fundamental wrestling-based technique adapted for BJJ where you attack both of your opponent's legs simultaneously. This powerful transition moves the fight from standing to the ground with you in a dominant top position. When executed properly, it bypasses the opponent's guard entirely, potentially landing directly in side control.

## Execution Steps
1. Create an opening through feints, level changes, or timed reactions
2. Drop level with bent knees, back straight, head up
3. Drive forward with lead leg while penetrating hips forward
4. Wrap both arms around opponent's legs at or above the knees
5. Connect hands or clasp wrists behind opponent's legs
6. Drive forward and upward, lifting opponent off balance
7. Guide opponent to ground while maintaining control of legs
8. Transition immediately to secure top position (pass legs if necessary)

## Key Grips/Controls
- Double leg control (hands connected behind knees or thighs)
- Head position (tight to body, preferably outside hip)
- Shoulder pressure against opponent's lower abdomen
- Hip connection for maximum drive
- Elbow control during finish to prevent post

## Common Counters
- [[Sprawl Defense]] → [[Front Headlock]]
- [[Whizzer Counter]] → [[Underhook Standing]]
- [[Guillotine Counter]] → [[Guillotine Control]]
- [[Crossface Defense]] → [[Neutral Standing]]
- [[Limp Leg Escape]] → [[Neutral Standing]]

## Variants
- Blast double (maximum explosion, minimal setup)
- Running double (continuous forward pressure)
- High double (gripping at thighs rather than knees)
- Low double (diving attack with head outside)
- Single to double (beginning with single leg control)

## Expert Insights
- **Danaher System**: Emphasizes precise mechanical details over explosion, focusing on correct penetration angle and connection of head, hands and hips throughout the technique. Teaches systematic methods to deal with each defensive response.
- **Gordon Ryan**: Incorporates feints and strategic setups rather than relying on pure athleticism. Connects the double leg to a seamless passing system designed to reach back control rather than staying in side control.
- **Eddie Bravo**: Often eschews traditional takedowns in favor of guard pulling, but when using doubles, focuses on immediate transition to leg entanglements or the truck position rather than conventional top positions.

## Timing Considerations
- Execute when opponent's weight is forward
- Time with opponent's movement or step
- Follow immediately after breaking opponent's posture or grip
- Use after creating level change reactions with feints
- Implement as counter to aggressive forward pressure

## Follow-up Options
- [[Leg Pass]] → [[Side Control]]
- [[Knee Cut Pass]] → [[Side Control]]
- [[Pin and Control]] → [[Top Half Guard]]
- [[Back Step]] → [[Top Headquarters]]
- [[Transition to Mount]] → [[Mount]]
