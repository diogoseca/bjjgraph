## Transition Description
The Leg Drag Setup is a preparatory technique in Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu (BJJ) used to position oneself for the Leg Drag Pass from a top position in Open Guard or De La Riva Guard. This setup involves establishing the initial grips and body positioning necessary to disrupt the opponent's guard structure by targeting one of their legs for dragging across their body. It is a critical first step in executing the full Leg Drag Pass, embodying the BJJ principle of strategic preparation to maximize the effectiveness of subsequent movements. The Leg Drag Setup is applicable in both gi and no-gi grappling, providing a foundation for a high-percentage guard passing sequence.

## Visual Execution Sequence
Detailed description for clear visualization of the transition in action:

Starting in top Open Guard, you are standing with your opponent on their back, their legs actively framing against your torso, with their right foot on your left hip and their left foot near your right thigh, while their hands grip your pants or sleeves to control your posture and set up potential sweeps or submissions. To initiate the Leg Drag Setup, you first establish a strong posture by straightening your back and keeping your elbows tucked in, breaking their upper body control with minimal effort, ensuring you maintain balance and prevent submissions like triangles. You then step slightly to your left, angling your body to create a better line of attack for targeting their right leg, keeping your weight centered to avoid overcommitting and exposing yourself to sweeps. With precision, you secure a grip on their right pant leg near the ankle with your left hand, using a firm hold to prepare for the drag, while your right hand reaches to control their right knee or shin, preventing it from re-entangling or framing against you, feeling their initial resistance as you establish control over their leg. Mid-setup, you maintain your posture and grips, keeping your hips slightly back to avoid being pulled into their guard, ensuring their right leg is isolated and ready to be pulled across their body in the subsequent Leg Drag Pass, while monitoring their left leg for any defensive adjustments. You complete the setup by mentally preparing for the next step, visualizing the drag of their right leg towards your right side, maintaining a low energy expenditure as you position yourself for the pass, having successfully established the necessary control points to transition into the full Leg Drag Pass. Throughout the movement, you remain aware of their attempts to break your grips or re-guard, adjusting your stance and grip strength to counter their defenses, demonstrating a strategic setup technique that prepares you to bypass a complex guard position with calculated precision.

**Template**: "From top Open Guard, standing, opponent on back, legs framing torso, right foot on left hip, left near right thigh, hands gripping pants or sleeves for control. Establish strong posture, straighten back, tuck elbows to break control, maintain balance, prevent submissions. Step left to angle body for targeting right leg, keep weight centered to avoid sweeps. Grip right pant leg near ankle with left hand, firm hold for drag, control right knee with right hand to prevent entanglement, feel initial resistance. Maintain posture and grips mid-setup, hips back to avoid guard pull, isolate right leg for drag, monitor left leg adjustments. Prepare mentally for drag to right side, low energy use, position for pass, establish control for Leg Drag Pass. Stay aware of grip breaks or re-guard attempts, adjust stance and grip to counter, prepare to bypass complex guard with calculated precision."

## Execution Steps
1. Begin in top Open Guard or De La Riva Guard, recognizing the opportunity to set up a pass when the opponent's legs are accessible for control.
2. Establish a strong posture by straightening your back and tucking your elbows in to break their grip control over your upper body, maintaining balance to prevent submissions.
3. Step to one side (opposite the leg you intend to drag) to angle your body for the setup, keeping your weight centered to avoid overcommitting and exposing yourself to sweeps.
4. Secure a grip on the targeted leg near the ankle with one hand, using a firm hold to prepare for dragging, while controlling their knee or shin with your other hand to prevent re-entanglement or framing.
5. Maintain your posture and grips, keeping your hips slightly back to avoid being pulled into their guard, ensuring the targeted leg is isolated and ready for the subsequent drag across their body.
6. Monitor their other leg and upper body for defensive adjustments, mentally preparing for the next step of dragging the leg to initiate the full Leg Drag Pass, conserving energy during this preparatory phase.
7. Remain aware of their attempts to break your grips or re-guard, adjusting your stance and grip strength to counter their defenses and maintain control of the setup position.
8. Transition smoothly into the Leg Drag Pass by visualizing the drag direction and preparing your body to step forward, having established the necessary control points for the pass.

## Key Details
- **Posture Maintenance**: Essential to break opponent’s upper body control and prevent submissions.
- **Angled Positioning**: Stepping to one side creates an optimal angle for targeting the leg.
- **Grip Establishment**: Secure grip on ankle and knee/shin to isolate the targeted leg.
- **Hip Positioning**: Keep hips back to avoid being pulled into guard or off-balanced.
- **Defensive Awareness**: Monitor opponent’s other leg and upper body for counters.
- **Energy Conservation**: Minimize effort during setup to save energy for the pass.
- **Mental Preparation**: Visualize drag direction and next steps for smooth transition.
- **Control Focus**: Prioritize isolating the leg to disrupt guard structure early.

## Success Modifiers
Factors that influence the success rate of the transition:
- **Posture Strength**: Ability to maintain balance and resist opponent’s control (+10%)
- **Grip Precision**: Secure and effective control of targeted leg (+8%)
- **Angling Accuracy**: Proper body angle to optimize leg isolation (+7%)
- **Defensive Monitoring**: Awareness of opponent’s counters during setup (+5%)
- **Experience Level**: Familiarity with guard passing setups and transitions (+5% per skill level)

## Common Counters and Counter-Attacks
Analysis of opponent responses with success rates for counter-attacks:
- **Grip Break** → [[Guard Retention]] (Success Rate: 40%, Conditions: opponent breaks grip on ankle or knee to re-establish guard)
- **Leg Re-Entanglement** → [[De La Riva Guard]] (Success Rate: 35%, Conditions: opponent re-entangles leg to prevent isolation)
- **Upper Body Control** → [[Triangle Setup]] (Success Rate: 30%, Conditions: opponent pulls you into guard with posture control)
- **Sweep Attempt** → [[Bottom Position]] (Success Rate: 25%, Conditions: opponent uses setup moment to initiate sweep)
- **Counter Pass Defense** → [[Shin-to-Shin Guard]] (Success Rate: 20%, Conditions: opponent adjusts other leg to block pass path)

## Decision Logic for Transition
```
If [opponent legs] are accessible and guard structure is open:
- Initiate [[Leg Drag Setup]] for control (Probability: 80%)

Else if [opponent grip control] is weak or posture is breakable:
- Execute [[Leg Drag Setup]] to isolate leg (Probability: 75%)

Else if [opponent leg] can be targeted with minimal resistance:
- Attempt [[Leg Drag Setup]] to prepare for pass (Probability: 70%)

Else if [opponent counters] with grip breaks or re-entanglement mid-setup:
- Adjust to [[base maintenance]] for defense (Probability: 60%)

Else if [setup fails] due to strong guard retention or sweep threat:
- Reinforce [[Standing Guard]] to reset approach (Probability: 50%)
```

## Variants
- **Standard Leg Drag Setup**: Classic grip on ankle and knee for Open Guard.
- **De La Riva Specific Setup**: Adjusted grips to counter De La Riva hook control.
- **No-Gi Adaptation**: Focus on leg control without gi grips, using body pressure.
- **Double Leg Control Setup**: Controlling both legs initially before targeting one.
- **Feint Setup**: Using a fake pass direction to bait opponent before dragging.
- **Low Stance Setup**: Dropping to knees for closer control during setup.
- **Dynamic Step Setup**: Incorporating more movement to disrupt guard rhythm.
- **Grip Variation Setup**: Using sleeve or collar grips to assist leg isolation.

## Tactical Applications
- **Guard Disruption**: Primary use to break down complex guard structures.
