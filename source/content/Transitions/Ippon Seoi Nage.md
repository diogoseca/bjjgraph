- **Speed Requirements**: High for timing-dependent execution

## State Machine Content Elements

### Visual Execution Sequence
Detailed step-by-step description for clear movement sequence visualization:

From standing position with collar and sleeve control, you initiate the throw by pulling your opponent forward to break their balance. As they resist or step forward, you step deeply in front of them with your lead foot while simultaneously releasing your sleeve grip and driving that arm under their armpit, threading it through to grab their belt or back of their gi. You then bring your back foot close to your lead foot, dropping your hips below their center of gravity while turning your back to them completely. The key is to load their weight onto your back by pulling them forward with your collar grip and lifting with your arm that's threaded under their armpit. Once loaded, you explosively straighten your legs and rotate your torso, throwing them over your shoulder in a clean arc to land on their back. You follow through by maintaining control and landing in a dominant top position such as side control or mount.

**Template**: "From standing with collar-sleeve grips, pull opponent forward breaking balance. Drive arm under their armpit, step in deep, drop hips below theirs. Load weight on your back, explode upward rotating torso, throw over shoulder. Follow through to dominant top position."

### Execution Steps (Numbered Sequence)
1. **Setup Requirements**: Establish collar and sleeve grips from standing position
2. **Initial Movement**: Pull opponent forward to break their balance while stepping in
3. **Opponent Response**: Opponent typically resists or attempts to maintain posture
4. **Adaptation**: Adjust depth of entry and grip position based on resistance
5. **Completion**: Drive controlled arm under opponent's armpit and load them on your back
6. **Consolidation**: Explode upward and rotate to throw over shoulder to dominant position

### Key Technical Details
Critical elements that determine success:
- **Grip Requirements**: Deep collar grip and proper arm insertion under armpit
- **Base/Foundation**: Feet close together with hips dropped below opponent's center
- **Timing Windows**: Execute as opponent moves forward or is off-balance
- **Leverage Points**: Back and shoulder as fulcrum for throwing motion
- **Common Adjustments**: Vary entry depth and rotation speed based on opponent size

### Success Modifiers
Factors that increase/decrease probability:
- **Setup Quality**: Strong grips and deep arm insertion (+/-20%)
- **Timing Precision**: Executing during opponent's forward momentum (+/-20%)
- **Opponent Fatigue**: Reduced defensive reactions and balance (+/-5%)
- **Knowledge Test Performance**: Understanding throw mechanics (+/-10%)
- **Position Control**: Quality of hip entry and loading (+/-15%)

## Counter-Attack Analysis

### Common Counters
Opponent responses with success rates:
- **Hip Block**: Preventing deep entry with defensive stance → [[Clinch Position]] (Success Rate: 45%, Conditions: early recognition)
- **Posture Recovery**: Breaking grips and stepping back → [[Standing Position]] (Success Rate: 40%, Conditions: strong grip break)
- **Counter Throw**: Using momentum for own takedown → [[Top Position]] (Success Rate: 25%, Conditions: superior timing)
- **Sprawl Defense**: Dropping hips to prevent throw → [[Front Headlock]] (Success Rate: 30%, Conditions: wrestling background)

Format: `[[Counter Technique]] → [[Result State]] (Success Rate: X%, Conditions: [when applicable])`

### Decision Logic
```
If [hip entry] is blocked:
- Execute [[Hip Block]] (Probability: 45%)

Else if [throw setup] is recognized early:
- Execute [[Posture Recovery]] (Probability: 40%)

Else if [opponent has wrestling defense]:
- Execute [[Sprawl Defense]] (Probability: 30%)

Else if [momentum can be redirected]:
- Execute [[Counter Throw]] (Probability: 25%)

Else [optimal throw execution]:
- Accept transition (Probability: Success Rate - Modifiers)
```

## Educational Content

### Expert Insights
Commentary as if from recognized authorities:
- **John Danaher**: "Ippon seoi nage is the purest expression of shoulder throw mechanics in judo. The technique requires complete commitment - you must turn your back fully to the opponent and drop your hips below theirs. The arm threading under the armpit creates exceptional control compared to the two-handed version, but demands more precise timing and deeper entry. This throw teaches the principle of using your entire body as a lever."
- **Gordon Ryan**: "In high-level competition, ippon seoi nage is devastating because it often results in a hard throw that can immediately transition to mount or submission. I focus on the explosive power element - once you've loaded them on your back, the straightening of the legs must be violent and fast. The single arm control also sets up immediate attacks on that arm if the throw is defended."
- **Eddie Bravo**: "Ippon seoi nage represents the classic judo approach - high risk, high reward. In the 10th Planet system, we adapt this by using it as a setup for back takes when partially defended. The deep entry and rotation create excellent scramble opportunities. It's particularly effective in no-gi when you can control the tricep instead of the gi sleeve."

Each insight should focus on one key technical or strategic element.

### Common Errors
For knowledge test generation:
- **Error**: Shallow hip entry or insufficient dropping below opponent
- **Why It Fails**: Cannot load opponent's weight effectively on back
- **Correction**: Drop hips deeply below opponent's center of gravity before lifting
- **Recognition**: Throw feels heavy or opponent maintains their base

- **Error**: Arm not threaded deeply enough under armpit
- **Why It Fails**: Lacks control and allows opponent to escape or counter
- **Correction**: Drive arm all the way through to grab belt or back of gi
- **Recognition**: Opponent pulls arm free or resists loading

- **Error**: Insufficient balance breaking before entry
- **Why It Fails**: Opponent maintains stable base and blocks entry
- **Correction**: Pull strongly forward to create forward lean before stepping in
- **Recognition**: Unable to complete entry or opponent easily defends

### Timing Considerations
When to attempt this transition:
- **Optimal Conditions**: When opponent leans forward or steps into your pull
- **Avoid When**: Opponent maintains low, wide defensive stance
- **Setup Sequences**: After grip fighting that brings opponent forward
- **Follow-up Windows**: Must complete throw within 2-3 seconds

### Prerequisites
Requirements before attempting:
- **Technical Skills**: Advanced standing grip fighting and deep entry mechanics
- **Physical Preparation**: Hip flexibility and explosive leg power
- **Positional Understanding**: Standing position mechanics and kuzushi principles
- **Experience Level**: Advanced technique requiring commitment and timing

## Technical Assessment Elements

### Knowledge Assessment Questions
5 technical questions with multiple choice answers:
- **Mechanical Understanding**: "What creates the leverage in ippon seoi nage?"
- **Timing Recognition**: "When is the optimal moment to thread the arm under?"
- **Error Prevention**: "What is the most common hip entry mistake?"
- **Setup Requirements**: "Which grip transition is essential for the throw?"
- **Adaptation**: "How do you adjust if opponent blocks your hip entry?"

### Variants and Adaptations
Different versions for various scenarios:
- **Gi Specific**: Traditional belt or back grip for maximum control
- **No-Gi Specific**: Adapt to tricep control and overhook positions
- **Self-Defense**: Modified version for clothing grips in street situations
- **Competition**: High-scoring throw when executed cleanly
- **Size Differential**: Particularly effective for smaller practitioners against larger opponents

### Training Progressions
Skill development pathway:
- **Solo Practice**: Hip entry and rotation motion without partner
- **Cooperative Drilling**: Partner allows throw completion for timing development
- **Resistant Practice**: Partner provides progressive defensive resistance
- **Sparring Integration**: Implementing throw during live standing exchanges
- **Troubleshooting**: Identifying and correcting entry depth issues

## Audio & Narration Elements

### Action Descriptions
Dynamic language for TTS narration:
