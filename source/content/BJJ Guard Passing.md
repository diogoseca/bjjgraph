## Passing Philosophy

Guard passing is a chess match - reading your opponent's defense and applying the right technique at the right moment.

### Two Primary Passing Styles

**1. Pressure Passing**
- Philosophy: Pin them down, exhaust them, pass slowly
- Requires: Weight distribution, pressure, patience
- Best against: Aggressive guard players
- Energy cost: Medium
- Example practitioners: Bernardo Faria, Lucas Lepri

**2. Speed Passing**
- Philosophy: Move faster than they can react
- Requires: Explosiveness, timing, agility
- Best against: Slow guard players, larger opponents
- Energy cost: High
- Example practitioners: Gui Mendes, Cobrinha, Rafa Mendes

**3. Hybrid Approach** (Most Effective)
- Mix pressure and speed
- Read opponent's defense
- Switch between styles
- Example practitioners: Gordon Ryan, Roger Gracie

### Passing Principles

**Universal Passing Concepts:**

1. **Posture** - Maintain strong posture (closed guard)
2. **Control** - Control hips, legs, or grips
3. **Direction** - Choose the path of least resistance
4. **Commitment** - Finish the pass completely
5. **Base** - Maintain balance throughout
6. **Pressure** - Use weight strategically
7. **Consolidation** - Secure side control/mount after passing

### The Three Passing Stages

**Stage 1: Guard Opening/Clearing**
- Break closed guard OR clear open guard legs
- Control distance
- Establish passing grips

**Stage 2: The Pass Itself**
- Navigate past the legs
- Control hips
- Maintain pressure or speed

**Stage 3: Consolidation**
- Secure side control
- Establish control
- Prevent reguarding

**Critical Truth:** Most failed passes happen in Stage 3 (not finishing/consolidating)

---

## Pressure Passes

Pressure passes use weight, control, and grinding pressure to force the pass.

### Smash Pass (Headquarters Pass)

**[[Smash Pass]]** - Fundamental pressure pass
- From: Half Guard → To: Side Control
- Success Rate: Very high with proper pressure
- Complexity: Medium
- Best Against: Active half guard players

**Execution:**
1. Establish crossface (forearm across face)
2. Underhook far side
3. Drive shoulder pressure into face
4. Flatten opponent
5. Clear leg with knee slide
6. Establish side control

**Key Details:**
- Crossface is critical (blocks vision, controls head)
- Shoulder pressure creates discomfort
- Weight on their chest, not legs
- Patient grinding pressure
- Also called: Crossface pass

**Variations:**
- **Headquarters smash** - From [[Headquarters Position]]
- **Double underhooks** - Both arms under
- **Gi grips** - Using collar and pants

**Common Mistakes:**
- Rushing without establishing pressure
- Weight too far back
- Weak crossface
- Not flattening opponent first

### Stack Pass

**[[Stack Pass]]** - Folding pressure pass
- From: Closed Guard/Open Guard → To: Side Control
- Success Rate: High against flexible opponents
- Complexity: Medium
- Best Against: Bottom players with good guard retention

**Execution:**
1. Control both legs (usually pants grips in gi)
2. Drive forward, stacking opponent's legs toward face
3. Pin hips to ground with your weight
4. Walk around legs to side
5. Establish side control

**Key Details:**
- Stack early before they extend legs
- Weight drives down and forward
- Walk around in arc
- Keep pressure throughout
- Can go to either side

**Variations:**

## Passing Systems & Strategic Frameworks

Advanced passing requires systems, not just individual techniques.

### The Pressure Passing System

**Philosophy:** Grind them down, exhaust their defenses

**Core Techniques:**
1. [[Smash Pass]]
2. [[Stack Pass]]
3. [[Knee Cut Pass]]
4. [[Body Lock Pass]]

**System Flow:**
- Start with body lock or headquarters
- Apply crossface and shoulder pressure
- If they turn away: back take
- If they try to reguard: knee cut
- If they frame: stack
- If they lockdown: headquarters to smash

**Key Principle:** Never stop pressure, switch between passes as they defend

### The Speed Passing System

**Philosophy:** Move faster than they can react

**Core Techniques:**
1. [[Toreando Pass]]
2. [[Leg Drag Pass]]
3. [[Leg Weave Pass]]

**System Flow:**
- Control legs/grips
- Read their weight distribution
- Attack opening quickly
- If one pass fails, immediately try another
- Keep them on defensive

**Key Principle:** Constant movement, don't let them settle

### The Over-Under System (Faria System)

**Named after:** Bernardo Faria

**Core Concept:**
- One arm over leg, one arm under leg
- Maximum control
- Pressure-based
- Very difficult to defend

**Positions:**
- Over-under from closed guard
- Over-under from open guard
- Over-under from half guard

**Strength:** Works against almost any guard with proper technique

### Headquarters System

**[[Headquarters Position]]** - Control position for passing
- [[Headquarters Control]] - Establishing the position

**Philosophy:**
- Control position before passing
- Multiple pass options
- Defensive security

**From Headquarters:**
- Smash passes
- Stack passes
- Knee cuts
- Back takes
- Leg attacks

**Key Advantage:** Very hard to sweep from headquarters

### Leg Drag System

**Modern no-gi passing specialization**

**Core Components:**
- [[Leg Drag Pass]]
- [[Leg Drag Setup]]
- [[Leg Drag Position]]
- Back take entries

**System Flow:**
- Establish leg drag grip
- Drag leg across
- Choose: pass to side OR take back
- If they defend: opposite leg drag
- If they turn: back take

**Used By:** Gordon Ryan, Garry Tonon, modern no-gi competitors

- Control distance

**Short/Stocky Opponent:**
- Stay at distance
- Speed passes
- Avoid being pulled in

### Competition Passing

**When Winning:**

---

## Common Passing Mistakes

### Technical Errors

1. **Poor posture** (closed guard)
   - Gets swept or submitted
   - Fix: Strong back, hips back

2. **Not controlling hips**
   - Opponent reguards
   - Fix: Pin hips throughout pass

3. **Rushing**
   - Lose control and position

**Half Guard Passing:**
- Start in half guard top
- Pass to side control
- Opponent uses full resistance

### Flow Passing

**Light resistance passing:**
- Partner allows passing
- Focus on technique, not force
- Learn movement patterns
- Build muscle memory

### Competition Passing

**Full resistance:**
- Opponent fights with 100%
- Realistic timing
- Strategic decision-making
- Builds competition confidence

### Solo Passing Drills

**Without partner:**
- Footwork patterns
- Knee cut angles
- Sprawl movements
- Grip fighting shadowboxing

## Passing Defense (Guard Retention)

Understanding how to pass helps you defend passes:

**Against Pressure Passes:**
- Create frames
- Stay mobile
- Recover guard actively
- Don't get flat

**Against Speed Passes:**
- Control distance
- Grip fight
- Anticipate direction
- Reguard immediately

**Universal Defense:**
- [[Guard Retention]] system

## The Passing Mindset

"**Position before submission - and passing IS position.**"

The guard pass is where matches are won:

- Dominant position begins with passing
- Submissions come from passed guards

Your passing game should be:

2. **Adaptable** - Pressure AND speed
3. **Relentless** - Never stop attacking
4. **Consolidating** - Always finish the pass
5. **Strategic** - Read and react to defense

Elite guard passers:
- Never get frustrated
- Mix multiple passing styles
- Read defenses instantly
- Consolidate completely
- Create no-win scenarios for guard players
