## Transition Properties
- **Transition ID**: T801
- **Starting State**: [[De La Riva Guard]]
- **Ending State**: [[Back Control]]
- **Success Probability**: Beginner (30%), Intermediate (60%), Advanced (80%)
- **Execution Complexity**: High
- **Physical Attributes**: Hip mobility (High), Inversion comfort (High), Core strength (Medium)

## Transition Description
The Berimbolo is a modern dynamic technique that uses a rolling inversion from De La Riva guard to take the opponent's back. This sophisticated movement combines principles of guard sweeping with immediate positional advancement to bypass conventional positional hierarchies. Instead of simply reversing position from bottom to top, the Berimbolo allows the practitioner to transition directly from a guard position to the most dominant control position in BJJ (back control), making it one of the most efficient pathways in the BJJ state machine.

## Execution Steps
1. From De La Riva guard, secure a grip on opponent's same-side pant leg or ankle
2. Establish collar or belt control with your other hand (gi) or secure upper body control (no-gi)
3. Use your De La Riva hook to off-balance opponent toward their controlled leg
4. Initiate the inversion by bringing your non-hooking leg across opponent's body
5. Roll to your shoulder, inverting your position while maintaining grips
6. Keep tension on opponent's controlled leg throughout the movement
7. As you invert, spin underneath opponent while pulling their leg across your body
8. Continue the spin to come up on your side facing your opponent's back
9. Secure the back position by establishing hooks and seatbelt control

## Key Grips/Controls
- De La Riva hook (initial control)
- Pant/ankle grip on same side as hook
- Collar/belt grip or upper body control
- Leg tension throughout movement
- Sequential weight transfer during inversion
- Hip connection during final phase
- Back control grips (seatbelt and hooks)

## Common Counters
- [[Base and Posture]] → [[Passing Opportunity]]
- [[Leg Drag Counter]] → [[Leg Drag Position]]
- [[Backstep]] → [[Knee Cut Position]]
- [[Forward Pressure]] → [[Smash Pass]]
- [[Sitting Back]] → [[Double Pull Situation]]

## Variants
- Traditional berimbolo (full inversion to back)
- Crab ride berimbolo (transitional phase control)
- Kiss of the dragon (modified entry with different angle)
- Baby bolo (abbreviated version with less inversion)
- Double pull berimbolo (from seated guard vs seated guard)
- No-gi berimbolo adaptations

## Expert Insights
- **Danaher System**: While not emphasizing the berimbolo as a primary technique, acknowledges its utility when integrated with systematic back-attacking principles. Focuses on the mechanical requirements that make the technique successful, particularly the importance of maintaining tension on the opponent's controlled leg throughout the movement.
- **Gordon Ryan**: Employs berimbolo-type movements selectively, often as part of a larger system of forcing defensive reactions. Emphasizes positional control during the transitional phases rather than rushing to complete the technique, creating a series of controllable decision points.
- **Eddie Bravo**: Has adapted aspects of the berimbolo for no-gi through the "Truck" system and various rolling back takes. Emphasizes modified gripping strategies and creating unique control positions during the transitional phases rather than the traditional gi-based approach.

## Timing Considerations
- Execute when opponent is standing with weight on non-hooked leg
- Perform immediately after breaking opponent's posture
- Time with opponent's attempt to initiate a pass
- Implement when specific grips are secured
- Use as opponent begins to disengage from the guard

## Follow-up Options
- [[Back Control Consolidation]] → [[Back Control]]
- [[Crab Ride Control]] → [[Crab Ride]]
- [[Crucifix Transition]] → [[Crucifix]]
- [[Leg Drag from Back]] → [[Leg Drag Position]]
- [[Back Triangle]] → [[Triangle Control]]

## Historical Context
The berimbolo emerged in high-level competition around 2010-2012, pioneered by the Mendes brothers, Miyao brothers, and other emerging competitors from the new generation of guard players. It represented a paradigm shift in BJJ by challenging the traditional positional hierarchy and creating direct pathways from inferior positions to dominant ones through dynamic movement rather than step-by-step advancement.

## Computer Science Analogy
The Berimbolo represents a computational "shortcut" in the BJJ state graph - a high-difficulty but high-reward edge that connects a neutral position (De La Riva Guard) directly to the most dominant control position (Back Control), bypassing several intermediate nodes. It has a steep learning curve (high initial cost) but offers exceptional efficiency (shortest path to optimal position) once mastered, similar to how certain advanced algorithms require significant implementation complexity but provide dramatically improved performance.
