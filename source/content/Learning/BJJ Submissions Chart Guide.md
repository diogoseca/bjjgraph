## Introduction: The Strategic Value of Submission Charts

Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu is often described as "human chess" - a game of position, strategy, and calculated attacks. Just as chess players study opening theory and endgame patterns, BJJ practitioners benefit enormously from understanding the submission landscape through comprehensive charts and visual maps. A well-designed submissions chart transforms scattered knowledge into a systematic framework, revealing the hidden connections between techniques and positions.

**Why Submission Charts Matter:**

Unlike striking arts where you can throw the same punch from countless positions, BJJ submissions are highly position-dependent. An armbar from [[Mount]] requires completely different mechanics than an armbar from [[Closed Guard Bottom]]. A submission chart makes these positional relationships crystal clear, showing you exactly which finishes are available from each position and how they connect to form devastating attack sequences.

The best submission charts go beyond simple categorization. They incorporate success rate data across skill levels, showing white belts which techniques offer the best risk-reward ratio while revealing to advanced practitioners how seemingly unrelated submissions can chain together into unstoppable attack systems. This data-driven approach, pioneered by systematic coaches like John Danaher, has revolutionized modern BJJ instruction.

**What This Guide Covers:**

This comprehensive submission chart guide organizes 30+ finishing techniques by position, category, and effectiveness. You'll find position-based submission maps with realistic success rates, submission chains that exploit defensive reactions, belt-specific learning priorities, and expert insights from the sport's most successful coaches and competitors. Whether you're a white belt learning your first [[Triangle Choke]] or a black belt refining your [[Inside Heel Hook]] system, this guide provides the strategic framework to accelerate your submission game.

## Understanding Submission Categories

BJJ submissions fall into four primary categories, each attacking different anatomical targets with distinct mechanical principles:

### Chokes (Strangulations)

Chokes represent the highest-percentage finishing category in BJJ, accounting for approximately 45% of all submissions in high-level competition. They work by restricting blood flow to the brain (blood chokes) or air flow to the lungs (air chokes), with blood chokes being far more effective and preferred.

**Key Characteristics:**
- Fastest time to unconsciousness (8-13 seconds for blood chokes)
- Work equally well in gi and no-gi
- Less dependent on size and strength differentials
- Difficult to "tough out" compared to joint locks
- Lower injury risk when applied with control

**Primary Choke Types:**
- Rear strangulations: [[Rear Naked Choke]], [[Bow and Arrow]]
- Front strangulations: [[Guillotine Sequence]], [[Darce Choke]], [[Anaconda Choke]]
- Gi-specific chokes: [[Cross Collar Choke]], [[Loop Choke]], [[Baseball Bat Choke]]
- Hybrid chokes: [[Arm Triangle Progression]], [[Triangle Choke]]

### Arm Locks (Upper Body Joint Attacks)

Arm locks target the elbow joint primarily, with some variations attacking the shoulder. They comprise roughly 30% of competition submissions and offer the advantage of being available from nearly every position.

**Key Characteristics:**
- More time to tap (2-5 seconds) before injury
- Require precise angle and hip engagement
- Highly technical with narrow margin for error
- Can be muscled out by strong opponents if not locked tight
- Natural connection to other submissions in chains

**Primary Arm Lock Types:**
- Straight armbars: [[Armbar Finish]], [[Armbar from Closed Guard]], [[Armbar from Mount]]
- Bent arm locks: [[Kimura]], [[Americana]], [[Omoplata]]
- Standing arm locks: [[Flying Armbar]], [[Armbar from Standing]]

### Leg Locks (Lower Body Joint Attacks)

Leg locks have evolved from a niche specialty to a core component of modern BJJ, especially in no-gi competition. They now account for 15-20% of high-level submissions, with that percentage increasing annually.

**Key Characteristics:**
- Limited pain warning before structural damage
- Require specialized positional systems ([[Ashi Garami]], [[Saddle Variations Bottom]])
- Controversial rule restrictions in IBJJF (heel hooks banned below black belt)
- Devastating effectiveness in submission-only formats
- Steep learning curve with high injury risk if practiced incorrectly

**Primary Leg Lock Types:**
- Heel hooks: [[Inside Heel Hook]], [[Outside Heel Hook]]
- Straight ankle locks: [[Straight Footlock]]
- Knee attacks: [[Kneebar]], [[Calf Slicer]]

### Shoulder Locks

Shoulder locks are the rarest submission category (5-10% of finishes) but offer unique advantages in specific positions. They're particularly effective in no-gi scenarios where collar grips are unavailable.

**Key Characteristics:**
- Require exceptional control to finish safely
- Often used as control positions rather than pure submissions
- Can be held for extended time to drain opponent's energy
- High injury risk if forced explosively
- Natural transitions to other submission categories

**Primary Shoulder Lock Types:**
- [[Kimura]] (also functions as arm lock)
- [[Omoplata]] (hybrid shoulder/arm attack)
- [[Williams Shoulder Lock]]
- [[Twister Finish]] (extreme spinal/shoulder attack)

## Position-Based Submission Charts

Understanding which submissions are available from each position is the foundation of systematic attacking. This section maps the highest-percentage finishes from the five major offensive positions, complete with success rates across skill levels.

### From Mount (10+ Submissions Available)

[[Mount]] is considered the premier submission position in traditional BJJ, offering 4 points and dominant control. The mounted attacker has multiple attack vectors: arms, neck, and transitions to even more dominant positions.

**Success Rate by Position:** Competition data shows 25-30% overall submission rate from mount, with the percentage increasing significantly at higher belt levels.

**Primary Submissions from Mount:**

1. **Cross Collar Choke** → [[Cross Collar Choke]]
   - Success Rate: Beginner 45%, Intermediate 60%, Advanced 75%
   - Setup: Establish high mount, secure deep cross collar grips
   - Advantage: Gi-specific, extremely high percentage when grips secured
   - Counter vulnerability: Guard recovery before grips locked

2. **Armbar from Mount** → [[Mount to Armbar]]
   - Success Rate: Beginner 50%, Intermediate 65%, Advanced 80%
   - Setup: Break posture, isolate arm, swing leg over head
   - Advantage: Works gi and no-gi, natural chain to triangle
   - Counter vulnerability: Stack defense if hips not controlled

3. **Ezekiel Choke** → [[Ezekiel Choke]]
   - Success Rate: Beginner 35%, Intermediate 50%, Advanced 65%
   - Setup: Forearm under neck, opposite hand grips own sleeve
   - Advantage: Available even with opponent's strong defensive frames
   - Counter vulnerability: Explosive bridge and shrimp escape

4. **Americana** → [[Americana]]
   - Success Rate: Beginner 40%, Intermediate 55%, Advanced 70%
   - Setup: Pin hand to mat, figure-four grip, rotate to shoulder
   - Advantage: Simple mechanics, teaches bent-arm control principles
   - Counter vulnerability: Can be countered with upa bridge

5. **Triangle from Mount** → [[Triangle Choke]]
   - Success Rate: Beginner 30%, Intermediate 45%, Advanced 65%
   - Setup: High mount, arm across neck, lock triangle
   - Advantage: Finishing position extremely secure
   - Counter vulnerability: Requires significant positional transition

**Expert Insight - John Danaher:**
"Mount submissions succeed because they offer multiple attack vectors simultaneously. The opponent must defend their neck, both arms, and their base - creating a 'choose your death' scenario. Focus on establishing high mount and threatening the cross collar choke, which forces arms high, opening the armbar. This systematic approach - using one threat to set up another - is the essence of effective mount attacks."

### From Back Control (8+ Submissions Available)

[[Back Control]] offers the highest submission success rate of any position (35-40% in competition). The attacking position controls the opponent's back and hips, limiting their defensive options while threatening the neck and arms.

**Primary Submissions from Back Control:**

1. **Rear Naked Choke** → [[Rear Naked Choke]]
   - Success Rate: Beginner 70%, Intermediate 80%, Advanced 90%
   - Setup: Secure both hooks, slide arm under chin, complete choke
   - Advantage: Highest percentage submission in BJJ
   - Counter vulnerability: Hand fighting and chin protection

2. **Bow and Arrow Choke** → [[Bow and Arrow Choke]]
   - Success Rate: Beginner 55%, Intermediate 70%, Advanced 85%
   - Setup: Secure collar grip, control near leg, extend body
   - Advantage: Gi-specific, combines collar choke with leg control
   - Counter vulnerability: Requires one hook removed

3. **Armbar from Back** → [[Armbar from Back Control]]
   - Success Rate: Beginner 45%, Intermediate 60%, Advanced 75%
   - Setup: Isolate defending arm, transition to armbar position
   - Advantage: Natural backup when choke defense is strong
   - Counter vulnerability: Loss of back control during transition

4. **Short Choke** → [[Short Choke]]
   - Success Rate: Beginner 40%, Intermediate 55%, Advanced 70%
   - Setup: Palm-to-palm grip behind head, squeeze elbows
   - Advantage: Fast finish when hand fighting occurs
   - Counter vulnerability: Requires specific grip fight scenario

**Expert Insight - Gordon Ryan:**
"Back control is the king of positions because the opponent cannot see your attacks. My entire game is built around back takes. I focus on the body triangle to remove lower body defense, then systematically attack the neck. If they defend high, the armbar opens. If they defend the armbar, the neck reopens. The key is patience - maintain position and let them exhaust themselves defending."

### From Side Control (6+ Submissions Available)

[[Side Control Top]] offers solid control with 4 points, though submissions generally require more setup than from mount or back. The position excels at wearing down opponents and transitioning to more dominant positions.

**Primary Submissions from Side Control:**

1. **Kimura from Side Control** → [[Kimura from Side Control]]
   - Success Rate: Beginner 50%, Intermediate 65%, Advanced 78%
   - Setup: Isolate far arm, figure-four grip, break arm from mat
   - Advantage: Strong control, multiple finish options
   - Counter vulnerability: Can be countered with defensive grip

2. **Americana** → [[Americana]]
   - Success Rate: Beginner 45%, Intermediate 60%, Advanced 75%
   - Setup: Near arm pinned to mat, figure-four grip, rotate
   - Advantage: Simple mechanics for beginners
   - Counter vulnerability: Opponent can sometimes bridge escape

3. **Arm Triangle** → [[Arm Triangle Progression]]
   - Success Rate: Beginner 40%, Intermediate 58%, Advanced 73%
   - Setup: Trap near arm and head, lock figure-four, apply pressure
   - Advantage: High percentage in no-gi
   - Counter vulnerability: Requires position change to finish

4. **Paper Cutter Choke** → [[Paper Cutter Choke]]
   - Success Rate: Beginner 35%, Intermediate 50%, Advanced 68%
   - Setup: Deep collar grip, drive forearm across neck
   - Advantage: Gi-specific, surprising finish angle
   - Counter vulnerability: Requires precise collar depth

**Expert Insight - Eddie Bravo:**
"From side control, I'm always thinking about the twister series. But for most people, the Kimura is king. It's not just a submission - it's a system. You can sweep with it, take the back, transition to mount, or finish the shoulder lock. The Kimura trap from side control is one of the highest-percentage control systems in all of grappling."

### From Guard (20+ Submissions Available)

Guard positions ([[Closed Guard Bottom]], [[Open Guard Bottom]], [[Half Guard Bottom]]) offer the most submission variety but generally lower success rates (15-25%) due to being the bottom position. However, guard submissions are fundamental to developing a complete game.

**Primary Submissions from Guard:**

1. **Triangle Choke** → [[Triangle Choke]]
   - Success Rate: Beginner 55%, Intermediate 70%, Advanced 85%
   - Setup: Break posture, isolate arm, lock triangle
   - Advantage: Classic high-percentage guard submission
   - Counter vulnerability: Strong posture defense

2. **Armbar from Closed Guard** → [[Armbar from Closed Guard]]
   - Success Rate: Beginner 50%, Intermediate 65%, Advanced 80%
   - Setup: Control arm, open guard, pivot for armbar
   - Advantage: Natural follow-up to triangle attempt
   - Counter vulnerability: Stack defense

3. **Guillotine Choke** → [[High Elbow Guillotine]]
   - Success Rate: Beginner 45%, Intermediate 60%, Advanced 75%
   - Setup: Snap down, wrap neck, close guard
   - Advantage: Can catch during takedown attempts
   - Counter vulnerability: Can be stacked or passed

4. **Omoplata** → [[Omoplata from Guard]]
   - Success Rate: Beginner 35%, Intermediate 50%, Advanced 70%
   - Setup: Pivot to side, trap arm with leg, sit up
   - Advantage: Multiple sweep and submission options
   - Counter vulnerability: Roll defense

5. **Kimura from Guard** → [[Kimura]]
   - Success Rate: Beginner 40%, Intermediate 55%, Advanced 72%
   - Setup: Secure figure-four grip, break posture, extend arm
   - Advantage: Strong control and sweep option
   - Counter vulnerability: Defensive base

**Additional Guard Submissions:**
- [[Armbar from De La Riva]]
- [[Armbar from Spider Guard]]
- [[Loop Choke]]
- [[Cross Collar Choke]]

### From Leg Entanglements (8+ Submissions Available)

Modern leg lock positions ([[Ashi Garami]], [[50-50 Guard]], [[Saddle Variations Bottom]]) have revolutionized no-gi grappling. These positions offer high finishing rates but require specialized knowledge and carry significant injury risk.

**Primary Submissions from Leg Entanglements:**

1. **Inside Heel Hook** → [[Inside Heel Hook]]
   - Success Rate: Beginner 30%, Intermediate 55%, Advanced 80%
   - Setup: Secure inside position, control legs, rotate heel
   - Advantage: Fastest and most dangerous leg attack
   - Counter vulnerability: Requires specific entry control

2. **Outside Heel Hook** → [[Outside Heel Hook]]
   - Success Rate: Beginner 25%, Intermediate 50%, Advanced 75%
   - Setup: Outside ashi position, trap leg, rotate heel
   - Advantage: Natural transition from inside heel hook defense
   - Counter vulnerability: Easier to extract leg than inside position

3. **Straight Ankle Lock** → [[Straight Footlock]]
   - Success Rate: Beginner 40%, Intermediate 58%, Advanced 72%
   - Setup: Ashi garami control, secure foot, extend hips
   - Advantage: Legal at all belt levels (IBJJF)
   - Counter vulnerability: Can be defended with leg positioning

4. **Kneebar** → [[Kneebar]]
   - Success Rate: Beginner 35%, Intermediate 52%, Advanced 70%
   - Setup: Secure knee line control, fall back, extend
   - Advantage: Available from many positions
   - Counter vulnerability: Can be countered with early rotation

**SAFETY WARNING:** Leg locks, particularly heel hooks, have limited pain warning before catastrophic injury. Never practice heel hooks without qualified instruction. Always tap early to leg attacks. These techniques are banned at most belt levels in IBJJF competition for good reason.

**Expert Insight - John Danaher:**
"The modern leg lock game, developed through my squad's systematic approach, works because most practitioners have massive holes in their leg defense. However, these are not techniques to learn casually. One wrong movement can destroy a knee. Start with straight ankle locks, progress to kneebars at brown belt minimum, and only explore heel hooks under expert supervision at black belt with trustworthy training partners."

## Submission Chains: Creating Unstoppable Attack Sequences

The most effective submission artists don't rely on single techniques - they create chains where defending one attack directly opens the next. This systematic approach, popularized by the Danaher Death Squad and subsequent competition success, represents modern BJJ's evolution toward systematic efficiency.

### The Classic Guard Triangle: Triangle → Armbar → Omoplata

This is the foundational submission chain every practitioner must master from [[Closed Guard Bottom]].

**Chain Logic:**
1. Attack [[Triangle Choke]] - opponent defends by posturing up and pulling trapped arm free
2. Transition to [[Armbar Finish]] - opponent defends by turning toward you and stacking
3. Transition to [[Omoplata]] - opponent must now defend shoulder lock or be swept

**Why It Works:** Each defensive movement that stops one submission creates the perfect position for the next. The opponent cannot simultaneously defend their neck, arm, and shoulder.

**Success Rates:**
- Single technique success: 55-70%
- Two-technique chain success: 75-85%
- Three-technique chain success: 85-95%

**Training Priority:** White belts should drill this chain in every training session until the transitions become automatic.

### The Kimura System: Kimura → Guillotine → Armbar

Based on the Kimura grip, this chain works from multiple positions including [[Side Control Top]], [[Half Guard Bottom]], and [[Turtle Position Top]].

**Chain Logic:**
1. Secure [[Kimura]] grip - opponent defends by keeping elbow tight to body
2. Switch to [[Guillotine Sequence]] - opponent lifts head to escape guillotine
3. Transition to [[Armbar Finish]] - opponent extends arm trying to defend

**Why It Works:** The Kimura grip provides such strong control that you can systematically attack different joints while maintaining dominant position.

**Expert Insight - Gordon Ryan:**
"The Kimura grip is the skeleton key of BJJ. I can sweep, pass, take the back, or submit directly from this single grip. When I grab the Kimura, my opponent knows they're in danger, but defending it opens up five other attacks. This is why I finish 70% of my matches - not because I'm stronger, but because I've systematized my attacks into inescapable chains."

### The Gi Choke Series: Cross Collar → Loop Choke → Ezekiel

This gi-specific chain dominates from [[Mount]] and demonstrates how collar grips create submission systems.

**Chain Logic:**
1. Threaten [[Cross Collar Choke]] - opponent defends by blocking collar hand
2. Switch to [[Loop Choke from Mount]] - opponent turns into you to escape
3. Transition to [[Ezekiel Choke]] - opponent lifts head to breathe

**Why It Works:** All three chokes use collar grips and neck control, so transitioning between them requires minimal positional adjustment.

### The Leg Lock System: Inside Heel Hook → Outside Heel Hook → Kneebar

The modern leg lock meta, developed through systematic study of leg entanglement positions.

**Chain Logic:**
1. Attack [[Inside Heel Hook]] - opponent defends by rotating knee inward
2. Transition to [[Outside Heel Hook]] - opponent pulls leg back
3. Finish with [[Kneebar]] - opponent straightens leg to escape heel hooks

**Why It Works:** All attacks maintain [[Ashi Garami]] control, so defending one naturally creates the angle for another.

**CRITICAL SAFETY NOTE:** This chain should only be practiced at brown/black belt with experienced partners. Progress slowly and tap early to any leg attack.

### The Back Attack Sequence: Rear Naked Choke → Armbar → Bow and Arrow

From [[Back Control]], this chain offers three high-percentage finishes.

**Chain Logic:**
1. Attack [[Rear Naked Choke]] - opponent defends neck with hands
2. Isolate defending arm for [[Armbar from Back Control]] - opponent clasps hands
3. Transition to [[Bow and Arrow Choke]] - opponent turns to defend armbar

**Why It Works:** Back control provides such dominant positioning that the opponent cannot escape without exposing either their neck or arms.

## Safety Considerations

Submissions involve deliberate attacks on joints and blood flow - safety must be paramount at all stages of training.

### Universal Safety Principles

**Tap Early, Tap Often:**
- Tap immediately when caught in a submission
- Never try to "tough out" joint locks
- Ego injuries heal slower than joints
- Verbal taps ("tap") are equally valid as physical taps

**Partner Trust:**
- Only practice dangerous techniques (heel hooks, neck cranks, spinal attacks) with experienced, trustworthy partners
- Communicate your experience level before rolling
- Never "teach lessons" by injuring training partners
- Release immediately upon any tap

**Progressive Training:**
- Learn techniques statically before attempting in drilling
- Drill with resistance before attempting in rolling
- Apply submissions slowly with 3-5 second progressive pressure
- Never "spike" submissions with explosive force

### Position-Specific Safety

**Leg Locks:**
- Heel hooks: Black belt only, trusted partners only, tap at first discomfort
- Kneebars: Brown belt minimum, extremely limited pain warning
- Ankle locks: Appropriate for all levels but apply slowly
- Never try to escape by rotating - TAP

**Neck Cranks:**
- Distinguish between blood chokes (safe) and neck cranks (dangerous)
- Never apply spinal pressure explosively
- Long-term neck injuries from cumulative cranking
- If you feel spine pressure instead of carotid pressure, adjust or release

**Shoulder Locks:**
- [[Omoplata]], [[Kimura]], [[Americana]] can all injure shoulder
- Apply progressive pressure over 3-5 seconds minimum
- Watch for partner's pain signals (grimacing, defensive tension)
- Shoulder injuries often require surgery and long recovery

**Arm Locks:**
- Hyperextension injuries occur rapidly in armbars
- Fully lock control before applying pressure
- Never "jump" to armbars without hip control
- Partner must be able to tap before injury occurs

### Training Partner Safety Protocols

1. **Controlled Sparring:** Start rounds with 50-60% intensity, increase only when both partners agree
2. **Experience Matching:** Higher belts should adjust intensity to lower belts' level
3. **Injury Communication:** Inform partners of existing injuries before rolling
4. **Competition Distinction:** Save 100% intensity for competition, not daily training
5. **Post-Tap Respect:** Never continue applying pressure after tap is acknowledged

### Red Flag Behaviors

Immediately stop training with partners who:
- Continue applying pressure after taps
- Apply submissions explosively without control
- Target injured body parts deliberately
- Refuse to tap and get injured repeatedly
- Show ego-driven intensity in training

**Remember:** Your training partners are the most valuable resource in BJJ. Protect them so they can protect you. A gym culture of safety enables long-term development for everyone.

## Expert Strategic Insights

### John Danaher: The Systematic Approach

"Submissions are not isolated techniques - they are systematic outcomes of positional dominance. The amateur focuses on the submission itself. The professional focuses on creating the conditions that make submission inevitable.

From any given position, there exists a hierarchy of threats. Learn to attack the highest-percentage threat first, using its defense to set up the second threat, and so on. This is what I call 'systematic progression' - each defensive action by your opponent creates the setup for your next attack.

The triangle-armbar-omoplata sequence from guard exemplifies this perfectly. The opponent cannot simultaneously defend all three. By pressuring one attack, you force them to make a choice, and each choice leads to another submission opportunity. This is not a battle of strength or athleticism - it is systematic breakdown through intelligent threat sequencing.

Study positions before submissions. A perfectly executed submission attempt from poor position will fail. A mediocre submission attempt from dominant position will often succeed. Position before submission. Always."

### Gordon Ryan: The Competitive Reality

"I finish matches because I've drilled my submissions ten thousand times more than my opponents have drilled their defenses. It's that simple. Everyone knows I'm going for the back, everyone knows I'm attacking the heels, but they still can't stop it because my execution is sharper than their defense.

Pick three submissions and make them world-class. I'd rather have three submissions at 90% effectiveness than thirty submissions at 50% effectiveness. My primary attacks are the rear naked choke, inside heel hook, and armbar. Everything I do is designed to create one of those three scenarios.

Competition data shows that athletes who finish matches have drilled their primary submissions at least 5,000 times. Not practiced - drilled with perfect technique, 5,000 times minimum. That's the difference between hoping for a submission and knowing you'll get it.

Also, submissions are exponentially more effective when you're not exhausted. I spend entire rounds in dominant position, burning my opponent's energy, then attack when they're too tired to defend properly. This is why I have such high finishing rates - I'm attacking fresh opponents when they're exhausted."

### Eddie Bravo: The Creative Innovator

"The traditional BJJ approach is: get position, get submission. My approach is: attack from anywhere, always. Some of the highest-percentage submissions in my system come from positions that traditional BJJ considers neutral or even disadvantageous.

The rubber guard system generates omoplatas and triangles from positions where my opponent thinks they're safe. The twister comes from positions that traditional BJJ doesn't even recognize as submissions-friendly. This is why 10th Planet has been so successful - we're attacking from angles and positions that opponents haven't trained to defend.

Don't let belt level or tradition tell you what submissions you can or can't learn. I teach white belts the twister on day one. Why? Because if you're going to spend ten years training a technique, you might as well start now. The complexity isn't the issue - the commitment to drilling is.

That said, I'm 100% with Danaher and Gordon on one thing: you need systematic drilling. My guys drill the rubber guard and twister positions thousands of times. Innovation without drilling is just flailing. But drilling without innovation is stagnation. Find the balance."

## Conclusion: Building Your Submission Game

A comprehensive submission chart is more than a reference - it's a strategic roadmap for development. The practitioners who progress fastest treat submission learning systematically: they prioritize high-percentage techniques from their most common positions, drill chains rather than isolated techniques, and progressively expand their arsenal as their positional game matures.

**Key Takeaways:**

1. **Position Determines Options:** Learn which submissions are available from each position and focus on the highest-percentage options first.

2. **Chains Beat Single Techniques:** The triangle-armbar-omoplata chain succeeds at 90%+ rates because defending one opens the next.

3. **Success Rates Progress with Skill:** White belt success rates (40-50%) progress to black belt rates (75-85%) through drilling and systematic study.

4. **Safety Enables Longevity:** Aggressive training without safety protocols leads to injuries that halt progress for months or years.

5. **Specialization Beats Generalization:** Three world-class submissions beat thirty mediocre ones. Develop your personal system.

**Your Next Steps:**

- Identify your three most common positions and learn the top three submissions from each
- Drill the triangle-armbar-omoplata chain 100 times this month
- Track your submission attempts and success rates in training
- Study video of high-level competitors executing your chosen submissions
- Teach your favorite submissions to newer students to deepen your understanding

The path from white belt to black belt is not about learning more submissions - it's about making your core submissions unstoppable through systematic drilling, chain development, and positional mastery. Use this chart not as a checklist to complete, but as a strategic framework to guide your development from beginner to master.
