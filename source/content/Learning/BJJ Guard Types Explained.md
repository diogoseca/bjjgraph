# BJJ Guard Types Explained: Complete Guide to All Guards

The guard is the defining position of Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu - the art of fighting effectively from your back. Unlike most martial arts that consider the bottom position disadvantageous, BJJ has developed dozens of sophisticated guard positions where the bottom player can control, sweep, and submit their opponent.

This comprehensive guide explains every major guard type, when to use each position, and how guards fit into your overall BJJ game.

## What is Guard in BJJ?

**Guard** is any bottom position in BJJ where you use your legs to control your opponent, preventing them from establishing a dominant top position while creating opportunities for sweeps (reversals) and submissions.

### Core Guard Principles

1. **Hip Mobility** - Active hip movement prevents opponent's passing
2. **Distance Management** - Control space between you and opponent
3. **Off-balancing** - Disrupt opponent's balance and posture
4. **Frame Creation** - Use legs and arms to create defensive structure
5. **Grip Fighting** - Control opponent's grips and establish your own

### Guard vs. Bad Positions

**Guard positions** (you have control):
- Your legs actively control opponent
- You can sweep or submit
- Points: 0 (neutral position)

**Bad bottom positions** (opponent controls you):
- Opponent has passed your legs
- Side control, mount, back control
- Points: Opponent scores 3-4 points

**The goal**: Maintain guard to prevent the pass, then sweep to top position or submit from bottom.

---

## Guard Classification System

Guards are organized into four main families based on leg connection and control mechanisms:

### Family 1: Closed Guards
**Definition**: Legs wrapped around opponent (ankles locked or connected)

**Characteristics**:
- Maximum hip control
- Simplified distance management
- Best for beginners
- Limited mobility

**Examples**: [[Closed Guard Bottom]], [[Rubber Guard]], [[Williams Guard]]

### Family 2: Open Guards
**Definition**: Legs not connected, using hooks and frames for distance control

**Characteristics**:
- Dynamic movement
- Multiple connection points (hooks, grips, frames)
- Distance-based control
- Requires better timing

**Examples**: [[Spider Guard]], [[De La Riva Guard]], [[Butterfly Guard]], [[Lasso Guard]]

### Family 3: Half Guards
**Definition**: One of opponent's legs trapped between yours

**Characteristics**:
- Defensive recovery position
- Most common in competition (65% of matches)
- Strong sweeping potential
- Limited submission options (compared to full guard)

**Examples**: [[Half Guard Bottom]], [[Knee Shield Half Guard]], [[Lockdown Guard]], [[Deep Half Guard]]

### Family 4: Leg Entanglement Guards
**Definition**: Focus on controlling opponent's legs for sweeps and leg attacks

**Characteristics**:
- Modern competition meta
- No-gi dominance
- Leg lock offense/defense
- Requires systematic understanding

**Examples**: [[X-Guard]], [[Single Leg X Guard]], [[50-50 Guard]], [[Ashi Garami]]

---

## Closed Guard Family

### Closed Guard Bottom
**[[Closed Guard Bottom]]** - The fundamental guard

**Mechanics**: Legs wrapped around opponent's waist, ankles locked behind their back

**When to Use**:
- Beginning BJJ training
- Against larger/stronger opponents
- When you need maximum control
- In self-defense scenarios

**Success Rates**:
- Position Retention: Beginner 60%, Intermediate 70%, Advanced 80%
- Sweep Success: Beginner 40%, Intermediate 55%, Advanced 70%
- Submission Success: Beginner 30%, Intermediate 45%, Advanced 60%

**Primary Attacks**:
- [[Triangle Choke Front]] - Legs around neck and arm (Success: Beginner 35%, Intermediate 50%, Advanced 70%)
- [[Armbar Control]] - Classic arm hyperextension (Success: Beginner 40%, Intermediate 55%, Advanced 75%)
- [[Omoplata]] - Leg-based shoulder lock (Success: Beginner 25%, Intermediate 45%, Advanced 65%)
- [[Kimura]] - Figure-four shoulder lock (Success: Beginner 35%, Intermediate 50%, Advanced 70%)
- [[Cross Collar Choke]] - Gi choke using collars (Success: Beginner 40%, Intermediate 55%, Advanced 70%)

**Primary Sweeps**:
- Hip Bump Sweep - Off-balance forward (Success: Beginner 50%, Intermediate 70%, Advanced 85%)
- Scissor Sweep - Cut across base (Success: Beginner 45%, Intermediate 65%, Advanced 80%)
- Pendulum Sweep - Circular sweeping motion (Success: Beginner 40%, Intermediate 60%, Advanced 75%)

**Strengths**:
- Maximum hip control
- Simple to learn and maintain
- Multiple submission options
- Works well for self-defense

**Weaknesses**:
- Static position (limited movement)
- Difficult against good posture
- Energy-intensive to maintain
- Opponent can stack and pressure

**Expert Insight - John Danaher**: "Closed guard is the foundation of all guard work. The ability to control someone's posture while they're trapped between your legs develops the fundamental understanding of distance management, hip mobility, and timing that applies to every other guard position."

**Expert Insight - Gordon Ryan**: "I rarely use closed guard in competition anymore because modern guard passing has evolved to counter it, but every sweep and submission I do from open guard is based on principles I learned in closed guard first."

**Expert Insight - Eddie Bravo**: "Closed guard is where I developed the entire rubber guard system. Most people think closed guard is limited, but it's only limited if you keep your legs at your opponent's waist. When you start breaking them down and getting angles, closed guard becomes an offensive powerhouse."

---

### Rubber Guard System
**[[Rubber Guard]]** - Eddie Bravo's innovative closed guard variation

**Mechanics**: Closed guard with one leg hooked over opponent's shoulder and behind their head, using flexibility to break posture and control

**When to Use**:
- Flexible practitioners
- No-gi competition
- Against opponents with strong posture
- MMA applications (ground and pound defense)

**Success Rates**:
- Position Control: Beginner 30%, Intermediate 50%, Advanced 70%
- Submission Success: Beginner 20%, Intermediate 40%, Advanced 60%

**Primary Attacks**:
- [[Gogoplata Control]] - Shin across throat
- [[Omoplata]] - Enhanced setup from rubber guard
- [[Triangle Choke Front]] - From rubber guard position
- [[Williams Shoulder Lock]] - Rubber guard specialty

**Physical Requirements**:
- High flexibility (especially hip flexibility)
- Strong leg control
- Good grip endurance
- Understanding of 10th Planet system

**Expert Insight - Eddie Bravo**: "Rubber guard completely changed the game because it gave guys with flexibility a way to break posture that strong guys couldn't defend with strength alone. It's not about being a contortionist - it's about using your flexibility strategically."

---

### Williams Guard
**[[Williams Guard]]** - Deep closed guard variation

**Mechanics**: Ultra-high closed guard with legs wrapped around opponent's shoulders/upper back instead of waist

**When to Use**:
- When opponent stands in closed guard
- Against very tall opponents
- Advanced position recovery

**Success Rates**:
- Position Maintenance: Beginner 25%, Intermediate 45%, Advanced 65%
- Williams Shoulder Lock: Beginner 20%, Intermediate 40%, Advanced 60%

**Primary Attacks**:
- [[Williams Shoulder Lock]] - Signature submission
- [[Triangle Choke Front]] - From high position
- Back take opportunities

---

## Open Guard Family

Open guards are where BJJ becomes truly dynamic. Instead of locking your legs, you use hooks (feet behind opponent's legs/arms), grips (on gi, wrists, or limbs), and frames (arms/legs creating distance) to control space and create attacking opportunities.

### Spider Guard
**[[Spider Guard]]** - Gi-based distance control guard

**Mechanics**: Both feet on opponent's biceps, controlling sleeves, extending legs to create distance

**When to Use**:
- Gi competition
- Long legs (leverage advantage)
- Against pressure passers
- When opponent has strong base

**Success Rates**:
- Position Retention: Beginner 45%, Intermediate 65%, Advanced 80%
- Sweep Success: Beginner 35%, Intermediate 50%, Advanced 70%
- Submission Success: Beginner 20%, Intermediate 35%, Advanced 55%

**Primary Attacks**:
- [[Triangle Choke Front]] - From spider control
- [[Omoplata]] - Extended arm setup
- Spider sweep variations
- [[Armbar Control]] - Extension armbars

**Strengths**:
- Excellent distance control
- Difficult to pass (extended legs)
- Multiple sweep options
- Strong against pressure

**Weaknesses**:
- Requires strong grips (grip intensive)
- Leg flexibility needed
- Can be stacked/compressed
- No-gi ineffective

**Expert Insight - John Danaher**: "Spider guard revolutionized guard passing defense by making it impossible for the passer to get close to your hips without first breaking your grip control. It's a perfect example of using geometry - extending your legs creates angles that make passing mechanically inefficient."

---

### De La Riva Guard
**[[De La Riva Guard]]** - Hook-based open guard

**Mechanics**: Outside leg hooks around opponent's leg (de la riva hook), inside foot on hip, controlling opponent's far sleeve

**When to Use**:
- Gi and no-gi (modified)
- When opponent is standing or in combat base
- Against knee cut passes
- Setting up leg attacks (no-gi)

**Success Rates**:
- Position Retention: Beginner 40%, Intermediate 60%, Advanced 75%
- Sweep Success: Beginner 45%, Intermediate 60%, Advanced 80%

**Primary Attacks**:
- De La Riva sweep - Off-balance to side (Success: Beginner 50%, Intermediate 65%, Advanced 85%)
- Back take - From DLR to back (Success: Beginner 35%, Intermediate 55%, Advanced 75%)

- Berimbolo - Inverting to back (Advanced)

**Variations**:
- [[Reverse De La Riva Guard]] - Inside position
- Single sleeve DLR - One grip variation
- Combination DLR - Mixed with other guards

**Expert Insight - Gordon Ryan**: "De La Riva is still one of the most effective guards in modern competition because it directly attacks the opponent's base and posture. Every high-level competitor has a DLR game because it's so effective at creating off-balancing opportunities."

---

### Butterfly Guard
**[[Butterfly Guard]]** - Hook-based sweeping guard

**Mechanics**: Sitting up, both feet hooked inside opponent's thighs (butterfly hooks), controlling upper body with underhooks or overhooks

**When to Use**:
- Gi and no-gi (equally effective)
- When opponent is on knees or low
- Transition guard (connects to many positions)
- Against most passing styles

**Success Rates**:
- Position Retention: Beginner 50%, Intermediate 65%, Advanced 80%
- Sweep Success: Beginner 55%, Intermediate 70%, Advanced 85%

**Primary Attacks**:
- Butterfly sweep - Hook and lift (Success: Beginner 60%, Intermediate 75%, Advanced 90%)
- Arm drag - To back or side (Success: Beginner 50%, Intermediate 70%, Advanced 85%)
- [[Triangle Choke Front]] - From butterfly
- [[Guillotine Control]] - Front headlock entries

**Transitions**:
- [[X-Guard]] - Drop under for X
- [[Single Leg X Guard]] - Single leg control
- [[Half Guard Bottom]] - Recovery position
- [[Ashi Garami]] - Leg entanglement entry

**Strengths**:
- Extremely versatile
- Works gi and no-gi equally
- Strong sweeping potential
- Connects to many positions

**Weaknesses**:
- Requires good posture
- Vulnerable to stack passes
- Active/dynamic position (not passive)

**Expert Insight - John Danaher**: "Butterfly guard is the most versatile guard in jiu-jitsu because it naturally connects to nearly every other guard position. Master butterfly guard and you have access to the entire bottom game."

---

### Lasso Guard
**[[Lasso Guard]]** - Gi-based control using lasso grip

**Mechanics**: One leg threaded through opponent's arm (lasso), controlling sleeve and threading leg over shoulder

**When to Use**:
- Gi-only position
- Against strong pressure
- Tall/flexible practitioners
- Combined with spider or DLR

**Success Rates**:
- Position Control: Beginner 35%, Intermediate 55%, Advanced 75%
- Sweep Success: Beginner 40%, Intermediate 55%, Advanced 70%

**Primary Attacks**:
- Lasso sweep - Using threaded leg
- [[Triangle Choke Front]] - From lasso control
- [[Omoplata]] - Shoulder attack
- Back takes from lasso

**Expert Insight - Gordon Ryan**: "Lasso is one of those guards that's incredibly effective but also incredibly annoying to play against. When done right, it makes it almost impossible for the passer to do anything without first dealing with that lasso control."

---

### Collar Sleeve Guard
**[[Collar Sleeve Guard Bottom]]** - Classic gi guard

**Mechanics**: One hand controlling opponent's collar, other hand controlling sleeve, feet on hips/biceps for distance

**When to Use**:
- Gi fundamentals
- Beginner to intermediate
- Setting up sweeps and submissions
- Distance management

**Success Rates**:
- Position Control: Beginner 50%, Intermediate 65%, Advanced 75%
- Attack Success: Beginner 35%, Intermediate 50%, Advanced 65%

---

### Shin-to-Shin Guard
**[[Shin-to-Shin Guard]]** - Technical standing guard

**When to Use**:
- Advanced competition
- Berimbolo entries
- Recovery from bad positions
- Modern sport BJJ

**Physical Requirements**:

**When to Use**:
- Modern sport BJJ
- Creative guard players
- Against specific passing styles

---

### Seated Guard
**[[Seated Guard Bottom]]** - Basic seated posture

**Mechanics**: Sitting up, using frames and grips to prevent opponent's advance

**When to Use**:
- Foundational position
- Transitioning between guards
- Conservative guard retention

---

## Half Guard Family

Half guard is the most common position in BJJ competition - appearing in over 65% of matches. It's the ultimate recovery position when you're losing full guard, but it's also a powerful offensive guard with numerous sweeps and submission opportunities.

### Half Guard Bottom (Standard)
**[[Half Guard Bottom]]** - Core half guard position

**Mechanics**: Bottom position with one of opponent's legs trapped between yours

**When to Use**:
- Guard recovery (when opponent is passing)
- Against all skill levels
- Gi and no-gi (equally effective)
- Most common competition position

**Success Rates**:
- Position Retention: Beginner 55%, Intermediate 70%, Advanced 85%
- Sweep Success: Beginner 40%, Intermediate 60%, Advanced 75%
- Submission Success: Beginner 20%, Intermediate 35%, Advanced 50%

**Primary Attacks**:
- Sweep to top position (Success: Beginner 45%, Intermediate 60%, Advanced 80%)
- [[Kimura]] - Figure-four from bottom (Success: Beginner 35%, Intermediate 50%, Advanced 70%)
- Back take - Transition to back control (Success: Beginner 30%, Intermediate 50%, Advanced 70%)
- [[Guillotine Control]] - Front choke opportunities

**Variations**:
- [[Knee Shield Half Guard]] - Frame with knee shield
- [[Lockdown Guard]] - Eddie Bravo's lockdown system
- [[Deep Half Guard]] - Get deep under opponent
- [[Reverse Half Guard Bottom]] - Opposite leg trapped
- [[Z-Guard Bottom]] - Knee shield variation

**Strengths**:
- Extremely common (must know this position)
- Strong recovery position
- Good sweeping potential
- Works against all body types

**Weaknesses**:
- Can be pressure-heavy (opponent smash)
- Limited submission options (compared to full guard)
- Requires good framing
- Opponent can consolidate pass

**Expert Insight - John Danaher**: "Half guard is not a goal position - it's a transitional position. Your objective should always be to either recover full guard or immediately sweep to top position. Staying in half guard too long allows your opponent to consolidate and pass."

**Expert Insight - Gordon Ryan**: "I probably spend more time in half guard than any other position during a match. It's where everyone ends up when they're defending passes, so if you master half guard, you essentially become un-passable."

---

### Knee Shield Half Guard
**[[Knee Shield Half Guard]]** - Defensive half guard with frame

**Mechanics**: Half guard with top leg framing across opponent's chest (knee shield)

**When to Use**:
- Against heavy pressure
- Creating distance in half guard
- Preventing opponent's crossface
- Transitioning to other guards

**Success Rates**:
- Defense Effectiveness: Beginner 60%, Intermediate 75%, Advanced 85%
- Sweep Opportunities: Beginner 45%, Intermediate 60%, Advanced 75%

**Primary Attacks**:
- Knee shield sweep - Push and off-balance
- [[Kimura]] - From knee shield frame
- Back take - Using knee shield distance
- Transition to butterfly hooks

**Expert Insight - Gordon Ryan**: "Knee shield is my primary defensive frame in half guard. It prevents the opponent from getting close enough to consolidate side control while giving me the distance I need to set up sweeps and back takes."

---

### Lockdown Guard
**[[Lockdown Guard]]** - 10th Planet half guard system

**Mechanics**: Half guard with legs figure-foured around trapped leg (lockdown), controlling opponent's mobility

**When to Use**:
- No-gi competition
- Against strong opponents (neutralizes strength)
- Setting up electric chair submission
- Preventing opponent's pass

**Success Rates**:
- Position Control: Beginner 50%, Intermediate 65%, Advanced 80%
- Electric Chair Success: Beginner 25%, Intermediate 45%, Advanced 65%

**Primary Attacks**:
- [[Electric Chair Submission]] - Lockdown leg attack
- Old school sweep - Roll over shoulder
- [[Twister Setup]] - To truck position
- Vaporizer sweep

**Expert Insight - Eddie Bravo**: "The lockdown revolutionized half guard by giving smaller guys a way to control bigger, stronger opponents. When you lockdown their leg, all their pressure and strength becomes irrelevant because they can't move."

---

### Deep Half Guard
**[[Deep Half Guard]]** - Advanced half guard variation

**Mechanics**: Getting deep under opponent, controlling their near leg, with your head on backside

**When to Use**:
- Advanced sweep setups
- Against skilled opponents
- Competition scenarios
- When standard half guard is shut down

- Waiter sweep - Technical sweep
- Back take - From deep position

**Expert Insight - John Danaher**: "Deep half guard is one of the most effective sweeping positions in all of jiu-jitsu when done correctly. You're attacking your opponent's base from underneath where they have minimal defensive options."

---

### Z-Guard
**[[Z-Guard Bottom]]** - Modified knee shield position

**Mechanics**: Knee shield with specific shin positioning and grips

**When to Use**:
- Modern sport BJJ
- Technical half guard play
- Against leg drag passes

---

### Reverse Half Guard

**Mechanics**: Opposite leg trapped (compared to standard half guard)

**When to Use**:
- Specific passing counters
- Transition position
- Advanced guard retention

### Quarter Guard
**[[Quarter Guard Bottom]]** - Minimal half guard control

**Mechanics**: Barely trapping opponent's leg (ankle/foot control only)

**When to Use**:
- Last-ditch guard recovery
- Preventing final pass
- Quick re-guard attempts

---

## Modern Leg Entanglement Guards

These guards focus on controlling opponent's legs, creating sweeps and leg lock attacks. They dominate modern no-gi BJJ and are increasingly important in gi competition.

### X-Guard
**[[X-Guard]]** - Crossed legs under opponent

**Mechanics**: Both legs crossed in "X" formation under opponent, controlling both their legs

**When to Use**:
- When opponent is standing or high posture
- Setting up powerful sweeps
- Both gi and no-gi
- Against larger opponents

**Success Rates**:
- Entry Success: Beginner 35%, Intermediate 55%, Advanced 75%
- Sweep Success: Beginner 60%, Intermediate 75%, Advanced 90%

**Primary Attacks**:
- X-Guard sweep - Direct forward sweep (Success: Beginner 65%, Intermediate 80%, Advanced 95%)
- Technical stand-up - Stand while controlling
- [[Single Leg X Guard]] - Transition to SLX
- Back take - From X-Guard control

**Strengths**:
- Extremely powerful sweeps
- Off-balances opponent dramatically
- Works against larger opponents
- Natural leg attack entry (no-gi)

**Weaknesses**:
- Requires timing and precision
- Opponent can step out
- Commitment required
- Less submission options (primarily sweep-focused)

**Expert Insight - Gordon Ryan**: "X-Guard is still one of the highest percentage sweeps in no-gi because you're attacking both of the opponent's legs simultaneously. They literally have nothing to base on when X-Guard is locked in properly."

---

### Single Leg X Guard
**[[Single Leg X Guard]]** - Single leg control variant

**Mechanics**: Controlling one of opponent's legs with your legs, other leg free for balance

**When to Use**:
- No-gi competition
- Leg lock entries

- Against pressure passers

**Success Rates**:
- Position Control: Beginner 40%, Intermediate 60%, Advanced 80%
- Sweep Success: Beginner 50%, Intermediate 70%, Advanced 85%
- Leg Attack Entry: Beginner 30%, Intermediate 55%, Advanced 80%

**Primary Attacks**:
- Technical stand-up sweep
- [[Ashi Garami]] - Leg entanglement entry
- [[Kneebar Control]] - Knee attack
- Back take opportunities

**Expert Insight - John Danaher**: "Single Leg X is the foundation of the entire modern leg lock game. From this position, you have simultaneous threats of sweeps, back takes, and leg attacks, creating true dilemmas for your opponent."

---

### 50-50 Guard
**[[50-50 Guard Bottom]]** - Symmetrical leg entanglement

**Mechanics**: Both you and opponent's legs entangled symmetrically, equal control

**When to Use**:
- No-gi competition (primarily)

- [[Straight Ankle Lock]] - Secondary attack
- Sweep opportunities from 50-50
- Technical standup

**Controversy**: Often criticized for stalling in competition

**Expert Insight - Gordon Ryan**: "50-50 is misunderstood. People think it's a stalling position, but if you actually understand leg locks, 50-50 is a constant battle where both people are attacking and defending simultaneously. It's like a chess match with your legs."

---

## Guard Selection Strategy

Choosing the right guard depends on multiple factors:

### By Opponent's Style

**Against Pressure Passers** (heavy, smash passing):
- **Best Guards**: [[Knee Shield Half Guard]], [[Spider Guard]], [[Lasso Guard Bottom]]
- **Why**: These guards create distance and frames that neutralize pressure
- **Avoid**: Tight guards where they can consolidate (closed guard can be pressured)

**Against Speed Passers** (fast, standing passes):
- **Best Guards**: [[De La Riva Guard]], [[X-Guard]], [[Single Leg X Guard]]
- **Why**: Hook-based guards off-balance mobile opponents
- **Avoid**: Static guards (closed guard) where they can create distance

**Against Leg Drag Specialists**:
- **Best Guards**: [[De La Riva Guard]], [[Reverse De La Riva Guard]], [[Shin-to-Shin Guard]]
- **Why**: These guards specifically counter leg drag mechanics
- **Avoid**: Positions that expose your back

**Against Knee Cut Passers**:
- **Best Guards**: [[De La Riva Guard]], [[Butterfly Guard]], [[Half Guard Bottom]]
- **Why**: Direct counters to knee cut mechanics
- **Avoid**: Positions without leg connection

---

### By Your Body Type

**Long Legs (Tall/Lanky Build)**:
- **Best Guards**: [[Spider Guard]], [[De La Riva Guard]], [[Lasso Guard Bottom]]
- **Why**: Length creates maximum distance and control
- **Focus**: Distance management, extension-based attacks

**Short Legs (Stocky Build)**:
- **Best Guards**: [[Butterfly Guard]], [[Half Guard Bottom]], [[Deep Half Guard]]
- **Why**: Compact guards use leverage over length
- **Focus**: Close-range control, technical sweeps

**Flexible (High Hip Mobility)**:
- **Best Guards**: [[Rubber Guard]], [[Inverted Guard]], [[Z-Guard Bottom]]
- **Why**: Take advantage of unique flexibility
- **Focus**: Positions others can't achieve

**Strong Grip (Powerful Hands)**:
- **Best Guards**: [[Spider Guard]], [[Lasso Guard Bottom]], [[Collar Sleeve Guard Bottom]]
- **Why**: Grip-intensive guards maximize advantage
- **Focus**: Gi-based controls

---

## Guard Retention Fundamentals

Regardless of which guard you choose, these principles maintain any guard:

### Core Retention Concepts

1. **Hip Movement** - Shrimp, invert, technical standup
2. **Active Legs** - Always moving, creating frames
3. **Connection Points** - Maintain at least 2 points of contact
4. **Distance Management** - Too close or appropriate distance, never middle
5. **Grip Fighting** - Deny opponent's grips, establish yours

### Common Mistakes

1. **Static Guard** - Not moving hips and legs actively
   - Fix: Constant micro-adjustments, never fully settled

2. **Grabbing Own Legs** - Defensive pulling knees to chest
   - Fix: Extend legs into opponent, create frames

3. **Single Connection** - Only one point of contact
   - Fix: Minimum 2 connection points always

4. **Wrong Distance** - Stuck in middle range
   - Fix: Fully extended or tight control, avoid middle

5. **Passive Grips** - Letting opponent control grips
   - Fix: Active grip fighting, establish controls first

## Expert Guard Philosophies

### John Danaher: Systematic Guard Approach

**Philosophy**: "Every guard position should create a systematic network of attacks where the opponent's defensive reaction to one technique opens the next attack."

**Key Principles**:
- Position precedes submission
- Create inescapable dilemmas
- Technical precision over athleticism
- Systematic transitions between guards

**Recommended Guards**: [[Closed Guard Bottom]], [[Half Guard Bottom]], [[Ashi Garami]], [[Single Leg X Guard]]

---

### Gordon Ryan: Competition-Tested Guards

**Philosophy**: "I only use guards that have proven effective at the highest levels of competition. If it doesn't work on world-class opponents, I don't waste time on it."

**Key Principles**:
- High-percentage techniques only
- Guard as entry to leg locks or back control
- Dynamic guard passing/retention
- Gi and no-gi specialization

**Primary Guards**: [[Butterfly Guard]], [[Single Leg X Guard]], [[Half Guard Bottom]], [[De La Riva Guard]]

---

### Eddie Bravo: Creative Guard Innovation

**Philosophy**: "Traditional guards are limited by traditional thinking. Modern guards should use every available control - flexibility, creativity, and innovation."

**Key Principles**:
- Flexibility-based advantages
- Unorthodox positions
- Breaking posture completely
- MMA-applicable guards

**Signature Guards**: [[Rubber Guard]], [[Lockdown Guard]], [[Twister Control]]

---
