# BJJ Positions: The Complete Educational Guide

Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu is fundamentally a game of positions. Unlike striking martial arts that emphasize single devastating techniques, BJJ succeeds through systematic positional advancement—gradually improving your position while degrading your opponent's until submission becomes inevitable.

This complete guide teaches you the strategic framework behind all BJJ positions, how they connect, and how to build a cohesive game plan based on positional understanding. Whether you're a white belt learning your first positions or an advanced practitioner refining your strategy, this guide provides the conceptual foundation for mastering BJJ's positional chess game.

## Understanding Positional Hierarchy

The positional hierarchy in BJJ creates a measurable advantage system. Each position exists on a spectrum from severely disadvantaged (opponent on your back) to maximally advantageous (you on opponent's back with control).

### The Hierarchy Pyramid

**Level 4: Maximum Dominance (4 Points)**
- [[Mount]] - Superior position with weight control and submission access
- [[Back Control]] - Ultimate control position with opponent unable to defend effectively

**Level 3: Strong Control (3 Points)**
- [[Side Control]] - Pinning position with multiple advancement options
- [[Knee on Belly]] - Dynamic control with high submission threat

**Level 2: Positional Advancement (2 Points)**
- Guard passing positions (when pass is completed)
- Sweep positions (when guard player inverts top/bottom dynamic)

**Level 1: Neutral/Guard Positions (0 Points)**
- [[Closed Guard Bottom]] - Defensive with offensive opportunities
- [[Open Guard Bottom]] - Dynamic guard systems with variety
- [[Half Guard Bottom]] - Transitional guard with specialization options

**Level 0: Defensive/Disadvantaged**
- [[Bottom Turtle]] - Defensive shell protecting against back takes
- Being passed/controlled - Recovery positions

This hierarchy determines strategic objectives: always seek to move up the hierarchy (improvement) while preventing opponent advancement. Every position battle becomes a fight for hierarchical advantage.

### What Makes a Position "Dominant"?

A position's dominance is determined by five factors:

1. **Control Degree**: How many of opponent's movements can you restrict?
2. **Submission Accessibility**: How many high-percentage submissions are available?
3. **Escape Difficulty**: How hard is it for opponent to improve their situation?
4. **Energy Cost**: How much energy does maintaining position require?
5. **Advancement Options**: How many better positions can you transition to?

[[Mount]] scores highest because it restricts opponent movement, offers numerous submissions, requires significant effort to escape, costs moderate energy to maintain, and provides advancement to [[Back Control]].

[[Closed Guard Bottom]], while scoring 0 points, still provides control and submission options, making it superior to being passed despite neutral scoring.

---

## The Point Value System

Understanding the IBJJF (International Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu Federation) point system is crucial for competition strategy and conceptual understanding of position value.

### IBJJF Point Breakdown

**4 Points: Maximum Dominance Positions**
- [[Mount]] (established for 3 seconds)
- [[Back Control]] (with hooks established)
- Mount variations: [[High Mount]], [[S-Mount Position]], [[Technical Mount]]

**3 Points: Strong Control Positions**
- [[Side Control]] (established for 3 seconds)
- [[Knee on Belly]] (established for 3 seconds)
- [[North-South]] (less common for full points)

**2 Points: Positional Advancement**
- Guard pass completion (knees past legs, 3-second control)
- Sweep (reversing top/bottom position from guard)
- Takedown (establishing top position from standing)

**0 Points: Neutral/Defensive Positions**
- All guard positions ([[Closed Guard Bottom]], [[Open Guard Bottom]], etc.)
- [[Standing Position]] (neutral)
- Transitional positions

**Advantages: Near-Success Recognition**
- Near submission (forcing defensive reaction)
- Near sweep/pass (almost completing position change)
- Strategic positioning without full positional control

### Point Strategy Implications

The point system shapes strategic decision-making:

**Guard Players** must accept starting at 0 points but gain:
- First submission opportunities (attacks from guard)
- Sweep potential for 2-point reversal
- Defensive security before risking advancement

**Passers** must navigate 0-point guard to reach:
- 2 points for guard pass
- 3 points for side control establishment
- 4 points for mount advancement
- High-percentage submission access from top

**Match Strategy**: Point differences determine approach:
- Leading by 2+ points: Focus on position retention, run clock
- Tied or trailing: Aggressive advancement, submission hunting
- Final minutes: Point advantages become critical

This creates "decision dilemmas" (Craig Jones concept): opponent's defensive choices open different offensive opportunities, making every position a strategic puzzle.

## Dominant Positions: 4-Point Control

The 4-point positions represent maximum dominance in BJJ. From these positions, submission probability increases dramatically (50-60% for advanced practitioners) while escape probability drops significantly (25-35% for opponents).

### Mount: The Premier Top Position

[[Mount]] places you on opponent's torso with legs straddling their body, creating overwhelming pressure on their breathing and movement. The position scores 4 points because it provides:

**Strategic Advantages:**
- Weight directly on opponent's chest/diaphragm
- Both arms available for attacks while legs maintain position
- Multiple submission paths (chokes, armbars, shoulder locks)
- Advancement to [[Back Control]] if opponent turns

**Position Retention:** 75% for advanced practitioners (competition data)

**Key Control Principles:**
- Hips low, sinking weight into sternum
- Knees tight to ribs/armpits, eliminating space
- Head control through cross-collar grips or underhooks
- Constant pressure draining opponent energy

**Common Transitions:**
- [[High Mount]] - Chest-to-chest for submission pressure (Success Rate: Beginner 55%, Intermediate 70%, Advanced 85%)
- [[S-Mount Position]] - Modified mount for armbar attacks (Success Rate: Beginner 45%, Intermediate 60%, Advanced 75%)
- [[Technical Mount]] - When opponent turns, maintain control (Success Rate: Beginner 50%, Intermediate 65%, Advanced 80%)
- [[Back Control]] - Ultimate position if opponent fully turns (Success Rate: Beginner 40%, Intermediate 55%, Advanced 70%)

**Submission Options:**
- [[Cross Collar Choke]] (Success Rate: Beginner 35%, Intermediate 50%, Advanced 65%)
- [[Armbar from Mount]] (Success Rate: Beginner 30%, Intermediate 45%, Advanced 60%)
- [[Americana]] (Success Rate: Beginner 25%, Intermediate 40%, Advanced 55%)
- [[Triangle Control]] setup from mount (Success Rate: Beginner 20%, Intermediate 35%, Advanced 50%)

### Back Control: Ultimate Dominance

[[Back Control]] is considered the most dominant position in BJJ. Opponent cannot see you, has no defensive frames, and must defend blind while you control their back with both hooks and upper body control.

**Strategic Advantages:**
- Opponent cannot see your attacks
- Gravity works against their escape attempts
- Unlimited submission access to neck
- Energy drain from constant defensive requirements
- Very high submission rate (60%+ for advanced practitioners)

**Position Retention:** 80%+ for advanced practitioners

**Key Control Principles:**
- Both hooks in (feet inside opponent's thighs)
- Chest tight to opponent's back
- Head control or seat belt grip (one arm over shoulder, one under armpit)
- Constant adjustment to maintain hooks as opponent moves

**Primary Submission:**
- [[Rear Naked Choke]] (Success Rate: Beginner 40%, Intermediate 60%, Advanced 80%)
- Highest percentage submission in BJJ when properly applied
- Control hand protects choke hand, making defense extremely difficult

**Alternative Attacks:**
- [[Bow and Arrow Choke]] in gi (Success Rate: Beginner 30%, Intermediate 45%, Advanced 60%)
- [[Armbar from Back Control]] (Success Rate: Beginner 25%, Intermediate 40%, Advanced 55%)
- Back triangle variations (advanced techniques)

### Mount Variations: Specialized Control

**[[High Mount]]**: Advancing chest-to-chest for maximum submission pressure
- Restricts arm movement completely
- Sets up [[Ezekiel Choke]] and [[Americana]]
- Risk: Increased vulnerability to back roll if too high

**[[S-Mount Position]]**: One leg positioned for armbar
- 90% armbar success from proper S-mount setup
- Controls opponent's defensive frames
- Requires excellent balance and timing

**[[Technical Mount]]**: When opponent turns to side
- Maintains mount scoring while adjusting to defensive turn
- Natural progression to [[Back Control]]
- Prevents guard recovery during opponent's escape attempt

---

## Controlling Positions: 3-Point Control

The 3-point positions provide strong control with lower submission rates but excellent position retention and advancement options.

### Side Control: Fundamental Pinning Position

[[Side Control]] (also called side mount or cross-side) places you perpendicular across opponent's torso, using body weight and pressure to pin them flat while maintaining stable base.

**Position Retention:** 85% for advanced practitioners (highest retention rate among dominant positions)

**Strategic Advantages:**
- Stable platform for control and rest
- Multiple advancement paths (mount, north-south, knee on belly, back)
- Submission opportunities (chokes and shoulder locks)
- Difficult to sweep due to wide base
- Pressure exhausts opponent over time

**Key Control Principles:**
- Chest-to-chest connection eliminates space
- Crossface (shoulder pressure on jaw) restricts movement
- Underhook on near side controls shoulder
- Wide base with legs prevents destabilization
- Weight distributed through hips, not hands

**Common Transitions:**
- [[Mount]] transition (Success Rate: Beginner 50%, Intermediate 65%, Advanced 80%)
- [[Knee on Belly]] (Success Rate: Beginner 45%, Intermediate 60%, Advanced 75%)
- [[North-South]] (Success Rate: Beginner 55%, Intermediate 70%, Advanced 85%)
- [[Back Control]] via gift wrap (Success Rate: Beginner 35%, Intermediate 50%, Advanced 65%)

**Submission Options:**
- [[Kimura]] from side control (Success Rate: Beginner 30%, Intermediate 45%, Advanced 60%)
- [[Americana]] (Success Rate: Beginner 25%, Intermediate 40%, Advanced 55%)
- [[Paper Cutter Choke]] (Success Rate: Beginner 20%, Intermediate 35%, Advanced 50%)

### Knee on Belly: Dynamic Pressure Position

[[Knee on Belly]] is a dynamic 3-point position where your knee presses into opponent's diaphragm/sternum while maintaining mobile base. Less stable than [[Side Control]] but offers faster transitions and submissions.

**Strategic Advantages:**
- Extreme pressure on breathing
- Quick submission access
- Easy transition to mount or back
- Mobility allows pursuit of escaping opponent
- Forces immediate defensive response

**Key Control Principles:**
- Knee on sternum or solar plexus (not ribs)
- Shin across torso for surface area pressure
- Far leg posted for base
- Grips on collar/pants prevent bridging
- Weight through knee, creating focused pressure

**Submission Options:**
- [[Baseball Choke]] (Success Rate: Beginner 30%, Intermediate 45%, Advanced 60%)
- Quick [[Armbar]] entries (Success Rate: Beginner 25%, Intermediate 40%, Advanced 55%)
- Transition to [[Mount]] for sustained attack (Success Rate: Beginner 50%, Intermediate 65%, Advanced 80%)

**Risk Factor:** More vulnerable to guard recovery than [[Side Control]] due to reduced stability. Requires constant pressure and grip control.

### North-South: Head-to-Head Control

[[North-South]] positions you head-to-head with opponent while maintaining top pressure. Less common than [[Side Control]] but offers unique submission opportunities.

**Strategic Advantages:**
- Difficult escape angle for opponent
- Specialized choke opportunities
- Good position for heavy pressure
- Natural transition from side control

**Submission Options:**
- [[North-South Choke]] (Success Rate: Beginner 20%, Intermediate 35%, Advanced 50%)
- Kimura entries from north-south
- Return to [[Side Control]] or advance to [[Mount]]

---

## Guard Systems: The Bottom Game

Guard positions place you on bottom but give you control through leg positioning and grip strategies. While scoring 0 points, guards provide the foundation for sweeps and submissions that create point-scoring opportunities.

### Closed Guard: The Foundation

[[Closed Guard Bottom]] wraps your legs around opponent's waist with ankles crossed, creating a secure defensive position with offensive potential.

**Position Retention:** Beginner 60%, Intermediate 70%, Advanced 80%

**Strategic Framework:**
- **Defense First**: Closed guard protects against passing while you develop attacks
- **Posture Breaking**: All attacks require breaking opponent's upright posture
- **Multiple Threats**: Sweeps and submissions work together, one opens the other
- **Energy Management**: Opponent works harder to pass than you work to maintain

**Key Control Principles:**
- Ankles crossed tightly behind opponent's back
- Hips close to opponent, eliminating space
- Control opponent's posture through collar/sleeve grips
- Create angles by shifting hips left/right
- Constant threat prevents opponent from settling into comfortable passing position

**Primary Sweeps:**
- [[Hip Bump Sweep]] (Success Rate: Beginner 40%, Intermediate 55%, Advanced 70%)
- [[Scissor Sweep]] (Success Rate: Beginner 35%, Intermediate 50%, Advanced 65%)
- [[Pendulum Sweep]] (Success Rate: Beginner 30%, Intermediate 45%, Advanced 60%)

**Primary Submissions:**
- [[Triangle Choke]] (Success Rate: Beginner 25%, Intermediate 40%, Advanced 55%)
- [[Armbar]] from guard (Success Rate: Beginner 25%, Intermediate 40%, Advanced 55%)
- [[Cross Collar Choke]] (Success Rate: Beginner 30%, Intermediate 45%, Advanced 60%)
- [[Omoplata]] (Success Rate: Beginner 20%, Intermediate 35%, Advanced 50%)

### Open Guard Systems: Dynamic Control

When opponent stands or creates distance, [[Closed Guard Bottom]] opens to [[Open Guard Bottom]] - a diverse family of positions using hooks, grips, and frames to control opponent while maintaining attacking options.

**Open Guard Philosophy:**
- **Mobility**: Legs extend/retract to maintain distance control
- **Variety**: Dozens of specialized guards for different situations
- **Reaction-Based**: Choose guard based on opponent's passing strategy
- **Modern Meta**: Open guards dominate modern competition BJJ

**Major Open Guard Types:**

**[[Butterfly Guard]]**: Feet hooked under opponent's thighs
- Excellent elevation for sweeps
- Quick transition to [[X-Guard]] and [[Single Leg X Guard]]
- Works well against kneeling opponents
- Sweep Success: Beginner 35%, Intermediate 50%, Advanced 65%

**[[De La Riva Guard]]**: Outside leg hooks opponent's leg, inside leg controls
- Controls opponent's base and mobility
- Natural setup for back takes
- Dominant in gi competition
- Sweep/Back Take Success: Beginner 30%, Intermediate 45%, Advanced 60%

**[[Spider Guard]]**: Gripping opponent's sleeves with feet on biceps (gi only)
- Excellent distance control
- Prevents opponent from settling into passing position
- High energy cost for both players
- Sweep Success: Beginner 30%, Intermediate 45%, Advanced 60%

**[[X-Guard]]**: Legs crossed in X formation controlling opponent's leg
- Powerful elevation potential
- Leads to sweeps or transitions to other positions
- Requires mobility and timing
- Sweep Success: Beginner 25%, Intermediate 40%, Advanced 60%

**[[Lasso Guard]]**: Opponent's arm wrapped around your leg (gi only)
- Extreme arm control
- Difficult to pass
- Opens shoulder lock and sweep opportunities
- Position Retention: Beginner 55%, Intermediate 70%, Advanced 85%

### Half Guard: The Transitional System

[[Half Guard Bottom]] controls one opponent's leg with your legs while opponent has passed halfway. Considered inferior to full guard but provides specialized opportunities.

**Strategic Framework:**
- **Last Line of Defense**: Often reached when guard is partially passed
- **Specialization Opportunity**: Many practitioners build entire games around half guard
- **Back Take Access**: Natural progression to [[Back Control]]
- **Energy Efficient**: Less active movement than open guards

**Position Retention:** Beginner 50%, Intermediate 65%, Advanced 80%

**Half Guard Variations:**

**[[Deep Half Guard]]**: Under opponent's body, controlling their weight
- Powerful sweeping position
- Excellent against heavy pressure passers
- Requires comfort in uncomfortable positions
- Sweep Success: Beginner 30%, Intermediate 50%, Advanced 70%

**[[Knee Shield Half Guard]]** (also [[Z-Guard]]): Using knee as frame
- Creates distance for recovery to full guard
- Setup for sweeps and back takes
- Easier to learn than deep half
- Recovery Success: Beginner 40%, Intermediate 55%, Advanced 70%

**[[Lockdown Guard]]**: Figure-four lock on opponent's leg (10th Planet system)
- Extreme leg control
- Setup for [[Electric Chair]] submission
- Signature Eddie Bravo position
- Control Success: Beginner 35%, Intermediate 50%, Advanced 65%

### Specialty Guard Systems

**[[Rubber Guard]]**: High guard with overhook (Eddie Bravo system)
- Extreme posture control
- Setup for [[Gogoplata]] and [[Omoplata]]
- Requires flexibility
- Submission Success: Beginner 15%, Intermediate 30%, Advanced 50%

**[[Worm Guard]]**: Using lapel to control opponent (gi only, Keenan Cornelius innovation)
- Modern competition guard
- Complex system requiring extensive study
- Very difficult to pass once established

**[[Reverse De La Riva Guard]]**: Inside leg hooks opponent's leg
- Counter to certain passing styles
- Back take opportunities
- Less dominant than standard De La Riva

---

## Transitional and Scramble Positions

Not all positions are stable control states. Many positions exist briefly during transitions between stable positions. Understanding transitional states is crucial for capitalizing on opportunities.

### Turtle Position: Defensive Shell

[[Bottom Turtle]] (also [[Turtle Position]]) is a defensive position where you're on hands and knees protecting your back and preventing guard recovery.

**Strategic Purpose:**
- **Last Resort Defense**: Prevents immediate submission when guard passing is inevitable
- **Temporary State**: Goal is escape to guard or standing, not sustained defense
- **Risk Management**: Protects neck but risks back exposure

**Key Defensive Principles:**
- Elbows tight to knees, eliminating space
- Head tucked, protecting neck
- Weight on forearms, not hands
- Constant movement to prevent back take

**Escape Options:**
- [[Technical Stand-up]] (Success Rate: Beginner 30%, Intermediate 45%, Advanced 60%)
- [[Guard Recovery]] (Success Rate: Beginner 25%, Intermediate 40%, Advanced 55%)
- [[Granby Roll]] to guard (Success Rate: Beginner 20%, Intermediate 35%, Advanced 55%)

**Opponent's Attacks from Top Turtle:**
- [[Back Control]] establishment (Primary goal)
- [[Turtle Roll]] to [[Side Control]]
- [[Front Headlock]] position
- [[Crucifix Position]] advanced control

### Scramble Positions: Chaos Control

Scrambles occur when both practitioners are in transitional states simultaneously, creating dynamic, fast-paced position changes.

**Scramble Situations:**
- Failed guard pass with opponent recovering
- Failed sweep with both standing/kneeling
- Simultaneous submission escape and position change
- Stand-up transitions

**Scramble Strategy:**
- **Speed**: First to stable position wins
- **Base Priority**: Establish solid base before advancing
- **Risk Assessment**: Know when to accept neutral position vs. push advantage
- **Energy Burst**: Short, explosive movements

**Common Scramble Resolutions:**
- [[Dogfight Position]] - Both players on knees in half guard situation
- [[Standing Position]] - Both return to standing
- One player achieves [[Side Control]] or [[Mount]]
- Both players reset to guard position

### Standing Positions

**[[Standing Position]]**: Neutral standing where both players are upright
- Takedown opportunities
- Guard pull entries
- Energy recovery moment
- Reset between exchanges

**[[Clinch Position]]**: Standing grappling with body control
- Transitional between standing and ground
- Takedown setups
- Guard pull preparations

---

## Leg Entanglement Systems

Leg entanglement positions represent modern BJJ evolution, focusing on lower body control and leg attacks. This system gained prominence through John Danaher's systematic approach and Gordon Ryan's competitive dominance.

### Understanding Leg Entanglement Strategy

**Philosophy:**
- Legs are submission targets equal to arms
- Positional hierarchy exists within leg entanglements
- Heel hooks provide highest submission rate in modern no-gi
- System requires specialized training for safety

**Strategic Framework (Danaher System):**
1. **Outside Position** ([[Outside Ashi Garami]]): Controlling opponent's leg from outside
2. **Inside Position** ([[Ashi Garami]]): Standard leg entanglement
3. **50/50** ([[50-50 Guard]]): Symmetrical leg engagement
4. **Backside 50/50**: Inverted leg control
5. **Inside Sankaku** ([[Inside Sankaku]]): Dominant leg entanglement position
6. **Saddle/Honey Hole** ([[Saddle Position]]): Maximum control for leg attacks

### Primary Leg Entanglement Positions

## Strategic Frameworks and Game Plans

Every successful BJJ practitioner needs a position-based game plan that creates strategic coherence between positions.

### The Guard Player Framework

**Strategic Philosophy:** Start on bottom, sweep to top, advance to dominant positions, finish

**Position Progression:**
1. **Pull guard** to [[Closed Guard Bottom]] or [[Open Guard Bottom]]
2. **Break posture** and threaten submissions to create reactions
3. **Sweep** when opponent defends (40-70% success) to [[Mount]] or [[Side Control]]
4. **Maintain** top control (70-85% retention)
5. **Advance** to [[Back Control]] or [[Mount]]
6. **Submit** from dominant position (50-80% success)

**Guard Player Advantages:**
- First submission opportunities (bottom attacks)
- Lower energy cost initially
- Skilled guard players can neutralize top pressure
- Strong defensive position if sweep fails

**Guard Player Priorities:**
- Master [[Closed Guard Bottom]] retention (80%+ goal)
- Develop 3-5 high-percentage sweeps
- Chain sweeps with submissions
- Learn to maintain top positions once swept
- Competition strategy: Pull guard early, build point lead

### The Top Game Framework

**Strategic Philosophy:** Pass guard immediately, establish control, advance methodically, finish

**Position Progression:**
1. **Stand** in opponent's guard or force standing
2. **Pass guard** systematically ([[Knee Cut Position]], [[Leg Drag Position]], pressure passing)
3. **Establish [[Side Control]]** (85% retention allows rest/pressure)
4. **Advance to [[Mount]]** or [[Knee on Belly]] (50-65% success)
5. **Take [[Back Control]]** if opponent turns (55-70% success)
6. **Submit** from maximum dominance (60-80% success)

**Top Player Advantages:**
- Positional scoring throughout match
- Pressure exhausts opponent
- Dominant positions lead to highest submission percentages
- Control match pace and tempo

**Top Player Priorities:**
- Master guard passing (65%+ success goal)
- Develop heavy [[Side Control]] pressure
- Learn [[Mount]] maintenance (75%+ retention)
- Study submission chains from dominant positions
- Competition strategy: Pass early, accumulate points, maintain pressure

### The Leg Lock Framework

**Strategic Philosophy:** Engage legs immediately, enter entanglement system, submit or sweep

**Position Progression:**
1. **Pull guard** to sitting position
2. **Enter leg entanglement** ([[Ashi Garami]] or [[Inside Sankaku]])
3. **Control position** while threatening submissions
4. **Submit** via heel hook or ankle lock (40-75% depending on position)
5. **Sweep** if submission defended (30-60% success)
6. **Re-enter** leg entanglement or advance to [[Back Control]]

**Leg Lock Player Advantages:**
- Many opponents lack leg defense experience
- Heel hooks finish extremely fast
- Position control while attacking
- Modern meta in no-gi competition

**Leg Lock Player Priorities:**
- Master [[Ashi Garami]] entries (60%+ success)

## Expert Approaches to Positions

Understanding how top practitioners conceptualize positions provides insight into high-level strategy.

### John Danaher: Systematic Position Theory

**Core Philosophy:** Positions exist in hierarchical systems with predictable pathways. Mastery comes from understanding the system, not memorizing techniques.

**Danaher Position Approach:**
1. **Inside Position Theory**: Control the inside space in every position
2. **Control Hierarchies**: Some controls matter more than others (e.g., head control > arm control)
3. **Systematic Attacks**: Create sequences where opponent's defense to A opens B
4. **Positional Pressure**: Use position to drain opponent energy before attacking
5. **Back Attack System**: Every position should have path to [[Back Control]]

**Danaher on [[Mount]]:** "The mount is not about crushing your opponent with weight. It's about creating geometric problems where every defensive movement creates a worse problem."

**Danaher on [[Closed Guard Bottom]]:** "The closed guard is a systematic position where you force the opponent to choose between maintaining posture (where you sweep) or breaking posture (where you submit)."

**Danaher on Leg Entanglements:** Created comprehensive leg lock system with clear positional hierarchy from [[Ashi Garami]] to [[Inside Sankaku]], treating legs as equal submission targets to upper body.

### Gordon Ryan: Competition-Focused Positioning

**Core Philosophy:** Positions should create decision dilemmas where opponent's correct defense to one attack opens another. Everything builds toward back attacks and leg locks.

**Gordon Ryan Position Approach:**
1. **Pressure and Problems**: Use body pressure to create constant problems
2. **Dilemma Creation**: Attack A and B simultaneously so defending one exposes other
3. **Dynamic Control**: Float between position variations to prevent opponent settling
4. **Time Management**: Use positions to drain opponent's energy/time
5. **Finish-Oriented**: Every position maintained to create finishing opportunity

**Gordon Ryan on [[Side Control]]:** Uses floating side control, constantly shifting weight to prevent opponent from timing escapes. "They can't escape what they can't predict."

**Gordon Ryan on [[Closed Guard Bottom]]:** Rarely plays closed guard in competition, preferring open guards that lead to [[Ashi Garami]] or immediate sweeps. "Why wait to break posture when I can sweep immediately?"

**Gordon Ryan on Modern BJJ:** "The most dominant players establish their best positions fastest. Buchecha takes top position. I take inside sankaku. Both win."

### Eddie Bravo: Innovation and Unorthodox Systems

**Core Philosophy:** Traditional positions can be reimagined with creative control mechanisms. Flexibility and unorthodox thinking create opportunities opponents don't expect.

**Eddie Bravo Position Approach:**
1. **Rubber Guard System**: Transform [[Closed Guard Bottom]] into attacking position
2. **Lockdown Half Guard**: Control opponent's leg to neutralize passing
3. **Truck Position**: Back attack variation from [[Turtle Position]]
4. **Twister**: Specialized submission from [[Truck Position]]
5. **10th Planet System**: Interconnected positions flow from one to another

**Eddie Bravo on [[Closed Guard Bottom]]:** "Traditional closed guard is passive. Rubber guard gives me control like I have mount, but from bottom." Created [[Mission Control]] and [[Rubber Guard]] variations.

**Eddie Bravo on [[Half Guard Bottom]]:** Pioneered [[Lockdown Guard]] with figure-four leg control: "If I can't sweep immediately, I'll control their leg so completely they can't pass either."

**Eddie Bravo on Position Innovation:** "Everyone does the same techniques from the same positions. Find new controls, find new positions, find new attacks."
