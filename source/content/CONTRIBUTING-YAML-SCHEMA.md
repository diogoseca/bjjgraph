## Best Practices

### Content Writing Guidelines

1. **Wikilink Consistency**
   - Always use `[[Position Name]]` for internal links
   - Match exact position/technique names
   - Check for existing pages before creating new ones

2. **Success Rate Calibration**
   - Beginner: 20-60% typical range
   - Intermediate: 40-75% typical range
   - Advanced: 60-95% typical range
   - Defensive positions generally lower retention rates
   - Offensive positions generally higher success rates

3. **Expert Insights Format**
   - Always include all three: Danaher, Gordon Ryan, Eddie Bravo
   - Each 2-3 sentences maximum
   - Focus on different aspects (technical, competitive, innovative)
   - Write as if quoting the expert (third person)

4. **Common Errors Section**
   - Minimum 3 errors per page
   - Format: Error â†’ Consequence â†’ Correction
   - Include recognition tips
   - Focus on safety for submissions

5. **Tag Usage**
   - First line: `#bjj #[category] #[specific tags]`
   - Categories: position, transition, submission, concept, system
   - Add specific tags: fundamental, guard, sweep, choke, etc.

### SEO Optimization

1. **Title Templates**
   - Positions: `"[Name] | BJJ Position Guide | BJJ Graph"`
   - Transitions: `"[Name] | BJJ Technique | BJJ Graph"`
   - Submissions: `"[Name] | BJJ Submission | BJJ Graph"`
   - Concepts: `"[Name] | BJJ Concept | BJJ Graph"`
   - Systems: `"[Name] | BJJ System | BJJ Graph"`

2. **Description Templates**
   - Positions: `"Master [Name] in BJJ. Complete guide covering [key aspects]. Success rates: Beginner X%, Intermediate Y%, Advanced Z%."`
   - Transitions: `"Learn [Name] in BJJ. Step-by-step execution from [Start] to [End]. Success: Beginner X%, Intermediate Y%, Advanced Z%."`
   - Submissions: `"Learn [Name] in BJJ. Complete guide from [Position]. Success: Beginner X%, Intermediate Y%, Advanced Z%. Safety-first approach."`

3. **Keyword Integration**
   - Primary keyword in title
   - Primary keyword in description
   - Secondary keywords in H2 headers
   - Natural language (avoid keyword stuffing)

### State Machine Integration

1. **ID Uniqueness**
   - Maintain central registry of IDs
   - Check for duplicates before assigning
   - Sequential numbering recommended

2. **Transition Completeness**
   - Every position should have offensive transitions
   - Every position should have defensive responses
   - Link to real technique pages

3. **Success Rate Consistency**
   - If Position A â†’ Position B has 70% success
   - And Position B â†’ Position C has 60% success
   - Then Position A â†’ Position C should be ~42% (70% Ã— 60%)

4. **Decision Tree Logic**
   - Use if/else if/else structure
   - Cover all major defensive scenarios
   - Include probability estimates
   - Format consistently

## Schema.org Integration

### HowTo Schema (Positions & Transitions)

All position and transition files should include Schema.org HowTo markup:

```html
<script type="application/ld+json">
{
  "@context": "https://schema.org",
  "@type": "HowTo",
  "name": "How to Use [Position/Technique] in BJJ",
  "description": "Complete guide to executing techniques from [Position].",
  "step": [
    {
      "@type": "HowToStep",
      "name": "Execute [Technique]",
      "text": "From this position, execute [Technique] to transition to [Result].",
      "position": 1
    }
  ],
  "tool": [
    "BJJ Gi or No-Gi attire",
    "Training partner",
    "Mat space"
  ],
  "totalTime": "PT5M"
}
</script>
```

### FAQ Schema (Optional Enhancement)

For position files with common errors:

```html
<script type="application/ld+json">
{
  "@context": "https://schema.org",
  "@type": "FAQPage",
  "mainEntity": [
    {
      "@type": "Question",
      "name": "What is a common mistake in [Error]?",
      "acceptedAnswer": {
        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "[Consequence]. The correction is: [Fix]."
      }
    }
  ]
}
</script>
```

### Schema Best Practices

1. **Structured Data Placement**
   - Place immediately after YAML frontmatter
   - Before main content headers
   - One HowTo schema per page
   - Optional FAQ schema for detailed pages

2. **Step Generation**
   - Extract from offensive transitions
   - Order by success rate or logical flow
   - Include starting position in text
   - Limit to 5-8 steps for readability

3. **Tool Array**
   - Standard tools for all BJJ content:
     - "BJJ Gi or No-Gi attire"
     - "Training partner"
     - "Mat space"
   - Add specific tools if needed

4. **Time Estimation**
   - Use ISO 8601 duration format
   - PT5M = 5 minutes (typical)
   - Adjust based on technique complexity

## SEO Schema Patterns

This section documents the different schema patterns used across BJJ Graph content types, with specific guidance on when to use each pattern and how they differ.

### Educational HowTo vs Technical HowTo

BJJ Graph uses two distinct HowTo schema patterns depending on content type:

#### Educational HowTo (Learning Articles)
**Purpose**: Teach conceptual understanding and learning progression
**Timeframe**: PT10M to PT12M (10-12 minutes reading time)
**Step Focus**: Educational concepts, not physical execution

**Example - Understanding a Concept:**
```json
{
  "@context": "https://schema.org",

### FAQ Schema Standards

FAQ schema requirements differ between content types based on educational depth and audience needs.

#### Standard FAQ (Positions/Transitions) - 5 Questions Minimum
**Audience**: Practitioners seeking technique clarification
**Answer Length**: 1-2 sentences
**Focus**: Technical execution, common mistakes, success rates

**Example:**
```json
{
  "@context": "https://schema.org",
  "@type": "FAQPage",
  "mainEntity": [
    {
      "@type": "Question",
      "name": "What is the success rate for Hip Bump Sweep?",
      "acceptedAnswer": {
        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "Hip Bump Sweep success rates are: Beginner 50%, Intermediate 70%, Advanced 85%. Success increases with better timing and opponent posture recognition."
      }
    },
    {
      "@type": "Question",
      "name": "What is the most common mistake with Hip Bump Sweep?",
      "acceptedAnswer": {
        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "The most common mistake is attempting the sweep without first breaking opponent's posture. This results in opponent posting their hand to prevent the sweep (failure rate 70%)."
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

#### Enhanced FAQ (Learning Articles) - 6-8 Questions
**Audience**: Students seeking comprehensive understanding
**Answer Length**: 2-3 sentences with specific data
**Focus**: Conceptual understanding, strategic application, comparisons

**Example:**
```json
{
  "@context": "https://schema.org",
  "@type": "FAQPage",
  "mainEntity": [
    {
      "@type": "Question",
      "name": "What is positional hierarchy in BJJ?",
      "acceptedAnswer": {
        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "Positional hierarchy in BJJ is the systematic ranking of positions from neutral to dominant, where each position offers increasing control, submission opportunities, and point values. The hierarchy progresses from standing (0 points) to guard (0 points) to guard passing (3 points) to pins (4 points) to submissions (match win). This structure reflects biomechanical advantages where certain body configurations provide more control than others."
      }
    },
    {
      "@type": "Question",
      "name": "How does the IBJJF point system reflect positional hierarchy?",
      "acceptedAnswer": {
        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "The IBJJF point system awards points based on positional advancement: Guard Pass (3 points), Knee on Belly (2 points), Mount/Back Control (4 points), Sweep (2 points), Takedown (2 points). Higher point values reflect positions with greater control and submission potential, directly mirroring the hierarchical structure."
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

**FAQ Standards by Content Type:**

| Content Type | Minimum Questions | Answer Length | Data Requirements |
|--------------|------------------|---------------|-------------------|
| Positions | 5 | 1-2 sentences | Success rates, common errors |
| Transitions | 5 | 1-2 sentences | Success rates, physical requirements |
| Submissions | 6 | 2-3 sentences | Safety data, success rates, injuries |
| Learning Articles | 6-8 | 2-3 sentences | Statistics, comparisons, strategic data |
| Concepts | 5 | 1-2 sentences | Applications, principles |
| Systems | 5 | 2-3 sentences | System components, strategic value |

### ItemList Schema Usage

ItemList schema is used for rankings, categorical lists, and Top 10 patterns. It's primarily used in Learning articles and hub pages.

#### When to Use ItemList

**Use ItemList for:**
- Ranked lists (Top 10 Submissions, Best Guards for Beginners)
- Categorical organization (All Guards by Type)
- Learning progressions (White Belt â†’ Black Belt techniques)
- Comparison rankings (Success Rates by Position)

**Do NOT use ItemList for:**
- Simple bulleted lists
- Navigation menus
- Unordered collections
- Related content suggestions

#### ItemList Examples

**Ranking Pattern (Top 10):**
```json
{
  "@context": "https://schema.org",
  "@type": "ItemList",
  "name": "Top 10 BJJ Submissions by Success Rate",
  "description": "Highest percentage submissions in competition ranked by success rate across all belt levels",
  "itemListElement": [
    {
      "@type": "ListItem",
      "position": 1,
      "name": "Rear Naked Choke",
      "url": "https://bjjgraph.com/submissions/rear-naked-choke",
      "description": "75% average success rate from back control"
    },
    {
      "@type": "ListItem",
      "position": 2,
      "name": "Armbar from Mount",
      "url": "https://bjjgraph.com/submissions/armbar-from-mount",
      "description": "68% average success rate from mount position"
    }
  ]
}
```

**Categorical Pattern (Guard Types):**
```json
{
  "@context": "https://schema.org",
  "@type": "ItemList",
  "name": "BJJ Guard Types by Category",
  "description": "Complete list of Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu guard positions organized by category",
  "itemListElement": [
    {
      "@type": "ListItem",
      "position": 1,
      "name": "Closed Guard Bottom",
      "url": "https://bjjgraph.com/positions/closed-guard-bottom"
    },
    {
      "@type": "ListItem",
      "position": 2,
      "name": "Open Guard Bottom",
      "url": "https://bjjgraph.com/positions/open-guard-bottom"
    }
  ]
}
```

### Multiple Schema Coordination

Learning articles use 5 concurrent schemas that work together without conflict. Here's how they coordinate:

**Schema Stack for Learning Articles:**

1. **WebPage** (Base layer)
   - Identifies page as part of bjjgraph.com
   - Provides basic metadata
   - Required for all pages

2. **BreadcrumbList** (Navigation layer)
   - Shows page location in site hierarchy
   - Includes "Learning" category level
   - Helps Google understand content organization

3. **HowTo** (Educational layer)
   - Teaches conceptual progression
   - PT10M-PT12M reading timeframe
   - Educational steps, not technical execution

4. **FAQPage** (Q&A layer)
   - 6-8 detailed questions
   - 2-3 sentence answers with data
   - Addresses common student questions

5. **ItemList** (Organizational layer - when applicable)
   - Rankings or categorical organization
   - Only included when content has ranked/ordered lists
   - Optional based on content structure

**Coordination Rules:**
- All 5 schemas use same `@context`: "https://schema.org"
- Each schema in separate `<script type="application/ld+json">` tag
- Ordered: WebPage â†’ BreadcrumbList â†’ HowTo â†’ FAQ â†’ ItemList (if present)
- No overlapping properties between schemas
- Total schema markup: 3-5 KB per page (acceptable overhead)

**Example Schema Placement in Learning Article:**
```html
---
title: "Article Title"
description: "Article description"
---

<script type="application/ld+json">
{WebPage schema}
</script>

<script type="application/ld+json">
{BreadcrumbList schema}
</script>

<script type="application/ld+json">
{HowTo schema}
</script>

<script type="application/ld+json">
{FAQPage schema}
</script>

<script type="application/ld+json">
{ItemList schema - if applicable}
</script>

### Automated Validation

Consider creating validation scripts that check:
- YAML syntax validity
- Required field presence
- ID format correctness
- Success rate format
- Wikilink validity
- Schema.org markup presence

Example validation points:
```javascript
// Check State ID format
const stateIdRegex = /^S\d{3}$/;
if (!stateIdRegex.test(stateId)) {
  errors.push("Invalid State ID format");
}

// Check success rate format
const successRateRegex = /Beginner \d+%, Intermediate \d+%, Advanced \d+%/;
if (!successRateRegex.test(successRate)) {
  errors.push("Invalid success rate format");
}
```
