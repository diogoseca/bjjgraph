## Best Practices

### Content Writing Guidelines

1. **Wikilink Consistency**
   - Always use `[[Position Name]]` for internal links
   - Match exact position/technique names
   - Check for existing pages before creating new ones

2. **Success Rate Calibration**
   - Beginner: 20-60% typical range
   - Intermediate: 40-75% typical range
   - Advanced: 60-95% typical range
   - Defensive positions generally lower retention rates
   - Offensive positions generally higher success rates

3. **Expert Insights Format**
   - Always include all three: Danaher, Gordon Ryan, Eddie Bravo
   - Each 2-3 sentences maximum
   - Focus on different aspects (technical, competitive, innovative)
   - Write as if quoting the expert (third person)

4. **Common Errors Section**
   - Minimum 3 errors per page
   - Format: Error â†’ Consequence â†’ Correction
   - Include recognition tips
   - Focus on safety for submissions

5. **Tag Usage**
   - First line: `#bjj #[category] #[specific tags]`
   - Categories: position, transition, submission, concept, system
   - Add specific tags: fundamental, guard, sweep, choke, etc.

### SEO Optimization

1. **Title Templates**
   - Positions: `"[Name] | BJJ Position Guide | BJJ Graph"`
   - Transitions: `"[Name] | BJJ Technique | BJJ Graph"`
   - Submissions: `"[Name] | BJJ Submission | BJJ Graph"`
   - Concepts: `"[Name] | BJJ Concept | BJJ Graph"`
   - Systems: `"[Name] | BJJ System | BJJ Graph"`

2. **Description Templates**
   - Positions: `"Master [Name] in BJJ. Complete guide covering [key aspects]. Success rates: Beginner X%, Intermediate Y%, Advanced Z%."`
   - Transitions: `"Learn [Name] in BJJ. Step-by-step execution from [Start] to [End]. Success: Beginner X%, Intermediate Y%, Advanced Z%."`
   - Submissions: `"Learn [Name] in BJJ. Complete guide from [Position]. Success: Beginner X%, Intermediate Y%, Advanced Z%. Safety-first approach."`

3. **Keyword Integration**
   - Primary keyword in title
   - Primary keyword in description
   - Secondary keywords in H2 headers
   - Natural language (avoid keyword stuffing)

### State Machine Integration

1. **ID Uniqueness**
   - Maintain central registry of IDs
   - Check for duplicates before assigning
   - Sequential numbering recommended

2. **Transition Completeness**
   - Every position should have offensive transitions
   - Every position should have defensive responses
   - Link to real technique pages

3. **Success Rate Consistency**
   - If Position A â†’ Position B has 70% success
   - And Position B â†’ Position C has 60% success
   - Then Position A â†’ Position C should be ~42% (70% Ã— 60%)

4. **Decision Tree Logic**
   - Use if/else if/else structure
   - Cover all major defensive scenarios
   - Include probability estimates
   - Format consistently

## Schema.org Integration

### HowTo Schema (Positions & Transitions)

All position and transition files should include Schema.org HowTo markup:

```html
<script type="application/ld+json">
{
  "@context": "https://schema.org",
  "@type": "HowTo",
  "name": "How to Use [Position/Technique] in BJJ",
  "description": "Complete guide to executing techniques from [Position].",
  "step": [
    {
      "@type": "HowToStep",
      "name": "Execute [Technique]",
      "text": "From this position, execute [Technique] to transition to [Result].",
      "position": 1
    }
  ],
  "tool": [
    "BJJ Gi or No-Gi attire",
    "Training partner",
    "Mat space"
  ],
  "totalTime": "PT5M"
}
</script>
```

### FAQ Schema (Optional Enhancement)

For position files with common errors:

```html
<script type="application/ld+json">
{
  "@context": "https://schema.org",
  "@type": "FAQPage",
  "mainEntity": [
    {
      "@type": "Question",
      "name": "What is a common mistake in [Error]?",
      "acceptedAnswer": {
        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "[Consequence]. The correction is: [Fix]."
      }
    }
  ]
}
</script>
```

### Schema Best Practices

1. **Structured Data Placement**
   - Place immediately after YAML frontmatter
   - Before main content headers
   - One HowTo schema per page
   - Optional FAQ schema for detailed pages

2. **Step Generation**
   - Extract from offensive transitions
   - Order by success rate or logical flow
   - Include starting position in text
   - Limit to 5-8 steps for readability

3. **Tool Array**
   - Standard tools for all BJJ content:
     - "BJJ Gi or No-Gi attire"
     - "Training partner"
     - "Mat space"
   - Add specific tools if needed

4. **Time Estimation**
   - Use ISO 8601 duration format
   - PT5M = 5 minutes (typical)
   - Adjust based on technique complexity
