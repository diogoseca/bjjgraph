# Remaining TODOs for Developers

**Last Updated**: October 12, 2025 (after 10-agent parallel execution)

**Overall Completion**: ~92% of critical/high priority work

---

## What's Been Completed

Via 10 parallel agents on October 12, 2025:
- ✅ Fixed 8 duplicate State/Submission IDs
- ✅ Added schema markup to 51 files (Concepts + Systems) - 100% coverage achieved
- ✅ Added safety sections to 18 submissions
- ✅ Added execution steps to 14 submissions
- ✅ Added visual descriptions to 37 positions (59% complete)
- ✅ Enhanced visual sequences in 47 submissions (94% complete)
- ✅ All 50 submissions have Common Errors sections

**Total work completed**: ~131 files modified, ~35-40 hours of manual effort automated

---

## High Priority Tasks (~15-20 hours remaining)

### 1. Complete Visual Descriptions for Positions (26 files remaining)

**Status**: 37/63 completed (59%)

**Remaining**: 26 position files still need Visual Description sections

**What's needed**:
- 4-8 sentences per position (minimum 300 characters, aim for 400-700)
- Anatomical details: body positioning, contact points, weight distribution
- Describe both top and bottom perspectives where applicable
- Explain what makes the position unique

**Options**:
1. **Automated**: Let content-improvement-bot handle these (runs hourly, 5 files/hour = ~5 hours of bot runtime)
2. **Manual**: Complete remaining 26 files manually (~6-8 hours)

**Priority**: HIGH - Improves content quality and SEO

**Reference**: `/source/content/Positions/CONTRIBUTING-POSITIONS.md`

---

### 2. Optional: Upgrade Common Errors Format (35+ files)

**Status**: All 50 submissions have Common Errors sections ✅

**Opportunity**: Upgrade from simplified 3-error format to comprehensive 5-10 error format

**Current state**:
- 35+ files use simplified format (3 errors per file)
- 15 files already use enhanced format (5-10 errors with detailed structure)

**What upgrade involves**:
- Expand from 3 errors to 5-10 errors per file
- Add numbered format (### 1., ### 2., etc.)
- Include 2-3 sentence descriptions for each component
- Add at least 1-2 errors labeled ⚠️ DANGER for safety-critical issues
- Add detailed consequences and corrections

**Priority**: MEDIUM - Quality upgrade, not required for functionality

**Estimated time**: 15-20 minutes per file (~9-12 hours for 35 files)

**Note**: This is optional quality enhancement, not critical functionality

---

## Medium Priority Tasks (~5-8 hours)

### Content Enhancement

#### Beginner Summaries
- Add "Beginner's Summary" to top 20 high-traffic Position pages (~30 min)
- Add "Beginner's Summary" to top 20 high-traffic Transition pages (~25 min)

**What it is**: 2-3 sentence summary at top of page for beginners

**Priority**: MEDIUM - Improves user experience for new practitioners

#### FAQ Sections
- Create FAQ sections on top 10 Position pages (~45 min)
- Create FAQ sections on top 10 Transition pages (~40 min)

**What it is**: Extract from "Common Errors" and expand into Q&A format

**Priority**: MEDIUM - Enhances SEO with FAQ schema

#### Content Depth
- Expand "Common Mistakes" section in Transition pages (~60 min)
- Add prerequisite sections to Position pages (~45 min)
- Add "Related States" section to pages missing it (~30 min)

**Priority**: LOW-MEDIUM - Quality improvements

## Ongoing Tasks

### SEO Monitoring (Weekly/Monthly)

**Weekly**:
- Check Google Search Console for errors
- Monitor indexing status (goal: 90%+ indexed)
- Review rich results eligibility
- Track any crawl errors or warnings

**Monthly**:
- Review traffic metrics vs. baseline
- Identify top-performing pages
- Check for any schema errors
- Monitor average position for target keywords
- Update hub pages with new content
- Run validation script on new pages

**Tools**:
- Google Search Console
- Google Rich Results Test
- Schema.org Validator

**Reference**: `/docs/seo-validation-guide.md` and `/docs/deployment-checklist.md`

---

### Validation & Quality Assurance

**After October 12-13 content creation (345+ files)**:
- Add schema markup via Python scripts (`add_position_schema_v2.py`, `add_transition_schema_v2.py`, `add_breadcrumb_schema.py`, `add_webpage_schema.py`)
- Run validation: `python3 scripts/validate_content.py source/content/ --verbose`
- Review and quality assurance for newly created files

**As needed**:
- Fix broken wikilinks as new files are created
- Run `python3 scripts/validate_content.py` periodically
- Validate schema markup with Google Rich Results Test
- Check for duplicate IDs when adding new content

**Note**: Many broken wikilinks will resolve automatically as new files are created from `new_files_to_create.md`

## Summary

**What's done (92% of critical/high priority work):**
- All critical fixes complete (duplicate IDs, schema markup, safety sections)
- Most high-priority content complete (execution steps, safety sections)
- Partial completion of visual enhancements (37/63 positions, 47/50 submissions)

**What remains (~20-25 hours total):**
- **HIGH**: Complete 26 position visual descriptions (6-8 hours or automated)
- **MEDIUM**: Optional quality upgrades (common errors format, beginner summaries, FAQ sections) - 14-17 hours
- **ONGOING**: SEO monitoring and validation (weekly/monthly)

**Automation available:**
- content-improvement-bot.yml runs hourly (5 files/hour)
- content-growth-bot.yml runs hourly (creates new files from priority list)
- Combined automation: 240 file improvements per day potential

**Best approach**: Let automation handle remaining visual descriptions over next few days, focus manual effort on SEO monitoring and new content creation.
