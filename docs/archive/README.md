## Contents

### SEO Implementation Files (Archived October 14, 2025)

**seo-implementation-complete.md** and **seo-final-summary.md**

**Why archived:** These two files contained 80% duplicate content (50KB total, ~15KB redundancy). They have been consolidated into a single comprehensive `seo-implementation-report.md` in `/docs/seo/`.

**Historical Context:** Both files documented the October 2025 SEO implementation with 30 tasks tracked and 598+ schema instances deployed. The new consolidated report maintains all unique information while eliminating redundancy.

**Replacement:** See `/docs/seo/seo-implementation-report.md` for current implementation tracking.

### Script Documentation (Archived October 14, 2025)

**VALIDATION_SUMMARY.md** and **README_TRANSITION_SCHEMA_V2.md**

**Why archived:** Redundant with main script documentation. VALIDATION_SUMMARY.md duplicated content in `/scripts/README.md`, and README_TRANSITION_SCHEMA_V2.md duplicated examples in EXAMPLES.md.

**Historical Context:** These files provided validation rules and transition schema documentation that have been merged into primary script documentation.

**Replacement:**
- Validation: See `/scripts/README.md#validate_contentpy`
- Schema examples: See `/docs/scripts/EXAMPLES.md`

### validation-report-2025-10-12.md
**Comprehensive content validation report (October 12, 2025)**

Contains:
- 253 files validated
- 554 errors identified
- 5,325 warnings
- Detailed breakdown by content type
- Error examples and common issues

**Historical Context**: This report was generated during the content quality improvement phase. Most issues have since been resolved by the content-improvement-bot (automated GitHub Actions workflow).

### prompts/
**Agent prompt templates (archived)**

Contains:
- `100_new_files_continue.txt` - Continuation prompt for content generation
- `100_new_files_of_content.txt` - Batch content creation prompt

**Historical Context**: These prompts were used for early content generation experiments. They have been superseded by:
- GitHub Actions content-improvement-bot workflow (`.github/workflows/content-improvement-bot.yml`)
- CONTRIBUTING-*.md files in `/source/content/`

**Current Usage**: The content-improvement-bot now uses the CONTRIBUTING-*.md standards directly rather than these prompt templates.
