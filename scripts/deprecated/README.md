# Deprecated Scripts

**Archived scripts - superseded by V2 implementations**

‚ö†Ô∏è **These scripts are no longer maintained and should not be used for new work.**

---

## Why These Scripts Were Deprecated

### V1 Schema Scripts (Replaced by V2)

The following scripts used an older schema structure that has been superseded:

- **add_position_schema.py** ‚Üí Replaced by `seo/add_position_schema_v2.py`
- **add_transition_schema.py** ‚Üí Replaced by `seo/add_transition_schema_v2.py`

**Key improvements in V2**:
- Unified YAML frontmatter structure
- Better HowTo schema with detailed steps
- FAQ schema extracted from Knowledge Assessment
- Physical requirements as "supply" items
- More accurate success rate mapping
- Better integration with content standards

**Migration**: All pages have been updated to V2. Do not use V1 scripts.

---

### Meta Scripts (One-time use, now redundant)

These scripts were used for one-time migrations:

- **add_position_meta.py** - Added meta titles/descriptions (completed October 12, 2025)
- **add_transition_meta.py** - Added meta titles/descriptions (completed October 12, 2025)

**Why deprecated**: All pages now have proper frontmatter. New pages should follow CONTRIBUTING-*.md standards from the start.

---

### One-Time Fix Scripts

These scripts addressed specific issues that have been resolved:

- **fix_remaining_frontmatter.py** - Fixed frontmatter issues (completed October 12, 2025)
- **fix_submission_frontmatter.py** - Fixed submission frontmatter (completed October 12, 2025)
- **add_internal_links.py** - Added internal links (completed October 12, 2025, later superseded by link_optimizer)

**Why deprecated**: Issues fixed, content standards updated, better tools now available.

## If You Need To Use These Scripts

**Don't.**

But if you absolutely must (e.g., for historical research):

1. **Check V2 first**: See if `scripts/seo/` has a V2 replacement
2. **Read the code**: Understand what it does before running
3. **Backup first**: Make a backup before running on content
4. **Test on one file**: Never run on entire directory without testing

**Better alternative**: Follow the content standards in `/source/content/CONTRIBUTING-*.md` for new content.
