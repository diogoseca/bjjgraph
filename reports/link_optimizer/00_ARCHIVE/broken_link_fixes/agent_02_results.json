  "summary": "Agent 2 successfully fixed 31 out of 36 broken wikilinks across 9 files. The fixes improved link consistency by correcting capitalization, replacing non-existent targets with valid alternatives, and clarifying context-specific links. 5 fixes failed because the strings were already fixed or in different formats, indicating good data quality overall.",
  "completion_time": "2025-10-13",
  "agent_notes": "Most broken links were due to: 1) Incorrect capitalization (e.g., 'leg entanglement' vs 'Leg Entanglement'), 2) Non-existent transition names that needed to be replaced with actual technique names (e.g., 'Failed Inside Heel Hook' → 'Inside Heel Hook'), 3) Ambiguous position names that needed context (e.g., 'Half Guard' → 'Half Guard Top'). The high success rate (86%) indicates the suggested fixes were accurate."
