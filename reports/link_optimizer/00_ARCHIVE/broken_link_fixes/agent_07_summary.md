### ⚠️ Not Needed (3 links)
- **Cross Collar Choke.md**: `[[Failed Cross Collar Choke]]` - Self-referential link, kept as is
- **Cross Face Control.md**: `[[Half Guard Pass]]` - This link is already correct
- **D'arce-Anaconda Connection.md**: `[[Guillotine Counter]]` → `[[Guillotine Control]]` - Already correct in file

### ❌ Failed/Not Found (4 links)

1. **Deep Half Entry.md**: `[[Half Guard Sweep]]` → `[[Half Guard Top]]`
   - String not found in expected location
   - May already be correct or in different format

2. **Defensive Position.md**: `[[Turtle Recovery]]` → `[[Posture Recovery]]`
   - String not found in file
   - Link may not exist or be in different location

3. **Defensive Position.md**: `[[Submission Chain]]` → `[[Submission Chains]]`
   - String not found in file
   - Link may already be correct

4. **De La Riva Sweep.md**: `[[Failed De La Riva Sweep]]`
   - Self-referential, not attempted

## Common Patterns Fixed

### Position Name Standardization
- `Side Control Top` → `Side Control` (9 instances across 5 files)
- `Side Control Bottom` → `Side Control to Mount` (4 instances across 3 files)
- `Mount Bottom` → `Side Control to Mount` (3 instances across 3 files)

### Transition/Technique Name Fixes
- `D'arce to Back Control` → `Turtle to Back Control` (3 instances)
- `Leg Entanglement Entry` → `Leg Entanglement` (3 instances)
- `Deep Half to X-Guard` → `Deep Half Guard` (3 instances)

### Control/Defense Terminology
- `Crossface Control` → `Cross Face Control` (2 instances)
- `Whizzer Counter` → `Whizzer Control` (2 instances)
- `Lockdown Half Guard` → `Lockdown Guard` (2 instances)

### Capitalization Fixes
- `switch to triangle` → `Switch to Triangle` (1 instance)

## Recommendations

### For Failed Links
1. **Deep Half Entry.md** - Manually verify if `Half Guard Sweep` link exists or needs updating
2. **Defensive Position.md** - Check if `Turtle Recovery` and `Submission Chain` links are present
3. Review self-referential links like `Failed Cross Collar Choke` for proper handling

### For Future Agents
- Schema markup sections (JSON-LD) were updated when broken links appeared there
- Decision tree sections often contain duplicate links that need fixing
- YAML frontmatter sometimes contains broken position references
- Watch for capitalization issues in wikilinks

## Notes
- Most fixes involved standardizing position names to their canonical forms
- HTML schema sections were updated alongside markdown content
- Some links like "Half Guard Pass" were already correct and didn't need fixing
- Self-referential links (technique linking to itself in failed state) were generally left alone
