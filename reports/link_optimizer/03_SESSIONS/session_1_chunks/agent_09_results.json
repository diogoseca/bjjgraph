  "summary": "Agent 9 processed 37 potential link fixes. Analysis revealed that all 37 broken links have either been fixed in previous cleanup sessions or never existed as actual wikilinks. The 4 instances found were template/format examples (e.g., 'Format: [[Threat Type]] → [[Resulting Position]]') rather than actual broken links requiring fixes. This indicates previous cleanup efforts were effective and these were false positives from the link analysis phase.",
