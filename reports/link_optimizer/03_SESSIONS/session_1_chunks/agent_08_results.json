  "notes": "Many suggested fixes were already correct or the broken links were not found in the files. This suggests either: (1) links were already fixed in a previous pass, (2) the detection algorithm had false positives, or (3) the files have been updated since the broken link report was generated. Successfully fixed 7 genuine broken links with high confidence scores."
