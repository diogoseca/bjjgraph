## Fix Patterns Identified

### Guard Pull Standardization
The most common issue was inconsistent naming of guard pull techniques. Fixed pattern:
- `[Position] Pull` → `[Position]` (direct to target state)
- This aligns with the state machine where guard pulls transition directly to guard positions

### Failed Submission References
Multiple references to "Failed [Submission]" were simplified:
- `Failed Rear Naked Choke` → `Rear Naked Choke`
- State machine handles failure logic separately

### Technical Name Variations
Standardized technical terminology:
- `Technical Stand-up Sweep` → `Technical Standup`
- `Standing Guard Break` → `Standing Guard`
- `Leg Knot Transition` → `Leg Knot Position`

### Position Type Clarifications
Corrected position type references:
- `Side Control Top` → `Side Control`
- `Closed Guard Top` → `Closed Guard Bottom`
- `Triangle Control` → `Arm Triangle Control` (where appropriate)

## Quality Metrics

## Next Steps
Agent 8 chunk complete. Ready for validation and integration with other agent results.
